Avengers: Endgame has surpassed Avatar to become the highest-grossing film of all time.
The Marvel Studios sequel, directed by Anthony and Joe Russo, earned over £2.3bn ($2.9bn) in revenue by Sunday, since being released in April. Avatar, directed by James Cameron, which was released in 2009, previously held the record as the highest grossing movie of all time , earning $2.79bn.
Alan Horn, co-chairman and chief creative officer of the Walt Disney Studios, said: “A huge congratulations to the Marvel Studios and Walt Disney Studios teams, and thank you to the fans around the world who lifted Avengers: Endgame to these historic heights.
“Of course, even with the passage of a decade, the impact of James Cameron’s Avatar remains as powerful as ever, and the astonishing achievements of both of these films are ongoing proof of the power of movies to move people and bring them together in a shared experience.”
Producer Kevin Feige announced the news at Comic Con on Saturday, saying it would be a “matter of days” before Endgame became “the biggest film in history” but added that “if you adjust for inflation, [James Cameron] still holds the title”.
Chris Hemsworth, who starred as Thor in Endgame, congratulated his team for the achievement in an Instagram post: “Thank you to all the fans around the world that lifted Avengers Endgame to historic heights making it the top grossing film of all time!”
Avengers: Endgame is the sequel to 2012’s The Avengers, 2015’s Avengers: Age of Ultron, and 2018’s Avengers: Infinity War and the 22nd film in the Marvel cinematic universe and the fourth blockbuster in the Avengers series.
The film, which was first released on 25 April stars Robert Downey Jr, Chris Evans, Scarlett Johansson and Chris Hemsworth. It earned $1.22bn in its initial April release, achieving the biggest global opening of all time.

He was my only child: Dad of 14-yr-old actor who died in car crash
Shivendra Singh, father of 14-year-old 'Sasural Simar Ka' fame child actor Shivlekh Singh who passed away recently in a car accident, said, "He was my only child." Speaking about the accident, Shivendra added, "My wife and I blanked out and when we woke up, we realised he was gone." They were returning to Raipur from Bilaspur when the accident happened.

Times Now
The TV industry went into a state of mourning last week when news of 14-year-old Shivlekh Singh’s death started doing the rounds. The teenager, who had acted in a number of shows, including Sasural Simar Ka and Bal Veer, among others, met with an accident on July 18 and died on the spot. His father, Shivendra Singh, mustered up the courage to talk about the unfortunate and heartbreaking incident and said that Shivlekh was his only son.
In an interview to a portal, Shivendra, who was in the same car with his wife, Lekhna, and Shivlekh, reveals, “The driver was hurt. My wife and I blanked out and when we woke up, we realised that our son was gone. I don't know what hit him. In fact, he was not even sitting in the front. We were rushed to the hospital but...”
The couple, along with their son, were returning from Bilaspur and were headed to Raipur when a speeding truck hit their car. While Shivendra, Lekhna and the driver of the car were injured in the accident, Shivlekh lost his life. Shivendra also confirmed that it was the truck driver's fault because of which the accident occurred. He added, “Shivlekh was my only child."



Once the news of Shivlekh’s death was made public on July 19, his co-stars were left in shock and couldn’t believe the news. Aastha Chaudhary, who shared screen space with him in the show Kesari Nandan, expressed her grief on social media and wrote, “Life is just so unfair….M still in shock …Shivlekh Singh you gone toooo soon . Rip.”



On the other hand, Shivlekh’s on-screen mother from the show Sriman Srimati, Sucheta Khanna, was quoted as saying that she was extremely shocked to hear about the 14-year-old actor’s demise. “It just shows how unpredictable our lives are. He was a very talented, disciplined, well-mannered and well-brought up boy,” she said in a report.

Stokes didn't ask us to not award 6 overthrows in WC final: Dharmasena
After a section of British media claimed that all-rounder Ben Stokes wanted umpires to not award England 6 overthrows in the 2019 World Cup final, umpire Kumar Dharmasena has said that no such request was made. Dharmasena further revealed that he apologised to New Zealand captain Kane Williamson the moment he realised he had made a mistake.
https://www.crictracker.com/kumar-dharmasena-concedes-erring-in-awarding-vital-runs-to-england-denies-ben-stokes-wanted-to-withdraw-overthrow-runs/?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts
CricTracker
It was another World Cup final for Kumar Dharmasena but this time, he hadn’t seen the best of days. The former Sri Lanka spinner, who is a top umpire in world cricket now, was slammed for awarding six runs to England after a throw from New Zealand’s Martin Guptill went for four overthrow runs after hitting the bat of a diving Ben Stokes at Lord’s on July 14. Former umpire Simon Taufel had later said that Dharmasena should have given five and not six runs to the chasing side. The extra run helped England tie the game and they went on to lift the trophy.
Dharmasena, 48, is nicknamed ‘unanduwa’ which roughly means ‘hard worker’ and he has shown his worth in the official’s role in the past. He was also in charge of the final of the World Cup in 2015 at the Melbourne Cricket Ground which also featured New Zealand as the losing side. The Black Caps might find it hard to swallow to fact that Dharmasena’s presence in their finals didn’t see the end results going their way.

England had needed 15 runs to win off the last over and after Stokes hit a six in the third ball, it was nine required off three. It was then when that overthrow drama took place and Stokes had come up with an apologising gesture after the ball went for four overthrows. Taufel had said that the second run shouldn’t have been added to England’s total since the batsmen (Stokes and Adil Rashid) hadn’t crossed when the fielder had released the throw.
Dharmasena later regretted giving the verdict. Speaking to Sunday Island, Sri Lanka, he said: “I made a judgmental call after consulting my colleague Marais Erasmus. It was like calling a no-ball or a wide and I couldn’t consult the third umpire. I was 100 per cent sure that the batsmen had crossed. It looked as if he had almost reached the popping crease.”
“I admit that I was wrong. I also admit that the rule has to change.”
Dharmasena also had his own take on the rule. “If the ball hits the stumps and goes for four, then it’s fine. But the moment the ball hits the bat or the batsmen, it’s got to be a dead ball.”
Meanwhile, a section of the British media had claimed that Stokes even went to the extent of asking the umpires to withdraw the four overthrow runs. Dharmasena rejected this version outright. He even had apologised to New Zealand skipper Kane Williamson the moment he realised that he had made a blunder.

MSK Prasad reveals why Rayudu wasn't picked after injuries to players
Chief selector MSK Prasad has revealed that injured opener Shikhar Dhawan was replaced by Rishabh Pant instead of Ambati Rayudu during 2019 World Cup as the team already had a reserve opener in KL Rahul and required a left-hander. He added that when all-rounder Vijay Shankar was injured, they called in Mayank Agarwal as the team needed a back-up opener.

Hindustan Times
Indian cricket team chief selector MSK Prasad stated that there was no confusion when it comes to replacing injured players during the recently concluded ICC World Cup 2019. Prasad also added the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) missed putting a release on the website regarding the replacements. A lot of questions were raised when Rishabh Pant was brought in as replacement for the injured opener Shikhar Dhawan and .KL Rahul, who batted at No. 4 in the first two matches, was promoted to open the batting with Vijay Shankar at No. 4. After Shankar sustained a toe injury, he was eventually replaced with a reserve opener in Mayank Agarwal.

However, Prasad justified their actions during the announcement of the squads for the tour of West Indies.
“With regards to the selection, there is a policy that in between the series or mega events like the World Cup, I don’t take press conferences which has led to a lot of speculation,” Prasad said on Sunday.
“When Shikhar Dhawan was injured, we already had a reserve opener in KL Rahul. At that juncture, we didn’t have a left-hander at the top. The team management requested for a lefthander. We had no other choice other than Rishabh Pant. We knew his capability. That’s the reason why we had to bring in a left-hander.

Grey sales of high-end phones causing ₹2,500 cr revenue loss: ICEA
The sale of high-end mobile phones in the grey market is causing an estimated loss of ₹2,500 crore annually, mobile industry body India Cellular and Electronics Association (ICEA) has claimed. It suggested imposing a maximum customs duty of ₹4,000 on handsets priced above ₹20,000 to stop the practice. Currently, a basic customs duty of 20% is imposed on imported handsets.
https://www.financialexpress.com/industry/grey-sales-of-high-end-phones-causing-revenue-loss-of-rs-2500-crore-icea/1651427/?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts
The Financial Express
Sale of high-end mobile phones in the grey market is causing an estimated loss of Rs 2,500 crore annually to the exchequer, mobile industry body India Cellular and Electronics Association has claimed. The industry body has suggested imposing a maximum customs duty of Rs 4,000 on handsets priced above Rs 20,000 to discourage duty evasion and wipe out the premium for illegal sales. A basic customs duty (BCD) of 20 per cent is imposed on imported handsets at present.
“High-end phones that are getting sold in the grey market are estimated to cause a loss of Rs 2,500 crore annually on account of non-payment of basic customs duty (BCD) and also goods and services tax,” India Cellular and Electronics Association (ICEA) Chairman Pankaj Mohindroo told PTI.
The industry body has requested Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman that the BCD of 20 per cent should continue but with a cap of Rs 4,000 on mobile phones priced above Rs 20,000, Mohindroo said. The step will wipe out high margins on the illegal sale of high-end handsets and give a boost to legal imports, the ICEA has reasoned.
“Revenue impact on this would be an additional duty of Rs 700 crore of BCD approximately, which will get netted off because of the reduction in duty on the legal import. Hence, there will be no net gain or net loss. The GST collection will, however, go up by over Rs 1,000 crore and the market environment will become much cleaner and regularised,” Mohindroo said.
The ICEA said that recent budget was focussed on promoting electronics manufacturing in the country with a provision to write off capital expenditure for under section of 35 AD of Income Tax act.
“The entire mobile phone and its components manufacturing ecosystem should be brought under the finally notified scheme,” he said.The industry body has requested the government to bring down GST on mobile phone parts to 12 per cent from 18 per cent at present as it is creating an inverted duty structure in the sector.
The GST on mobile phones is 12 per cent while 18 per cent on parts such as back covers, batteries, headphones etc. Mohindroo said that the inverted duty structure has led to a serious cash flow issue for manufacturers and is adversely impacting the competitiveness of locally-produced mobile phones.
India had two mobile phone factories in 2014 but now, it has 268 factories engaged in the manufacturing of mobile phones and their accessories. Prime Minister Narendra Modi during his 13th India-Japan annual summit had announced making India top mobile phone manufacturing destination.
Though there is a mechanism in GST to provide a refund of input tax credit (ITC), there is no way to provide a refund of accumulated ITC on the GST paid on capital goods and services in case of inverted structure. “All new manufacturers are investing heavily on Capex (capital expenditure) and business promotion for creating a brand image. GST on such expense is an additional cost to the manufacturer, as they are not allowed refund of such accumulated credit,” Mohindroo said.
The ICEA has urged the finance minister to reduce timeframe for refund of GST credits to at most a week. The industry body has also demanded input credit on manufacturing plant or shed, and canteen service, among others.

Kolkata: Three days after 12 Bengali actors joined the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), film and television actress Rimjhim Mitra on Sunday became a part of the party. Actor Surojit Choudhury and model Pamela Goswami also followed suit.
Notably, Rimjhim is a popular TV actress who won ‘Jhalak Dikhla Jaa Bangla’ in 2013 and was also seen in Bigg Boss Bangla. She also made her mark in films, like ‘Teen Yaari Katha’ and ‘Cross Connection’.
“I am not happy working under the monopolistic approach in the Bengali film and TV industry. I have felt cornered many times and this is the first time I am openly talking about supporting a party. I have joined the BJP as I found it welcoming,” Rimjhim said after she was handed the BJP flag by its state President Dilip Ghosh.
On July 18, 12 Bengali actors, including Parno Mittra, joined the BJP. The actors had joined the party in the presence of state BJP chief Dilip Ghosh and senior leader Mukul Roy in Delhi.

Three powerful improvised explosive devices (IEDs), suspected to have been planted by Naxals, were recovered by security forces from Chhattisgarh’s Bijapur district, police said today. The home-made bombs, weighing 15 kg, 9 kg and 5 kg, were unearthed yesterday by a joint team of the CRPF and the local police from the forests under Basaguda police station limits where a road construction work is underway, Bijapur Additional Superintendent of Police Mohit Garg told PTI. A road is being built from Basaguda (Bijapur) to Jagargunda in Sukma district, another insurgency-hit district. The 49km road is not only strategically important but also crucial for the people living in this inaccessible region, he said.
A bomb disposal squad immediately defused the explosives, which were spotted when security forces were carrying out patrolling near an under-construction bridge, the police officer said. Garg said last week, too, three powerful IEDs were recovered from two places in the same area, he said. Maoists regularly plant IEDs to target security forces during their anti-Naxal operations in the state.

The funds will be utilised to meet PEL's working capital needs and upcoming debt-related payment obligations, reports said. Recently, the company had made principal and coupon payments on outstanding debt of reportedly around ₹1,700 crore.

MUMBAI: Ajay Piramal-controlled Piramal Enterprises Ltd has raised  ₹1,500 crore from Standard Chartered Bank through non-convertible debentures (NCD), said two people aware of the development.
The money will be used to meet working capital requirements of the group, including for the lending business Piramal Capital and Housing Finance and for upcoming debt-related payment obligations, said the first person cited above, requesting anonymity as he is not authorized to speak with the media.
“The financing from Standard Chartered will go towards meeting near-term needs and has a repayment date in January 2020," he said.
According to Piramal Enterprises’ regulatory filings, in the past week, the company has made principal and coupon payments on outstanding debt worth around  ₹1,700 crore. These comprised large loans from HDFC Bank and Deutsche Bank, which had subscribed to NCDs worth  ₹1,000 crore and  ₹590 crore respectively in 2016, the filings showed.
An email sent to Piramal Group on 19 June did not elicit any response. A spokesperson for Standard Chartered declined to comment.
The financing from Standard Chartered is part of the group’s plans to raise more debt financing from long-term sources of funds, said the second person cited above.
“They (Piramal Enterprises) have significantly improved their borrowing mix towards long-term sources of funds. The company has raised nearly  ₹16,500 crore of bank loans and NCDs during the second half of fiscal 2019 and has reduced its exposure of commercial paper to  ₹8,900 crore from  ₹18,000 crore, in the same period," he said.
The company’s latest investor presentation says banks contributed 71% of its total borrowing mix as of 31 March, up from 49% at September end.
The group is also planning to tap foreign currency borrowings and further increase borrowing from banks, the presentation said.
On 9 July, rating agency Crisil reaffirmed a rating of A1+ on the commercial paper programme of Piramal Enterprises, followed by a reaffirmation of Piramal Capital and Housing Finance Ltd’s A1+ rating for its commercial paper programme worth  ₹10,500 crore.

No blanket ban on crypto trading in India yet, says govt
There is no blanket ban on cryptocurrency trading in India yet, Minister of State for Finance Anurag Thakur said. "Presently, there's no separate law for dealing with cryptocurrency-related issues. Hence, all concerned departments and law enforcement agencies...take action as per the relevant existing laws," he added. In 2018, RBI had barred banks from serving firms dealing with cryptocurrencies.

New Delhi: Despite banking restrictions put in place by the Reserve Bank of India, the country has not put any blanket ban on trading in cryptocurrencies yet, the government has clarified.
Responding to questions in the Rajya Sabha on whether the government has prohibited cryptocurrency in the country, Minister of State for Finance and Corporate Affairs Anurag Thakur this week said the answer was no.
"Presently, there is no separate law for dealing with issues relating to cryptocurrencies. Hence, all concerned departments and law enforcement agencies, such as RBI, Enforcement Directorate and Income Tax authorities, etc. take action as per the relevant existing laws," the Minister said.
"Similarly, police/courts take action on IPC (Indian Penal Code) offences. Further, in view of the risks and dangers associated with cryptocurrencies, (the) government and RBI have been issuing advisories, press releases and circulars to the public," he added.
Also Read | Cryptocurrency should be banned, says government official
Earlier the Reserve Bank of India issued a circular banning regulated entities from providing services to crypto businesses. The ban went into effect on July 6 last year, Bitcoin.com reported on Friday.
But a draft bill for banning cryptocurrency has been in the works for some time with Economic Affairs Secretary Subhash Chandra Garg leading the exercise.
According to the draft "Banning of Cryptocurrency and Regulation of Official Digital Currency Bill 2019", holding, selling or dealing in cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin could soon land you in jail for 10 years.
The draft has proposed a 10-year prison sentence for persons who "mine, generate, hold, sell, transfer, dispose, issue or deal in cryptocurrencies.
Besides making it completely illegal, the bill makes holding of cryptos a non-bailable offence.
A cryptocurrency is a digital or virtual currency that uses cryptography for security and is generally based on Blockchain technology, a distributed ledger enforced by a disparate network of computers. Bitcoin is the most popular cryptocurrency in the world.

Seniors purposely didn't perform, laughed after defeats: Naib
All-rounder Gulbadin Naib, who was Afghanistan's captain in 2019 World Cup, has claimed that his team's senior players didn't perform deliberately in the tournament. "They weren't giving attention to me. They laughed instead of being sad after defeats and didn't even look at me when asked to bowl," he added. Notably, Naib was removed from captaincy after the World Cup.

Afghanistan endured an extremely tough time at the 2019 World Cup. They lost all nine matches at the competition despite coming extremely close to victory on as many as three occasions. Their captain Gulbadin Naib looked a bit out of ideas at times and was unable to handle the pressure and after the tournament, has been sacked from the helm. He has now made some serious allegations against the senior cricketers in the team stating that they didn’t support him during the tough times.
Afghanistan were found wanting in demanding conditions against the teams like England, Australia, New Zealand and others. But they fared really well against their Asian neighbours and dragged India extremely close losing the game by only 11 runs. Their encounter against Pakistan went down to the wire and at one stage, were the favourites to win the match.

But the team, especially Gulbadin Naib, crumbled under pressure and Imad Wasim and Wahab Riaz took Pakistan home in a tense chase.
Gulbadin Naib was made the captain of the team just ahead of the World Cup and even the players like Mohammad Nabi and Rashid Khan had expressed their disappointment over the same. While the skipper never came out with controversial statements during the tournament, he has now accused some of the senior cricketers that they were not playing well deliberately.
He also claimed that they didn’t support him on the field whenever he used to ask them to bowl at times. “We depend mostly on seniors in the World Cup but they were deliberately not performing, not giving attention to me, they were laughing instead of being sad after defeats & even not looking at me when asked to bowl,” Naib was quoted as saying by Afghanistan journalist.

Gulbadin Naib has been sacked from captaincy now and Rashid Khan has been appointed the captain of the team across all the formats. He has assured the leg-spinner of all the required support and Rashid acknowledged the same in a tweet recently.

Dhoni still fit enough to play international cricket: Childhood coach
Reacting to the speculation around MS Dhoni's retirement, the former India captain's childhood coach Keshav Banerjee said, "Dhoni still has cricket left in him. I know that. He is still fit enough to play international cricket." "I feel they (selectors) should talk to Dhoni and make things clear...To me, he had a good World Cup and looked sharp," he added.

MS Dhoni is still fit to continue and if the Indian team wants the best out of him, the selectors should think of managing his workload properly, feels the former India captain’s childhood coach Keshav Banerjee.
The mystery surrounding Dhoni’s future was put to rest temporarily on Saturday after he decided to take a two-month break and serve his army regiment after a gruelling India Premier League season and the 2019 World Cup. It is no secret that Dhoni had already made himself unavailable for the tour of West Indies, but he has now informed the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) that he is joining the Parachute Regiment of the Territorial Army.
“Dhoni still has cricket left in him. I know that. He is still fit enough to play international cricket,” Banerjee told IANS.

Since the end of the World Cup where India lost in the semi-finals to New Zealand, talks have been rife about Dhoni’s retirement with selectors also reportedly not keen on assuring the 2007 World T20 and 2011 World Cup winning captain a place in the playing XI.
“I feel they (selectors) should talk to Dhoni and make things clear,” Banerjee said. “I know Dhoni very well since he was a boy. Not even his best friend would know when he will retire. So I really have no idea. But he looks fit as ever and is enjoying his game. To me, he had a good World Cup and looked sharp.”

Asked about youngsters like Rishabh Pant waiting in the wings, and whether Dhoni should make way for them, Banerjee opined: “He (Pant) needs guidance and who better than Dhoni to guide him. It is my personal opinion. I don’t know what BCCI will do. But if you ask me, they should manage Dhoni well from here on if they want him in the T20 World Cup as well. Dhoni does not need to play every series. That’s how Rishabh Pant can also fit in.”

Central agencies threatening TMC leaders to join BJP: Mamata
West Bengal Chief Minister and TMC supremo Mamata Banerjee on Sunday alleged that central agencies are threatening TMC leaders over chit fund scams if they don't join the BJP. "They are offering ₹2 crore and a petrol pump to our MLAs to switch," Mamata said. "Just like in Karnataka, the BJP is involved in horse-trading everywhere," Mamata further said.

The Quint
West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee on Sunday, 21 July, alleged that central agencies are threatening TMC leaders and elected representatives with prison term in chit fund scam cases, if they don't join the BJP.
Addressing the Martyrs' Day rally in Kolkata, the Trinamool Congress (TMC) chief accused the saffron party of luring TMC MLAs with money and other perks.

"The BJP is offering Rs 2 crore and a petrol pump to our MLAs to switch over... Just like in Karnataka, the BJP is indulging in horse trading everywhere. It is trying to replicate this model here, too," she alleged.
Reacting to her allegations, West Bengal BJP president Dilip Ghosh dared Banerjee to name the CBI officers who had allegedly threatened TMC leaders to join the saffron camp. She, however, had not named any central agency.
The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) and the Enforcement Directorate (ED) are separately probing two multi-crore-rupee Ponzi scheme cases in West Bengal.
MAMATA SAYS RAIL SERVICES CURTAILED, RAILWAYS REFUTES CHARGE
She also claimed rail services were curtailed to stop people from attending her rally, even as the Railways maintained that it was running a number of special trains in addition to the ones scheduled for the day.
RETURN BALLOT PAPERS: MAMATA CALLS LOK SABHA ELECTIONS A ‘MYSTERY’
She also requested the EC to conduct Panchayat and Municipal elections with ballot paper instead of EVMs.
“We tell the BJP, first return the black money you used in the elections. Return the black money and cut money – all that you have taken till now – and used for winning elections,” Banerjee said.
Banerjee’s nephew, Abhishek Banerjee also joined her call against EVMs in the rally.
He said, “Return democracy, we want ballots not (EVM) machines.”
WHY IS THIS SIGNIFICANT?
The Martyrs' Day rally is organised by the party every year on July 21 in the memory of 13 Youth Congress activists killed in police firing in 1993 during the Left Front regime in West Bengal. Banerjee was a leader of the Youth Congress at that time.
This time rally is being held in the backdrop of BJP's impressive performance in the Lok Sabha polls in which the party won 18 of the 42 seats in the state, only four less than the ruling TMC.

THE CONFLICT
BJP state president and MP Dilip Ghosh directed party workers to not allow TMC leaders to leave for Kolkata to participate in the rally if they did not return the "cut money" they had collected from people.
Following this, TMC leader and minister Chandrima Bhattacharya lodged an FIR against Ghosh.
TMC MP and Mamata’s nephew Abhishek Banerjee, speaking to The Quint, said that BJP will “not be allowed to divide Bengal.”
Around 5,000 policemen will be deployed to look after security at the rally and maintain normality.

Srinagar: Jammu and Kashmir National Conference (JKNC) president Farooq Abdullah on Saturday stressed that revoking Article 370 and Article 35-A will be equivalent to a constitutional coup. He went on to add that Article 370 is essential, unassailable and will remain in effect despite the "uneducated rants" of certain people.
While speaking at a party convention in Handwara area of Kupwara district, the former Jammu and Kashmir Chief Minister said, "Keeping in view the special circumstances (at the time of the accession of J&K to India), Article 370 was added to the Constitution of India. The Article will remain as it is until the final resolution of the issue of Jammu and Kashmir is not reached to."
"So until the issue is solved, no power on earth can touch the article 370. The uneducated rants of those who want to obliterate Article 370 are far-fetched, fanciful and devoid of any genuineness," added Farooq Abdullah.
The former J&K CM further added that if Article 35-A is annulled then all the successive presidential orders will get annulled automatically. He explained that it was the then Maharaja who gave the state subject rights to the people of the state in 1927.



He then shifted aim to the BJP-led Central government saying, "They are well aware of the fact that until National Conference remains in the state it will painstakingly protect the interests of the state. They are frightened of us."
"Anxious and unnerved, New Delhi has employed various henchmen in the state to frustrate the efforts of National Conference towards protecting the special status of our state," he added.
Earlier in the day, Union Defence Minister Rajnath Singh urged the people who are running the movement in Kashmir to sit and talk with all the stakeholders so that a conclusion can be reached.



However, he also asserted that the problem of Kashmir will get solved and no power in the world can stop it. "If somebody does not want a solution through talks then we know very well how a solution can be found," said the union minister.

Most mob lynching cases are fake: Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi
Union Minister for Minority Affairs Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi on Sunday said that most cases of mob lynching in the country are concocted and fake. Naqvi was responding to a question about Samajwadi Party leader Azam Khan's statement of Muslims being punished for not migrating to Pakistan after 1947. Congress's Randeep Surjewala criticised Naqvi saying BJP is trying to shield culprits.

Union Minister for Minority Affairs Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi told India Today on Sunday, 21 July that most of the cases of lynching are fake
This was in response to India Today’s question on Samajwadi Party leader Azam Khan’s statement of Muslims “serving a sentence” after the Partition.
Khan had said, “If Muslims went to Pakistan, they would not get this punishment. Why our ancestors did not go to Pakistan? They regarded India as their own country. Now they will be punished and they will have to endure,” adding that the Muslims of this country had been living a very “disgusting life”.
Naqvi’s statement’s was criticised by senior Congress leader Randeep Surjewala who accused the BJP of protecting the accused.
Quoting Surjewala, India Today reported, “BJP doesn’t feel anything for the minorities. Everyone in the ruling party is trying to shield the culprits.”
Since 2015, 98 people have been victims of mob lynchings across India. According to Indiaspend, 84% of the victims of lynchings due to cow-related violence were Muslims.
Naqvi isn’t alone when it comes to downplaying cases of mob lynchings.
Recently, Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar told The Print that the Saran lynching incident of two tribal men and a Muslim man shouldn’t be viewed as a case of “mob lynching” as three victims “had been caught stealing cattle”.
Kumar told The Print, “It is an unfortunate incident. But it should not be seen as mob lynching. Those killed were Nats (a Scheduled Tribe group) and those who killed them belong to downtrodden classes. The incident occurred when the three were caught red-handed stealing cattle. It resulted in angry villagers beating them up leading to their deaths. It is basically an incident arising due to local development.”
Another minister of the JD(U)-BJP state government said that it was a case of “law and order” since the victims weren’t forced to chant Jai Shri Ram.

Priyanka can lead Cong, non-Gandhi will cause split: Natwar
Former External Affairs Minister Natwar Singh on Sunday said that the decision of becoming Congress President lies with Priyanka Gandhi, adding that a non-Gandhi chief will cause the party to split. Natwar further said, "Earlier, [Rahul Gandhi] had said that nobody from the Gandhi family will become the Congress president." Only the Gandhi family can reverse the decision, Natwar added.

ANI
By  Ashoke Raj New Delhi [India], July 21 (ANI): With the Congress leadership in limbo after the resignation of Rahul Gandhi, party veteran Natwar Singh on Sunday joined the chorus backing Priyanka Gandhi Vadra for the top post, adding that having a non-Gandhi at the helm will cause the party to split.Praising Priyanka for her visit to Sonbhadra to meet victims of a firing incident, the former external affairs minister told ANI that she is capable of handling the party. "You must have witnessed what she did in a village in Uttar Pradesh. It was amazing. She stayed there and achieved what she wanted to," he said.Singh suggested that Rahul's decision of a having someone from outside the Gandhi family as the party chief will have to be reversed.On being asked if Priyanka would be elected as the party president, the Congressman said, "It will depend on Priyanka because her brother (Rahul Gandhi) had said that nobody from the Gandhi family will become the Congress president. Now, the family will have to reverse the decision and only they can do it."Earlier, Anil Shastri, son of former prime minister Lal Bahadur Shastri, had said that Priyanka Gandhi should be made the Congress president as no one other than her is "100 per cent acceptable".Shastri, speaking to ANI, had also warned that if somebody else is made the supremo and a section of the outfit does not accept them, chances are that the party will disintegrate.Natwar Singh echoed similar sentiments and said that if anyone is elected from outside the Gandhi family, the Congress will split within 24 hours."It is unfortunate that the country's 134-years-old party does not have a party president. I do not think apart from the Gandhi family, anyone should be elected as the president," Singh added.Around 50 days after Rahul stepped down as Congress president, taking moral responsibility for the humiliating defeat in the Lok Sabha elections, the grand old party is yet to finalize its new chief.Gandhi, now a lawmaker from Wayanad in Kerala, became the Congress president in 2017. He had, earlier this month, written a lengthy four-page letter making his resignation from the post public. Taking responsibility for the drubbing in Lok Sabha polls, Rahul had said it would not be right for him to suggest a successor.At present Congress in Goa has completely lost foot, after 10 of its MLAs switched side with the BJP. This has reduced its strength to five in the Assembly.Similarly, in Karnataka, the situation is equally embarrassing for the party, as its coalition government with JD(S) is facing a tough time. The government had slumped into a crisis following the resignation of 16 dissident MLAs and now its survival seems to be tough.The Congress won 52 seats in the recent general elections, which is just eight more than its 2014 Lok Sabha tally of 44.

Umpire who gave England 6 overthrows in WC final admits it was a mistake
Umpire Kumar Dharmasena has admitted that awarding England six overthrows instead of five in final over of 2019 World Cup final was a mistake. "I agree...there was a judgmental error when I see it on TV replays now. But we didn't have luxury of TV replays at the ground," he said. He further said that he'll never regret the decision.
https://www.crictracker.com/i-will-never-regret-the-decision-i-made-says-kumar-dharmasena-on-the-controversial-overthrow-in-the-world-cup-final/
CricTracker
It’s been a week since the 2019 World Cup final has finished but many are still busy discussing the game. Undoubtedly, it was the best ODI game ever played and irrespective of the result, both England and New Zealand should be proud of themselves for the effort they put in. But some crunch moments decided the game eventually and one of them was the umpire Kumar Dharmasena awarding six runs to England in the last over of the chase when the ball ricocheted off Ben Stokes’ bat.
The incident took place in the final over when the home team needed nine runs off three balls and the Kiwis almost had the World Cup trophy in the bag. The batsman swatted the ball to deep mid-wicket and set off for two runs. While taking the second run, Stokes dived to avoid getting run-out only for his bat to deflect the ball to the boundary.

The on-field umpires consulted then to give England six runs when actually five runs should’ve signalled. According to the cricketing laws, the two batsmen should’ve crossed each other when the fielder threw the ball and Stokes and Adil Rashid hadn’t crossed when Martin Guptill fired in a throw. It was considered as a clear mistake by the former international umpire Simon Taufel.
Speaking about the controversial call to a Sri Lankan publication the Sunday Times, Kumar Dharmasena has cleared that he has no regrets about the decision he made regarding the overthrow. However, he also admitted that they made a judgemental error in the middle.
“It’s easy for people to comment after seeing TV replays. I agree that there was a judgmental error when I see it on TV replays now. But we did not have the luxury of TV replays at the ground and I will never regret the decision I made. Besides, the ICC praised me for the decision I made at that time,” he said.
Dharmasena also cleared that he communicated to the leg umpire Marais Erasmus before making the decision and even the other umpires agreed to give six runs to England. “There is no provision in the law to refer this to the third umpire as no dismissal was involved. So, I did consult the leg umpire through the communication system which is heard by all other umpires and the match referee.
“And, while they cannot check TV replays, they all confirmed that the batsmen have completed the run. This is when I made my decision,” the 48-year-old added.
