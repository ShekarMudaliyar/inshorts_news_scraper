MSK Prasad reveals why Rayudu wasn't picked after injuries to players
Chief selector MSK Prasad has revealed that injured opener Shikhar Dhawan was replaced by Rishabh Pant instead of Ambati Rayudu during 2019 World Cup as the team already had a reserve opener in KL Rahul and required a left-hander. He added that when all-rounder Vijay Shankar was injured, they called in Mayank Agarwal as the team needed a back-up opener.

Indian cricket team chief selector MSK Prasad stated that there was no confusion when it comes to replacing injured players during the recently concluded ICC World Cup 2019. Prasad also added the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) missed putting a release on the website regarding the replacements. A lot of questions were raised when Rishabh Pant was brought in as replacement for the injured opener Shikhar Dhawan and .KL Rahul, who batted at No. 4 in the first two matches, was promoted to open the batting with Vijay Shankar at No. 4. After Shankar sustained a toe injury, he was eventually replaced with a reserve opener in Mayank Agarwal.

However, Prasad justified their actions during the announcement of the squads for the tour of West Indies.
“With regards to the selection, there is a policy that in between the series or mega events like the World Cup, I don’t take press conferences which has led to a lot of speculation,” Prasad said on Sunday.
“When Shikhar Dhawan was injured, we already had a reserve opener in KL Rahul. At that juncture, we didn’t have a left-hander at the top. The team management requested for a lefthander. We had no other choice other than Rishabh Pant. We knew his capability. That’s the reason why we had to bring in a left-hander.

Seniors purposely didn't perform, laughed after defeats: Naib
All-rounder Gulbadin Naib, who was Afghanistan's captain in 2019 World Cup, has claimed that his team's senior players didn't perform deliberately in the tournament. "They weren't giving attention to me. They laughed instead of being sad after defeats and didn't even look at me when asked to bowl," he added. Notably, Naib was removed from captaincy after the World Cup.

Afghanistan endured an extremely tough time at the 2019 World Cup. They lost all nine matches at the competition despite coming extremely close to victory on as many as three occasions. Their captain Gulbadin Naib looked a bit out of ideas at times and was unable to handle the pressure and after the tournament, has been sacked from the helm. He has now made some serious allegations against the senior cricketers in the team stating that they didn’t support him during the tough times.
Afghanistan were found wanting in demanding conditions against the teams like England, Australia, New Zealand and others. But they fared really well against their Asian neighbours and dragged India extremely close losing the game by only 11 runs. Their encounter against Pakistan went down to the wire and at one stage, were the favourites to win the match.

But the team, especially Gulbadin Naib, crumbled under pressure and Imad Wasim and Wahab Riaz took Pakistan home in a tense chase.
Gulbadin Naib was made the captain of the team just ahead of the World Cup and even the players like Mohammad Nabi and Rashid Khan had expressed their disappointment over the same. While the skipper never came out with controversial statements during the tournament, he has now accused some of the senior cricketers that they were not playing well deliberately.
He also claimed that they didn’t support him on the field whenever he used to ask them to bowl at times. “We depend mostly on seniors in the World Cup but they were deliberately not performing, not giving attention to me, they were laughing instead of being sad after defeats & even not looking at me when asked to bowl,” Naib was quoted as saying by Afghanistan journalist.

Gulbadin Naib has been sacked from captaincy now and Rashid Khan has been appointed the captain of the team across all the formats. He has assured the leg-spinner of all the required support and Rashid acknowledged the same in a tweet recently.

Dhoni still fit enough to play international cricket: Childhood coach
Reacting to the speculation around MS Dhoni's retirement, the former India captain's childhood coach Keshav Banerjee said, "Dhoni still has cricket left in him. I know that. He is still fit enough to play international cricket." "I feel they (selectors) should talk to Dhoni and make things clear...To me, he had a good World Cup and looked sharp," he added.

Hindustan Times
MS Dhoni is still fit to continue and if the Indian team wants the best out of him, the selectors should think of managing his workload properly, feels the former India captain’s childhood coach Keshav Banerjee.
The mystery surrounding Dhoni’s future was put to rest temporarily on Saturday after he decided to take a two-month break and serve his army regiment after a gruelling India Premier League season and the 2019 World Cup. It is no secret that Dhoni had already made himself unavailable for the tour of West Indies, but he has now informed the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) that he is joining the Parachute Regiment of the Territorial Army.
“Dhoni still has cricket left in him. I know that. He is still fit enough to play international cricket,” Banerjee told IANS.

Since the end of the World Cup where India lost in the semi-finals to New Zealand, talks have been rife about Dhoni’s retirement with selectors also reportedly not keen on assuring the 2007 World T20 and 2011 World Cup winning captain a place in the playing XI.
“I feel they (selectors) should talk to Dhoni and make things clear,” Banerjee said. “I know Dhoni very well since he was a boy. Not even his best friend would know when he will retire. So I really have no idea. But he looks fit as ever and is enjoying his game. To me, he had a good World Cup and looked sharp.”

Asked about youngsters like Rishabh Pant waiting in the wings, and whether Dhoni should make way for them, Banerjee opined: “He (Pant) needs guidance and who better than Dhoni to guide him. It is my personal opinion. I don’t know what BCCI will do. But if you ask me, they should manage Dhoni well from here on if they want him in the T20 World Cup as well. Dhoni does not need to play every series. That’s how Rishabh Pant can also fit in.”

Grey sales of high-end phones causing ₹2,500 cr revenue loss: ICEA
The sale of high-end mobile phones in the grey market is causing an estimated loss of ₹2,500 crore annually, mobile industry body India Cellular and Electronics Association (ICEA) has claimed. It suggested imposing a maximum customs duty of ₹4,000 on handsets priced above ₹20,000 to stop the practice. Currently, a basic customs duty of 20% is imposed on imported handsets.
https://www.financialexpress.com/industry/grey-sales-of-high-end-phones-causing-revenue-loss-of-rs-2500-crore-icea/1651427/?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts
The Financial Express
Sale of high-end mobile phones in the grey market is causing an estimated loss of Rs 2,500 crore annually to the exchequer, mobile industry body India Cellular and Electronics Association has claimed. The industry body has suggested imposing a maximum customs duty of Rs 4,000 on handsets priced above Rs 20,000 to discourage duty evasion and wipe out the premium for illegal sales. A basic customs duty (BCD) of 20 per cent is imposed on imported handsets at present.
“High-end phones that are getting sold in the grey market are estimated to cause a loss of Rs 2,500 crore annually on account of non-payment of basic customs duty (BCD) and also goods and services tax,” India Cellular and Electronics Association (ICEA) Chairman Pankaj Mohindroo told PTI.
The industry body has requested Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman that the BCD of 20 per cent should continue but with a cap of Rs 4,000 on mobile phones priced above Rs 20,000, Mohindroo said. The step will wipe out high margins on the illegal sale of high-end handsets and give a boost to legal imports, the ICEA has reasoned.
“Revenue impact on this would be an additional duty of Rs 700 crore of BCD approximately, which will get netted off because of the reduction in duty on the legal import. Hence, there will be no net gain or net loss. The GST collection will, however, go up by over Rs 1,000 crore and the market environment will become much cleaner and regularised,” Mohindroo said.
The ICEA said that recent budget was focussed on promoting electronics manufacturing in the country with a provision to write off capital expenditure for under section of 35 AD of Income Tax act.
“The entire mobile phone and its components manufacturing ecosystem should be brought under the finally notified scheme,” he said.The industry body has requested the government to bring down GST on mobile phone parts to 12 per cent from 18 per cent at present as it is creating an inverted duty structure in the sector.
The GST on mobile phones is 12 per cent while 18 per cent on parts such as back covers, batteries, headphones etc. Mohindroo said that the inverted duty structure has led to a serious cash flow issue for manufacturers and is adversely impacting the competitiveness of locally-produced mobile phones.
India had two mobile phone factories in 2014 but now, it has 268 factories engaged in the manufacturing of mobile phones and their accessories. Prime Minister Narendra Modi during his 13th India-Japan annual summit had announced making India top mobile phone manufacturing destination.
Though there is a mechanism in GST to provide a refund of input tax credit (ITC), there is no way to provide a refund of accumulated ITC on the GST paid on capital goods and services in case of inverted structure. “All new manufacturers are investing heavily on Capex (capital expenditure) and business promotion for creating a brand image. GST on such expense is an additional cost to the manufacturer, as they are not allowed refund of such accumulated credit,” Mohindroo said.
The ICEA has urged the finance minister to reduce timeframe for refund of GST credits to at most a week. The industry body has also demanded input credit on manufacturing plant or shed, and canteen service, among others.

Bengali actress Rimjhim Mitra, two others join BJP
Bengali film and television actress Rimjhim Mitra and two others joined the BJP in the presence of state BJP President Dilip Ghosh. Mitra said that it's the first time she is "openly supporting" a party as she felt "cornered" working under the "monopolistic approach" in the Bengali film and TV industry. On July 18, several Bengali actors joined the party.

Kolkata: Three days after 12 Bengali actors joined the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), film and television actress Rimjhim Mitra on Sunday became a part of the party. Actor Surojit Choudhury and model Pamela Goswami also followed suit.
Notably, Rimjhim is a popular TV actress who won ‘Jhalak Dikhla Jaa Bangla’ in 2013 and was also seen in Bigg Boss Bangla. She also made her mark in films, like ‘Teen Yaari Katha’ and ‘Cross Connection’.
“I am not happy working under the monopolistic approach in the Bengali film and TV industry. I have felt cornered many times and this is the first time I am openly talking about supporting a party. I have joined the BJP as I found it welcoming,” Rimjhim said after she was handed the BJP flag by its state President Dilip Ghosh.
On July 18, 12 Bengali actors, including Parno Mittra, joined the BJP. The actors had joined the party in the presence of state BJP chief Dilip Ghosh and senior leader Mukul Roy in Delhi. Film and TV personalities Rishi Kaushik, Kanchana Moitra, Rupanjana Mitra, Parno and Biswajit Ganguly were among the dozen of celebrities who cast their lot with the BJP at its Delhi headquarters.
On Saturday, Mukul Roy had claimed that as many as 107 CPM, Congress and TMC MLAs will be joining the BJP. “107 West Bengal MLAs from CPM, Congress and TMC will join BJP. We have their list prepared and they are in contact with us,” Roy had said.
Right after the Lok Sabha election results were announced, Banerjee suffered a jolt as two of her party’s MLAs and over 50 councillors joined hands with the BJP.
