The much-admired Dutch actor got his first break in 1969 when he was cast in a historical Dutch television series called ""Floris"" directed by the then little known Paul Verhoeven. It triggered a years-long collaboration between the two, although it was said they fell out in the mid-80s.Verhoeven cast Hauer in his first major film role in ""Turkish Delight"" in 1973. But it was when Hauer was teamed up with Hollywood star Sylvester Stallone in the 1981 thriller ""Nighthawks"" that he first came to the attention of US audiences.The following year he appeared as Batty, model number N6MAA10816, the leader of the renegade Nexus-6 replicants in ""Blade Runner"" which made him one of Hollywood's film icons.Speaking about Hauer's death, Verhoeven told the Dutch ANP news wire: ""I have lost my alter ego.

4,This is ghar wapsi: BJP MLA after voting in favour of MP govt,"After BJP MLAs Narayan Tripathi and Sharad Kaul voted in favour of a legislation backed by the Congress government in Madhya Pradesh Assembly, Tripathi said, ""This is my ghar wapsi (homecoming)."" Both the BJP MLAs are former Congress leaders. This comes after BJP MLA Gopal Bhargava said the Congress government won't last 24 hours if BJP's top leadership ordered so.",Hindustan Times,"Two BJP lawmakers stunned their party on Wednesday when they extended support to an amendment to the criminal procedure code in the Madhya Pradesh assembly. “This is my ghar wapsi (homecoming),” one of the two MLAs, Narayan Tripathi, announced soon after.Tripathi, who had been a Congress legislator, had switched over to the BJP in 2014. The legislator claimed that the second BJP MLA to support the Kamal Nath government’s bill is Sharad Kol.The two bonus votes for the Congress-led coalition government came hours after a back and forth between chief minister Kamal Nath and the leader of opposition in the assembly Gopal Bhargava over the stability of the coalition.The BJP’s Gopal Bhargava, speaking against the backdrop of the collapse of the HD Kumaraswamy government in Karnataka, had claimed that the opposition could pull down the Kamal Nath government at any time. The only reason that the Congress-led coalition had survived was because he hadn’t received his orders from the party leadership in Delhi.Nath shot back, pointing that this was probably because the party’s top two bosses were “wiser” than he was. He also dared Bhargava to try a no confidence motion against the government if he was so inclined.The extra vote from the two BJP lawmakers came soon after.The amendment to the criminal procedure code was supported by 122 MLAs though the state’s ruling coalition only has the support of 120 MLAs (excluding the speaker). Narayan Tripathi came out in the open soon after. He spoke about how there had been efforts to sabotage his election from within the BJP and how the last Shivraj Chouhan government only made announcements but didn’t deliver. “During the then BJP government, there were only assurances but no development work was done in my constituency Maihar,” he told reporters.The BJP’s Gopal Bhargava, who was taken aback by the outcome, initially tried to suggest that the party hadn’t issued a whip against the bill and so, the vote really didn’t matter. But the BJP, which has 108 MLAs in the assembly, hadn’t participated in the vote. “We have to see what transpired between them,” he said, when asked about the defection by the MLA.",https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-madhya-pradesh-2-bjp-lawmakers-vote-for-kamal-nath-govt-s-bill/story-t2f14YgVIjl17q2FMdSX5N.html?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

8,Priti Patel becomes Britain's 1st Indian-origin Home Secretary,"Priti Patel on Wednesday took charge as Britain's first Indian-origin Home Secretary in the newly unveiled Boris Johnson-led Cabinet. The 47-year-old has replaced Pakistani-origin Sajid Javid, who has been moved to the Treasury department as the first ethnic minority Chancellor of the Exchequer. Patel previously served as Secretary of State for International Development, but was forced to resign in 2017.",The Financial Express,"Priti Patel, an ardent Brexiteer who was among the most vocal critics of Theresa May’s Brexit strategy, took charge as Britain’s first Indian-origin home secretary as part of Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s top team on Thursday.She replaces Pakistani-origin Sajid Javid, who moves to the Treasury department as the first ethnic minority Chancellor of the Exchequer.“I will do everything in my power to keep our country safe, our people secure, and also to fight the scourge of crime that we see on our streets. I look forward to the challenges that now lie ahead,” Patel said, in reference to her new job at the helm of the UK Home Office.Patel had been a prominent member of the “Back Boris” campaign for the Conservative Party leadership and was widely tipped for the plum post in the prime minister’s frontline team.“It is important that the cabinet should represent modern Britain as well as a modern Conservative Party,” she said, hours before her appointment was announced on Wednesday.A long-standing Eurosceptic, Patel had steered the “Vote Leave” campaign in the lead-up to the June, 2016 referendum in favour of Britain’s exit from the European Union (EU).The 47-year-old was first elected as a Conservative MP for Witham in Essex in 2010 and gained prominence in the then David Cameron-led Tory government as his Indian Diaspora Champion.She went on to be appointed to junior ministerial posts, treasury minister in 2014 and then employment minister after the 2015 general election, before May promoted her to the position of secretary of state in the Department for International Development (DfID) in 2016, until she was forced to quit the post in 2017.“With Boris Johnson leading the Conservative Party and as prime minister, the United Kingdom will have a leader who believes in Britain, will implement a new vision for the future of the country and a roadmap to move forward and thrive as a self-governing nation that re-establishes our ties with our friends and allies around the world such as India,” Patel told PTI after Johnson secured a landslide victory in the Tory leadership contest earlier this week.“He is committed to securing new and improved trading relationship with our friends in India and ensuring that the values we share — the rule of law, democracy, and dynamic entrepreneurial spirit — should be at the heart of one of our most important partners on the global stage,” Patel, who has been a champion of India-UK ties ever since her time as Indian Diaspora Champion, said.The Gujarati-origin politician, who is a prominent guest at all major Indian diaspora events in the UK, is seen as an avid supporter of Prime Minister Narendra Modi in the UK.As a member of the UK Parliament’s influential Foreign Affairs Committee (FAC), she was part of the team that recently released its damning report warning that the UK was falling behind in the race to engage with India at the end of a lengthy Global Britain and India parliamentary inquiry.“Our report calls for the government to look again at the relationship between the UK and India,” Patel said, in reference to the “Building Bridges: Reawakening UK-India ties” report released last month to mark the first-ever India Day in the UK Parliament.“This should be a special relationship based upon the living bridge between our two great countries and a partnership we should be nurturing. The report covers many of the missed opportunities where the UK should be proactively and bilaterally enhancing our ties. We are soon to have a new PM in the UK, which will provide a welcome change in how we engage with India’s re-elected PM Modi,” she said at the time.Patel once again returns as the seniormost British Indian member of the UK cabinet, having been forced to resign in November, 2017 as International Development secretary amid a scandal over allegedly failing to disclose meetings with officials in Israel without informing the UK Foreign Office.She had maintained that it was a private visit and Johnson, then the UK foreign secretary, spoke out to back her.Describing Patel as a “good friend” with whom he worked closely together for Global Britain, he had said it was “quite right that she meets with people and organisations overseas”.But Patel was effectively sacked by May, forcing her to the Parliament backbenches, from where she continued to voice her criticism of May’s Brexit plan.She was among the rebel Tory MPs who consistently voted against the former prime minister’s Withdrawal Agreement with the EU as a “bad deal for Britain”, which ultimately sealed May’s term at the top post.Get live Stock Prices from BSE and NSE and latest NAV, portfolio of Mutual Funds, calculate your tax by Income Tax Calculator, know market’s Top Gainers, Top Losers & Best Equity Funds.

9,India may launch $10-billion global bond sale in October,"India is reportedly considering an option to raise $10 billion in one go from its first overseas bond sale in October. The government would prefer to sell yen or euro-denominated debt so as to offer lower yields, reports added. Former RBI Governor Raghuram Rajan recently warned that India's plan to issue bonds overseas has enormous risks but no real benefit.",Livemint,"India’s maiden overseas bond sale couldn’t have come at a better time with yields tumbling globally. The country is considering an option to raise $10 billion in one go from its first overseas bond sale as early as October, according to people with knowledge of the matter.The issuance of sovereign notes by Asia’s third-biggest economy is expected to price at a yield premium of about 90 basis points to 130 points over US Treasuries, according to a Bloomberg survey of foreign and local investors. That’s in line with sales by countries with similar credit ratings such as Indonesia. The novelty of a debut offering may also support demand for India’s debt, analysts say.India’s overall budget deficit is one of the highest in Asia, but that may not deter bond buyers desperate for extra returns at a time when about $13 trillion of global fixed-income assets, or around a quarter of the total, have negative yields. The deal will give global funds more access to Indian sovereign bonds, and may also let the country’s other issuers adjust debt sale prices based on the offshore sovereign bond as a benchmark.“We think an Indian sovereign Eurobond issue would be very well received in today’s markets,"" said Gregory Smith, fixed-income strategist at Renaissance Capital in London. “With US 10-year Treasuries yielding close to 2%, the search for yield continues, plus foreign investors would be looking to realize long-sought-after exposure to the Indian economy.""India’s debt sale would follow a slew of sovereign issuance by emerging market countries this year. Indonesia sold 3.4% bonds due 2029 at 130.50 basis points over Treasuries in June, while the Philippines issued 10-year notes at 110 basis points in January. Russia sold 2029 dollar bonds at a 3.95% yield, and Saudi Arabia issued 2 billion euros of bonds due in 2039 at 140 basis points over mid-swaps.“The very low and even negative yields in developed markets are indirectly positive for EM bonds,"" and that’s likely to result in strong demand for India’s sovereign offering, said Jan Dehn, the London-based head of research at Ashmore Group Plc. India “continues to place barriers to foreign investors in the domestic bond market, so dollar bonds are a second-best way to express a view,"" he said.The South Asian nation’s regulators have capped holdings of sovereign debt by overseas investors, who are allowed to own only about 6% of total outstanding bonds, while peers like Indonesia and South Korea have no restrictions.The announcement of the foreign-bond sale by the country’s finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman in the 5 July budget helped boost onshore sovereign notes as investors cheered the opening of a new avenue for the country to raise funds. The yield on benchmark 10-year bonds declined to the lowest in 2 1/2 years before paring some gains to trade at 6.46% on Wednesday.But the proposed issuance has also come under scrutiny, with former central bankers and some independent economists criticizing the move, saying India’s general budget deficit and a wider current-account deficit could make the nation vulnerable during episodes of global swings.The combined budget deficit of federal and state governments and state-run firms is about 8% of the gross domestic product. While the gap and growing stresses in the banking system are an area of concern, BNP Paribas Asset Management says Indian assets may still see good demand. “Sentiment has been improving lately, and, India credit metrics are overall good and improving. So the issuance should attract interest from all institutional investors,"" said Jean-Charles Sambor, London-based deputy head of emerging-market fixed income at BNP Paribas Asset Management.This story has been published from a wire agency feed without modifications to the text.
