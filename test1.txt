I am sure my dog won't be too angry at me: Boult on WC final defeat
New Zealand pacer Trent Boult, who bowled the final over and Super Over in 2019 World Cup final, said he'll walk his dog along the beach to cope with the defeat. "I'm sure my dog won't be too angry at me," he added. "[The defeat] is...going to be hard to swallow for next couple of years," he further said.

New Zealand pacer Trent Boult’s plans of getting over the gut-wrenching World Cup loss to England include walking his dog along the beach but he concedes that losing the trophy on boundary-count will be hard to swallow for at least a couple of years.    
Boult, who claimed 17 wickets in the showpiece and was among the star performers for the runner-ups, landed back in the country amid questions on how the Black Caps are coping after losing their second successive World Cup final.
 “Well, I’m gonna go home for the first time in about four months. Probably gonna walk my dog along the beach and try and put it aside. I’m sure he won’t be too angry at me,” Boult told reporters.

 “...it’s not gonna be something that disappears in the next couple of days. It’s probably something that’s gonna be hard to swallow for the next couple of years,” he said.    In the pulsating match on Sunday, being called the greatest World Cup final by many, the Kiwis tied the regulation 50 overs and the super over but went down on inferior boundary count.
 Boult said he has been struggling to forget the 49th over in which he took a catch of Ben Stokes off Jimmy Neesham but ended up stepping on the boundary to let the advantage slip.
 “I suppose it’s just natural to nitpick and pull apart a game like that,” he said.

 “...you just wonder those little kind of things that went your way, or didn’t go your way or whatever, it could’ve been a totally different game. Yeah, of course, I’m living the last over throughout my mind a lot.
 “Somehow we were hit for six along the ground which has never been happened before. And then, yeah, couple of run outs, to bowl them out and to see the scores level and to lose was a pretty unique situation,” he recalled.    Does he feel cheated? The answer is a firm “no.”   Asked if he would he do anything differently, Boult said he doesn’t envision another team coming as close to winning or losing the Cup like his side did.
 “It was an amazing stage to be on. Obviously saw what it meant for the Englishmen to get across the line. It could have been us. Unfortunately it wasn’t. No one is probably going to get closer to winning the World Cup or losing the World Cup as us,” said the 29-year-old.
 Exuding humility like his captain Kane Williamson, Boult said he felt apologetic towards fans who were rooting for the quintessential “nice guys” of the game.    
“You see a lot of disappointment in cricketing fans around the world, not just Kiwis but a lot of supporters that wanted us to win. It’s a shame to let everyone down really.
 “It’s hard to know that after playing 15 hours… A lot of Kiwis out there were saying ‘we felt for you’ kind of thing. Yeah don’t really know too much more to say really. Obviously we’re all hurting and yeah sorry for letting everyone down,” he said.    Recalling the 2015 final, in which the Black Caps were outplayed by Australia, Boult that loss hurts less compared to the heartbreak at Lord’s.

Neesham's childhood coach died during World Cup final Super Over
New Zealand all-rounder Jimmy Neesham's childhood coach David James Gordon passed away during the 2019 World Cup final Super Over. The former Auckland Grammar School teacher breathed his last, moments after the cricketer hit a six on the bowling of England's Jofra Archer. "How appropriate you held on until just after such a match. Hope you were proud," Neesham tweeted.

CricTracker
England and New Zealand played out the most thrilling World Cup final ever at Lord’s on July 14. Both the teams scored 241 runs in their allotted 50 overs and the match went to the super over. They scored the same number of runs in the super over as well only for the hosts to pip the opponents on the boundary count and win the trophy for the first time. The Kiwis were hard done with the absurd rules and their fans were in shock back home on Monday morning.
Jimmy Neesham was in the middle of the action in the super over and the southpaw had given a realistic chance for his team by hitting a six off Jofra Archer early. However, at the same time, the cricketer’s high school teacher Dave Gordon was battling with life and took his last breath after Neesham smacked a six in the super over.

“One of the nurses came in for the final over, the super over, and she said his breathing is changing. You know, I think Jimmy Neesham had just hit that six and he took his last breath,” Gordon’s daughter Leonie Gordon was quoted as saying by stuff.co.nz.
Jimmy Neesham who was heartbroken after the World Cup final and put up a series of tweets in disappointments also paid tribute to his teacher on social media. “Dave Gordon, my High School teacher, coach and friend. Your love of this game was infectious, especially for those of us lucky enough to play under you. How appropriate you held on until just after such a match. Hope you were proud. Thanks for everything. RIP,” Neesham’s tweet read.

Leonie Gordon was also heartened to see Neesham’s tribute and said, “It was lovely, you know, he’s kept in touch with Jimmy and he is friends with Jimmy’s father. He always had a soft spot for Jimmy Neesham, he was very proud of him. He would definitely be following his career,” she further said.
Dave Gordon taught at Auckland Grammar for as many as 25 years where he coached a few young New Zealand cricketers as well and Lockie Ferguson was also one of his students.

The Financial Express
The Income-Tax Department has attached a ‘benami’ plot worth Rs 400 crore in Noida belonging to BSP supremo Mayawati’s brother and his wife, an official order said. The provisional order for the attachment of the seven-acre plot, “beneficially owned” by Anand Kumar and his wife Vichiter Lata, was issued on July 16 by the Delhi-based Benami Prohibition Unit (BPU) of the department. Mayawati recently appointed Kumar as national vice president of the Bahujan Samaj Party.
The order, accessed by PTI, has been issued under section 24(3) of the Prohibition of Benami Property Transactions Act, 1988. The attached asset, considered a ‘benami’ property of Kumar and his wife by the department, measures 28,328.07 square meters or about seven acres, the order said. The book value of the property is Rs 400 crore, it said.

The law stipulates that a violator of the Benami Act can face rigorous imprisonment up to seven years besides being liable to pay fine up to 25 per cent of fair market value of the ‘benami’ property. The department started initiating action under the new Benami Transactions (Prohibition) Amendment Act, 2016 from November 1, 2016 after the Modi government enforced the dormant-lying law from that year. The I-T Department is the nodal department to enforce the Benami Act in the country.

US removes Turkey from F-35 programme as it buys Russia's S-400
The US has removed Turkey from its F-35 fighter jets programme after it received the first parts of the Russian S-400 air defence system. "The F-35 cannot coexist with a Russian intelligence collection platform that will be used to learn about its advanced capabilities," the White House said. The US had earlier stopped training Turkish pilots on F-35 jets.

Reuters
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States said on Wednesday that it was removing Turkey from the F-35 fighter jet program, a move that had been long threatened and expected after Ankara began accepting delivery of an advanced Russian missile defense system last week. 
The first parts of the S-400 air defense system were flown to the Murted military air base northwest of Ankara on Friday, sealing Turkey’s deal with Russia, which Washington had struggled for months to prevent. 
“The U.S. and other F-35 partners are aligned in this decision to suspend Turkey from the program and initiate the process to formally remove Turkey from the program,” said Ellen Lord, the under secretary of defense for acquisition and sustainment. 
“The United States is spending between $500 and $600 million in non-recurring engineering in order to shift the supply chain,” she said. 
Used by NATO and other U.S. allies, the F-35 stealth fighter jet is the world’s most advanced jet fighter. Washington is concerned that deploying the S-400 with the F-35 would allow Russia to gain too much inside information of the stealth system. 
“The F-35 cannot coexist with a Russian intelligence collection platform that will be used to learn about its advanced capabilities,” the White House said in a statement earlier on Wednesday. 
Washington has long said the acquisition may lead to Turkey’s expulsion from the F-35 program. 
The Pentagon had already laid out a plan to remove Turkey from the program, including halting any new training for Turkish pilots on the advanced aircraft. 
“The situation with Turkey is a government-to-government matter and we’ll comply with any guidance issued by the United States Government,” said a spokesperson for Lockheed Martin Corp (LMT.N), the prime contractor on the jet.

Google removes 7 Play Store apps over risk of spying on user
Google has removed seven apps from Play Store over risks of their ability to track user location and access contacts, SMS and call history. The apps were detected by antivirus firm Avast, which claimed all of the seven apps were likely designed by a Russian developer. The apps have been installed a combined 1.3 lakh times, Avast said.
https://www.livemint.com/technology/apps/google-removes-seven-stalker-apps-that-may-have-spied-on-you-1563425716069.html?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

New Delhi: Google has removed seven stalker apps that were available on its Play Store as apps for children's safety or finding stolen phones but were being used to stalk employees, romantic partners or kids.
The apps were able to track the surveilled person's location, collect their contacts, SMS and call history.
Mobile threat researchers at anti-virus company Avast detected the apps on Google Play Store that were all likely designed by a Russian developer.
Avast reported these apps to Google which then removed them from the Play Store.
The apps have been installed a combined 130,000 times, with the most-installed apps being Spy Tracker, and SMS Tracker, both with more than 50,000 installs.
"These apps are highly unethical and problematic for people's privacy and shouldn't be on the Google Play Store," Nikolaos Chrysaidos, Avast's head of mobile threat intelligence and security, said in a statement on Wednesday.
"They promote criminal behaviour, and can be abused by employers, stalkers or abusive partners to spy on their victims. We classify such apps as stalkerware," he added.
It's hard to tell if your device has stalkerware installed on it as you will not see an app icon on your smartphone.
The apps require the person to have access to the phone they want to spy on. The person can download the apps from the Google Play Store and install them on the target device.
The app then prompts the person who installed the app to enter their email address and password. The spying app is sent there.
"Upon setup, there is no app icon, so the targeted person does not see any sign of the stalkerware app installed on their phone," said Avast.
For example, the description of "Spy Tracker" app on Google Play read: "Find out more about your child's life, interests, friends and plans. Parents are responsible for every step that their kids make. So this app is created to monitor them and protect them from dangers that can be revealed via cell phone."
According to SMS Tracker, "our app will help you monitor work time of your employees to save time and save money. Notify the users of work phones that you are going to install the app. It will teach your employees to use their time at work wisely, to reduce time spent on messengers and arrive to work in time".
In April, Russian cyber security company Kaspersky Lab said it would start flagging stalkerware as malicious. In 2018, it detected stalkerware on 58,487 mobile devices.

ANI
New Delhi [India], July 18 (ANI): Union Minister Gen (retired) VK Singh on Thursday hailed the Kulbhushan Jadhav verdict and asserted that the positive judgment may make Pakistan realize their mistake.Speaking to ANI on the International Court of Justice's verdict delivered yesterday, Singh said, "The judgement is positive. With a judgment of 15:1 they have supported what we have said. It is visible that ICJ has honoured the basic conventions of law and justice and India has been successful in its mission".On being asked about whether India will further exhort more pressure on Pakistan for resolution of this issue, he said, "The way they had abducted Kulbhushan and filed a fake case, we believe something must be done about it. Hopefully, Pakistan will realise the mistake that they have made and will take action to ensure that Kulbhushan Jadhav gets justice and is returned to India. "His reaction comes after the ICJ on Wednesday continued its stay on the execution of the Indian national Kulbhushan Jadhav, held in a Pakistani jail on allegations of spying, and called for an effective review and reconsideration of the conviction.Jadhav, 49, was purportedly "arrested" from Balochistan by Pakistani security forces on March 3, 2016, after he allegedly entered the country from Iran, as claimed by Islamabad.India has held that Pakistan, which faces several problems on its border with Iran, has been using Jadhav's case to blame India for its problems in Balochistan. It has used proxy groups such as Jaish al Adl against Iran, while Iranian officials have spoken of Pakistan's sponsorship of terror activities along the Iran-Pakistan border.It was on March 25, 2016, that then Foreign Secretary of Pakistan, Aizaz Ahmad Chaudhry, had informed the Indian High Commissioner in Islamabad of Jadhav's "arrest."Since then, Pakistan has not offered any explanation as to why Islamabad took over three weeks to inform the Indian High Commissioner about Jadhav's arrest.Jadhav was sentenced to death by a Pakistani military court on April 11, 2017.Following this, India on May 8, 2017, approached the ICJ against Pakistan "for egregious violations of the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations, 1963" in the matter.India alleged that Pakistan is in breach of Article 36(1) (b) of the Vienna Convention, which obliged Pakistan to inform India of the arrest of Jadhav "without delay".

The only dissenting voice in the 16-member world court on most counts was ad-hoc judge Tassaduq Hussain Gillani, 69, a former chief justice of Pakistan.
Judge Gillani concurred with his fellow judges on only one point: That the ICJ, variously also referred to as the UN court or world court, has jurisdiction to hear India’s plea against Pakistan over Kulbhushan Jadhav.

3. The world court concluded that Pakistan had breached its obligations under the Vienna convention by not informing India about the arrest “without delay”. Pakistan had taken nearly three weeks to inform New Delhi about Kulbhushan Jadhav’s arrest.
4. The UN court concluded that Pakistan deprived India of the right to communicate with and have access to Mr Kulbhushan Sudhir Jadhav, to visit him in detention and to arrange for his legal representation. Accordingly, the judges concluded that Pakistan had breached the obligations incumbent upon it under Article 36, paragraph 1 (a) and (c), of the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations.
5. The ICJ ordered Pakistan “to provide, by the means of its own choosing, effective review and reconsideration of the conviction and sentence of Mr. Kulbhushan Sudhir Jadhav” as reparation for the breach of his rights.
6. The ICJ directed Pakistan to inform Kulbhushan Sudhir Jadhav without further delay of his rights and to provide Indian consular officers access to him in accordance with Article 36 of the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations.
7. The ICJ declared that “a continued stay of execution constitutes an indispensable condition for the effective review and reconsideration of the conviction and sentence of Mr. Kulbhushan Sudhir Jadhav”.

Prosecutors drop case accusing Spacey of sexually assaulting man
Prosecutors on Wednesday dropped a case accusing actor Kevin Spacey of groping an 18-year-old man at a bar in 2016 after the accuser refused to testify about a missing phone, which the defence said could prove Spacey's innocence. The man's mother alleged in 2017 that Spacey got her son drunk and sexually assaulted him. Spacey has faced several other accusations.
https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2019/jul/17/kevin-spacey-charges-dropped-sexual-assault-case-groping-teen-nantucket?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts
The Guardian
Prosecutors dropped a case Wednesday accusing Kevin Spacey of groping a young man at a resort island bar in 2016, after the accuser refused to testify about a missing cellphone the defense says contains information supporting the actor’s claims of innocence.
Spacey was charged with indecent assault and battery last year in the only criminal case that has been brought against the actor since his career collapsed amid a slew of sexual misconduct allegations. The two-time Oscar winner was among the earliest and biggest names to be ensnared in the #MeToo movement against sexual assault and harassment that swept across the entertainment and other industries.
Spacey denies groping the man, whose mother first went public with the allegations in 2017. A phone message seeking comment was left with Spacey’s lawyer.
The actor’s accuser was ordered to take the stand earlier this month after he said he lost the cellphone he used the night of the alleged groping. The defense said it needed the phone to recover deleted text messages it said would help Spacey’s case.
The man denied deleting messages or manipulating screenshots of conversations he provided to investigators. But when he was pressed by the defense about whether he knew that altering evidence is a crime, he invoked his fifth amendment right against self-incrimination, and the judge said his testimony would be stricken from the record.
The judge then questioned how prosecutors would be able to bring Spacey to trial if the accuser continued to refuse to testify, and prosecutors told the judge they needed time to decide how to proceed.
On Wednesday, the Cape and Island district attorney Michael O’Keefe said in court documents that they were dropping the charge “due to an unavailability of the complaining witness”.
Prosecutors said in an emailed statement that they met with the man and his lawyer Sunday and told him that if he wouldn’t testify in further proceedings, they couldn’t move forward with the case. The man “elected not to waive his right under the fifth amendment”, prosecutors said.
Prosecutors said they could further pursue the case and grant the accuser immunity but then they would need more than his uncorroborated testimony.
Furthermore, “a grant of immunity compromises the witness to a degree which, in a case where the credibility of the witness is paramount, makes the further prosecution untenable”, they said.
Mitchell Garabedian, a lawyer for the accuser, said in email that the man and his family “have shown an enormous amount of courage under difficult circumstances”. Garabedian said he had no further comment.
The hearing at which the accuser testified came days after the man abruptly dropped a lawsuit he had just recently filed against the actor that sought damages for “severe and permanent mental distress and emotional injuries”. The suit was dismissed “with prejudice”, meaning it cannot be refiled.
The man did not receive a settlement to drop the civil case, his mother said. His lawyer said he dropped it because he was emotionally overwhelmed and wanted only “one rollercoaster ride at a time” and so chose to focus on the criminal case.
The man’s mother, the former Boston TV anchor Heather Unruh, alleged in 2017 that Spacey got her son drunk and sexually assaulted him at the Club Car, a bar on Nantucket where the teen worked as a busboy.
The man told police he went over to talk to Spacey after his shift because he wanted to get a picture with the former House of Cards star. He said Spacey bought him several drinks and tried to persuade him to come home with him before unzipping the man’s pants and groping him for about three minutes.
Unruh’s son told police he tried to move Spacey’s hands, but the groping continued, and he didn’t know what to do because he didn’t want to get in trouble for drinking because he was underage. The man said he fled when Spacey went to the bathroom.
Shortly after Spacey was charged, he posted a video on YouTube in the voice of his House of Cards character who was killed off after the sexual misconduct allegations emerged, saying “I’m certainly not going to pay the price for the thing I didn’t do.” Spacey has faced several other accusations.
His first accuser, the actor Anthony Rapp, said Spacey climbed on top of him on a bed when Rapp was 14 and Spacey 26. Spacey said he did not remember such an encounter but apologized if the allegations were true.
The Associated Press does not typically name people who say they are the victims of sexual assault unless they identify themselves publicly. Rapp has; Unruh’s son has not.

Will withdraw resignation: Rebel K'taka MLA ahead of trust vote
Rebel Karnataka MLA and Congress leader Ramalinga Reddy has announced he would withdraw his resignation and vote in favour of Congress-JD(S) government in the state during the floor test on Thursday. Adding that he had been with the party for 45 years, Reddy said, "I had only resigned as an MLA but I never said I'd move away from Congress."

The News Minute
Veteran Congress leader and MLA from BTM Layout in Bengaluru Ramalinga Reddy on Wednesday evening announced that he would continue with the Congress party. It is also confirmed that Reddy has assured the Congress that he will vote in favour of the trust vote. Reddy, who was one among the rebel legislators, had tendered his resignation to the Speaker on July 6 along with 11 other MLAs.
In a statement to the media, Ramalinga Reddy said that after several rounds of talks with the Congress leaders and the high command, he had decided to stay with the Congress.
“Due to several occurrences within the Congress party, I had resigned on July 6, 2019 as the MLA of BTM Layout. I have never sought or demanded a ministerial post. I have been with the Congress party for the last 45 years and I have been an MLA seven times. I had only resigned as an MLA but I had never said I would move away from the Congress,” Ramalinga Reddy’s statement reads.
The veteran leader and former Home Minister of the state also said that he had received several pleas from party workers requesting him to withdraw his resignation. However, Reddy did not specify whether he would withdraw his resignation.
“I have received numerous letters and pleas from party workers who have asked me to withdraw my resignation. Several leaders from the party have also asked me to do the same. In light of these developments, I would like to say that I will continue with the Congress party,” the statement said.
Speaking to the media, Ramalinga Reddy said that he would not make any announcement about his resignation to the media and that he would first discuss it with the Speaker.
“I tendered my resignation to the Speaker. I will not talk about whether I am withdrawing my resignation or not. I will discuss it with the Speaker and then make an announcement,” Ramalinga Reddy added.
Unlike the other rebels who resigned and flew to Mumbai stay at Renaissance Hotel, Ramalinga Reddy had remained in Bengaluru and persisted that he was with the Congress party.
Currently Congress MLAs including Ramesh Jarkiholi (Gokak), Byrathi Basavaraj (KR Puram), ST Somashekhar (Yeshwanthpura), BC Patil (Hirekerur), Shivaram Hebbar (Yellapur), Prathapgouda Patil (Maski), MTB Nagaraj (Hoskote) and Mahesh Kumathalli (Athani) are in Mumbai’s Renaissance Hotel along with JD(S) MLAs K Gopalaiah (Mahalakshmi Layout), AH Vishwanath (Hunasuru) and Narayana Gowda (Krishanarajapete)
However, Congress rebels including Munirathna Naidu (RR Nagar), Roshan Baig (Shivajinagar), K Sudhakar (Chikkaballapura) and Anand Singh (Vijayanagara) have remained in Karnataka but have refused to withdraw their resignations.

Neil Armstrong's Apollo 11 spacesuit goes on display after 13 yrs
Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum in Washington has put the spacesuit worn by Neil Armstrong, the first man to step on Moon during the Apollo 11 mission, on display after 13 years. Armstrong's son Rick unveiled the display on July 16, marking the 50th anniversary of Apollo 11 mission's launch. Neil Armstrong had passed away on August 25, 2012.
https://in.reuters.com/article/us-space-exploration-moon-spacesuit/neil-armstrongs-apollo-11-spacesuit-unveiled-at-smithsonian-idINKCN1UB2GX?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&mlt_click=GPT-+BETAUS%2FUK%2FIN+Sponsorlogo_8_Extended+Headline+List_sec2-col1-m1_News&utm_source=inshorts
Reuters
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The spacesuit astronaut Neil Armstrong wore during his mission to the moon went on public display for the first time in 13 years on Tuesday, at the Smithsonian’s Air and Space Museum exactly 50 years to the day when Apollo 11 launched into space. 
Armstrong’s son Rick unveiled the suit along with U.S. Vice President Mike Pence who recalled how the country was deeply divided in the late 1960s but came together in pride when Armstrong became the first man to walk on the moon. 
Armstrong died on Aug. 12, 2012 in Cincinnati, Ohio. 
“On top of the contributions to science and human understanding, for that brief moment, the man who wore this suit, brought together our nation and the world,” Pence said.  
“Apollo 11 is the only event of the 20th century that stands a chance of being widely remembered in the 30th century,” said Pence said. “A thousand years from now, July 20, 1969 will likely be a date that will live on in the minds and imaginations of men and women, here on Earth, across our solar system, and beyond.” 
Armstrong’s suit was displayed for about 30 years at the Smithsonian before it was taken down in 2006 because curators were concerned about deterioration. 
For the past 13 years, the suit has been subject to extensive conservation work, which included interviews with the designers and creators of the spacesuit and research into the materials and products used. 
“The complexity of the suit ensured it could support human life in the harshest of environments: extreme heat and cold, radiation, micrometeorites and the threat of cuts from sharp rocks all had to be taken into consideration,” Ellen Stofan, the Washington museum’s director, said at the event.  
“As our curators note, these spacesuits were actually single-person spacecraft, but while they were designed to endure the punishment of a lunar walk, they weren’t designed to last half a century on display.” 
While the original boots worn by the Apollo 11 astronauts were left on the moon because of weight concerns, the Smithsonian does have the boots worn by astronauts on Apollo 17 which were brought back to Earth. 
Conservation work was funded by thousands of public donations. Additional funds have been raised to conserve the spacesuit of astronaut Michael Collins, who joined Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin on the Apollo 11 mission.

Not your fault, ICJ verdict given in English: Giriraj Singh mocks Pak
After Pakistan government called the International Court of Justice's verdict in Kulbhushan Jadhav case a 'Big win for Pakistan', Union Minister Giriraj Singh tweeted, "Not your fault...judgment delivered in English." The UN court on Wednesday delivered the verdict in favour of India and found Pakistan guilty of violating Vienna Convention, thereby staying the death penalty to Jadhav by Pakistan.

Times Now
New Delhi: Union minister Giriraj Singh on Wednesday took a low dig at the Pakistani delegation who had defended their stand on the Kulbhushan Jadhav case at the International Court of Justice in The Hague yesterday after the verdict was ruled in favour of India.
Taking to social media platform Twitter, the senior BJP leader responded to a tweet that was put out by the official twitter account of Pakistan government where they tweeted “Big win for Pakistan. India’s demand of release and repatriation of Kulbhushan Jadhav rejected by ICJ”, contrary to what India’s demand and eventual verdict by the ICJ was.
“Not your fault... judgement delivered in English,” Giriraj Singh said in a witty jibe at the Pakistan government.
The twitterati also joined Singh in taking digs at Pakistan, with several of them taking multiple potshots at the neighbouring country.
While one Twitter user said, “Bhai verdict English main hoga, in logo ko samjhane mein time lagega,” another said, “Besides being masters of terrorism, they are also masters of illiteracy. Can’t even read the judgement correctly. The same guys were openly claiming victory just a few hours before a humiliating surrender in Dacca in 1971.”
Another user said, “Terror Conditioned Brains in Pakistan think differently.”
The International Court of Justice yesterday ruled in favour of India and put a stay on Jadhav’s execution. The international judiciary also ordered Pakistan to review the trial that ordered the sentencing and asked the Islamic nation to provide Jadhav the consular access he deserves and ruled that by not providing it despite repeated requests, Pakistan violated the Vienna Convention.
"We expect Pakistan to do whatever it has to do including appropriate legislative measures to guarantee a fair trial. So Pakistan's conduct is under watch and if what they do is another farcical attempt, we will be back in the Court," India's counsel Harish Salve told reporters after the ICJ verdict.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi also welcomes the ICJ judgement on Wednesday and assured that the government of India will continue to work for the safety and welfare of every Indian.
“We welcome today’s verdict in the ICJ. Truth and justice have prevailed. Congratulations to the ICJ for a verdict based on extensive study of facts. I am sure Kulbhushan Jadhav will get justice. Our government will always work for the safety and welfare of every Indian,” PM Modi said.

L&T chief AM Naik appointed as Mindtree Chairman
Larsen and Toubro (L&T) Group Chairman AM Naik has been appointed as the Non-Executive Chairman of mid-sized IT services firm Mindtree on Wednesday. The move follows L&T's acquisition of a controlling stake in the Bengaluru-based company. Mindtree CEO Rostow Ravanan, Executive Chairman Krishnakumar Natarajan and Executive Vice Chairman NS Parthasarathy had resigned earlier this month.

Livemint
Mumbai: Bengaluru-based IT services firm Mindtree Ltd., which has recently been acquired by engineering giant Larsen and Toubro Ltd. has appointed A M Naik (the current chairman of L&T) as the company's new non-executive chairman with effect from Thursday, according to an exchange filing by Mindtree.
Naik replaces Krishnakumar Natarajan, who resigned as the chairman and a board member from Mindtree on 5 July.
On Tuesday, L&T became the new promoter of Mindtree after buying a 60.59% stake in the latter and inducting three nominees from L&T as directors in Mindtree.
Mindtree's four founders, Subroto Bagchi, NS Parthasarathy, Natarajan and Rostow Ravanan, who together hold around 13.32% in Mindtree and served as directors on the company's board for two decades, quit the company after L&T succeeded in concluding its open offer on 30 June.
Mindtree, in its exchange filing, said that the company's nomination and remuneration committee and the board of directors appointed Naik after a board meeting on Wednesday.
Naik has been the group chairman of L&T for the past 20 years. He has been serving the $18 billion conglomerate for over 54 years.

China search engine project 'Dragonfly' terminated: Google
Karan Bhatia, Google's Global Government Affairs and Public Policy VP, has revealed the technology giant has "terminated" its controversial Chinese search engine project 'Dragonfly'. Google had repeatedly faced heavy criticism over its decision to create a censored search engine to comply with Chinese laws. Google CEO Sundar Pichai, in late 2018, had said work on the project was "limited".

SAN FRANCISCO: 
Google's controversial China search engine project, named Dragonfly, has been terminated and employees working on it have been reportedly reassigned.
The controversial Chinese search engine previously in development by Google that raised privacy, censorship, and human rights concerns is finally, officially, no more, mashable.com on Tuesday quoted Karan Bhatia, Google's vice president of global government affairs and public policy, as saying.
Responding to questions from Republican Senator Josh Hawley, the top Google executive said: "We have terminated Project Dragonfly."
This unequivocal response is a departure from previous couched statements by Google executives regarding Dragonfly's status. For example, in December, chief executive Sundar Pichai told Congress that "right now there are no plans for us to launch a search product in China", the report added.
Meanwhile, the tech giant's offices in the US, UK, Canada, India, Mexico, Chile, Argentina, Sweden, Switzerland, and Denmark have witnessed protests by human rights groups over its plan to re-enter China through the censored search application.
Senior Google employees have also resigned citing lack of corporate transparency after the company revealed its efforts to re-enter China through "Dragonfly".
The search engine giant had launched a search engine in China in 2006 but pulled the service out of the country in 2010, citing Chinese government efforts to limit free speech and block websites.

Noida Authority to clean commercial areas at night: CEO
The Noida Authority CEO said that the city's commercial areas will be cleaned at night as sanitary workers find it difficult to sweep the areas during the day. She also directed officials to ensure the elimination of open dumping spots by August 31. Thanking the CEO, Sector 18 Market Association President said, markets also need dustbins at various spots.

The New Indian Express
NOIDA: Sweeping in commercial areas of the city will take place during night instead of day, the Noida Authority decided Wednesday, with markets associations lauding the move.
The authority's newly-appointed Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Ritu Maheshwari held an inter-department meeting where she directed officials to ensure elimination of open dumping spots at public areas within 45 days.
"There are 360 such open dumping zones in the city and the Health, Civil and Horticulture departments have been asked to work in tandem to ensure their clearance and beautification of these sites by August 31," Maheshwari said.
"Cleanliness drive should be carried out in commercial areas of the city during night time. With vehicles occupying a lot of space in markets during the day, it becomes difficult for sanitation workers to effectively sweep the area, hence this decision," she added.
The authority officials did not mention by when this new directive would be implemented but said it would be done "soon".
Sector 18 Market Association president Sushil Kumar Jain said the new CEO's decision is a commendable step, which will not only send out a good message about cleanliness but also boost trade opportunities.
"We had been demanding this for a long time. Earlier also similar efforts were made but could not sustain for long. This time we are hopeful it will work. There is also need for dustbins at various spots in markets, which will also help in maintaining cleanliness," he said.
"We are thankful to the new CEO for according priority to markets and traders but we hope her instructions are effectively implemented by the authority staff," Jain added.

On July 14, Sunday, the world saw probably the best ODI of all time between England and New Zealand, which was also the final of the ICC World Cup 2019. The hosts were chasing a meagre total of 242 runs set by the Kiwi team and the initial match ended up in a tie, the first for any final in tournament history and in another first in ODI history, Super Over was employed to find the champions.
Henry Nicholls made a valiant fifty in the finals as England bowlers kept the pressure on the hosts, who were looking for their first-ever world title. Somehow, they posted 241/8 in 50 overs. Their bowlers reduced England to 89/4 and then in pressure, Ben Stokes and Jos Buttler added over 100 runs to bring the team back in the final. However, Kiwis pegged the batsmen back and Stokes managed to make the 15 runs required in the last over, when 16 were needed and the match was tied, with everything coming down to the super over.

When the super over was employed for the very first time in the ODI cricket history, England batted first and needed to send two batsmen to take advantage of the six balls. However, the England all-rounder Ben Stokes revealed that he wasn’t ready to go out there and bat again with Jos Buttler, as he was angry at not finishing the game.
“I was annoyed at myself, I was angry, I thought I’d thrown it away but when I went upstairs I had to give myself five minutes because Morgs (Morgan) wanted me to go back out and do the super over. I said that we should send Jos [Buttler] and Jason [Roy] out but Morgs said we need a left and right because it’s a small boundary. I had to go out the back into the shower room and give myself five minutes. ‘I never want to be involved in one [super over] ever again,” the 28-year-old all-rounder was quoted as saying by timesnownews.
England managed 15 runs in 6 balls with Stokes hitting a six off Boult. In return, New Zealand tried their best with Neesham making 13 runs and hitting Archer for a six. However, Martin Guptill was run out coming for the second run which would have made New Zealand champions and the super over was tied. England won the contest on the basis of hitting more boundaries in the match than the Kiwis, which was seen as a controversial ruling by many.

Abdul Razzaq reveals he has had 5-6 affairs after marriage
Former Pakistan all-rounder Abdul Razzaq, during a TV programme, said that he has had "five-six affairs that also had a validity of 1-1.5 years". He further said that all those affairs happened after he got married. "How do people laugh and clap at such statements? Won't be laughing when they're at [the] receiving end," a user tweeted reacting to it.

Former Pakistan all-rounder Abdul Razzaq had said after his country’s heavy defeat to arch-rivals India in the cricket World Cup 2019 that he would like to coach Hardik Pandya to make him as one of the best all-rounders in world cricket. Razzaq had also made a controversial remark after India’s loss to England that seamer Mohammed Shami performed well in the match because he is a Muslim (Shami took 5 for 69 in that game). Razzaq’s frustration was understandable since Pakistan’s chances of making the quarter-finals had taken a huge blow after India lost the match.
And now, the 39-year-old former cricketer has confessed that will certainly put the cricketing world on fire once again. Razzaq made his bold confession while speaking on a TV programme. The former batting all-rounder said he has had five-six extramarital affairs that also had a validity of 1-1.5 years. And when the astonished anchor asked him whether those had happened before marriage, Razzaq said they had happened after his conjugal life started.

Razzaq’s confessions took all those who present on the show by surprise. The man had represented Pakistan in 46 Tests, 265 ODIs and 32 T20Is. He scored over 8,000 runs and took 389 wickets in international cricket.
In a matter of coincidence, Hardik Pandya too had made a similar confession on a reality show back in January. He was accused of making sexist remarks related to women and the episode had seen him getting suspended, along with KL Rahul who was also on the programme, although temporarily.
He missed the ODI series in Australia and a couple of games in New Zealand and it was a big blow for the cricketer who was just about to make a comeback after a long stint with an injury. Nevertheless, Hardik made it to the World Cup and produced a decent performance for his team, both with the bat and ball.

About his coaching proposal for Hardik, Razzaq had said in his tweets: “Today I have been closely observing Pandya and I see a lot of faults in his body balance while hitting the bowl hard. I observed his footwork as well and I see that has also let him down sometimes. If I can give him coaching, for example in the UAE, I can make him one of the better all-rounders, if not the best. If the BCCI wants to make him a better all-rounder I will always be available.”

If I travel with players, we won't have another Sindhu: Gopichand
Talking about not travelling with players like PV Sindhu on the international circuit, national badminton coach Pullela Gopichand said, "If I was just travelling, what happens to the next batch, we would never have a Sindhu come out then." He further said that he needs more coaches as he can't do it alone. "Everybody needs personal attention," he stated.

Times Now
New Delhi: India's top shuttlers have missed his court-side presence this year but national badminton coach Pullela Gopichand says he can't really help cutting down on travelling as that would come in the way of finding the next crop of world-beaters.
Gopichand hasn't been travelling with the likes of PV Sindhu on the international circuit this year and he doesn't intend to change that until next year. "If I was just travelling, what happens to the next batch, we would never have a Sindhu come out then. So we need more coaches, I can't do it alone. I need more help and support," Gopichand tod PTI in an interview.
All the top Indian players, including Olympic silver-medallist Sindhu, London Olympics bronze-medallist Saina Nehwal and K Srikanth, have achieved success under the guidance of Gopichand. But with Indian badminton growing by leaps and bounds, Gopichand has been left with less time to devote to the top players, which leave come of them aggrieved.
Last month, there were reports that the relationship between Sindhu and Gopichand has deteriorated, something which the Indian ace rubbished later on. "Everybody needs personal attention, and lot more court time from me which is not always possible. I keep getting it that 'Bhaiya, you were not there, if you were there I would have won'," Gopichand, a 2001 All England Champion, said.
"So what do you focus on? Since 2008-09, every year which is the Commonwealth and Asian Games or Olympic year I have travelled and the other year I didn't travel. So this year I'm not travelling but in 2020 I will travel."
Asked if he has chalked out his strategy for the Olympics, Gopichand said: "Last time, I travelled with the top players in the last few tournaments and then decided my plan. So, this time too ahead of the Olympics, in February and March, I will be travelling with the team and decide my plan for the Olympics."
Gopichand produced two Olympic medallists in Saina and Sindhu at the 2012 London and the 2016 Rio Games. The 45-year-old from Hyderabad hoped with new foreign coaches joining the camp, India will deliver yet again.
"Challenges that I have is about coaches. Luckily, we have a few coaches now since February. I have taken a backseat to ensure that these coaches take over and start working with the players," said Gopichand.
"We have Flandy (Limpele) and Namrih (Suroto) for doubles and Park (Tae Sang) and Kim (Ji Hyun) for women's and men's singles. So with all of them on board, now I'm able to have an overall look at the entire picture rather than focus on just individuals. I hope results will keep coming."
However, Gopichand said for consistent results, India need to put in more effort to streamline the system. "For sport to develop, you need coaches, we need players, system, and a disciplined structure. We haven't groomed any coaches. we haven't started anything, we need to focus on the domestic structure," he said.

Juventus to be called Piemonte Calcio in FIFA after signing PES deal
Juventus will be known as 'Piemonte Calcio' in the next FIFA game after signing a naming rights deal with FIFA's rival Pro Evolution Soccer. Piemonte Calcio will have its own badge and kit, designed by EA Sports. This is the first time in 25 years that FIFA will not hold the licence for the Italian first division champions.

Daily Mail
Juventus will be known as 'Piemonte Calcio' on the next FIFA game after signing a naming rights deal with Pro Evolution Soccer. 
FIFA's traditional rival have stolen a march on their video game competitor, although the names and faces of Juventus players will stay realistic. 
The 2020 version of PES secured exclusive naming rights with an agreement between Konami and the Italian champions. 
Cristiano Ronaldo's Juventus have signed a name rights deal with Pro Evolution Soccer
This deal entitles PES to the name, kit, stadium and badge for Juventus in their game. 
The licensing issue has pushed many gamers to FIFA over the years as they enjoy playing with more realism. 
But PES are fighting back and over the past few seasons have incrementally started to claim rights of their own. 
Barcelona, Liverpool and Inter Milan have agreed partnerships from everything from team strips to crowd chants. 
But the fact that Juventus and Cristiano Ronaldo are now PES property will particularly rankle given that the striker has been a cover star for FIFA in the past. 
Gamers will now have to play as Piemonte Calcio if they want to use Juventus on FIFA

KUALA LUMPUR: The Indian football team was Wednesday handed a comparatively easy draw for the 2022 World Cup second round Asian qualifiers, being clubbed with Qatar, Oman, Afghanistan and Bangladesh in Group E.
The 40 Asian countries were divided into eight groups of five teams each in the draw held at the Asian Football Confederation headquarters here.
All the teams in each group will play home-and-away round-robin matches starting from September 5.
The eight group winners and four best runners-up will advance to the final round of 2022 World Cup qualifiers and the 2023 AFC Asian Cup Finals, to be held in China.
The next best 24 teams from the second round of the joint qualifiers will compete in a separate competition for the remaining 12 slots in the 24-team AFC Asian Cup.
India avoided the big guns from Pot 1 like Iran, Japan, Korea, Australia and Saudi Arabia, but drew Asian Cup champions Qatar.
India were also not drawn alongside bigger teams from Pot 2 like Iraq and Uzbekistan.
India can beat the likes of Afghanistan and Bangladesh and will hope to play their best against Oman, as well as World Cup hosts Qatar, if they have to advance to the final round of the qualifiers.
Interestingly, India were also drawn along with Oman in the second round qualifiers of the 2018 World Cup.
The Arab nation beat India 2-1 (in Bengaluru) and 3-0 (in Muscat) in 2015.
But the latest clash between the two sides, just before the 2019 Asian Cup, had ended in a goal-less draw in Abu Dhabi last December.
India head coach Igor Stimac termed the draw "a very tough challenge".
"It will be an enormous challenge for your young team. We have been drawn into a very tough group," Stimac said.
Without singling out any team, Stimac said that "we need to respect every opposition".
"We need to respect everyone, not only teams from Pot 1, and Pot 2, but even teams from Pot 3, and Pot 4. The Intercontinental Cup showed to all how strange a game of football is.
The two teams which are playing the final (Tajikistan, and DPR Korea) are the lowest FIFA ranked teams in the tournament. That shows that everyone can beat everyone," he said.
"I will teach the team to respect the opposition, but when we step on to the pitch, we will do everything to win. That is the way I am going to prepare my team. We are just at the beginning of our journey. I hope that it will be a long one," he added.
Wednesday's draw was conducted by FIFA Director of Competitions Christian Unger and Australian legend Tim Cahill.
Asia's top-ranked side Iran, who will be aiming for a third consecutive World Cup appearance, were pooled in Group C alongside Iraq, Bahrain, Hong Kong and Cambodia.
Japan, Asia's best performers in the 2018 FIFA World Cup where they were defeated by Belgium in the Round of 16, were drawn in Group F with Kyrgyz Republic, Tajikistan, Myanmar and Mongolia.
Korea Republic, who have appeared in every edition of the FIFA World Cup Finals since 1986, will have Lebanon, DPR Korea, Turkmenistan and Sri Lanka in Group H of the Asian Qualifiers.
Saudi Arabia will face Uzbekistan, Palestine, Yemen and Singapore in Group D while Australia will go up against Jordan, Chinese Taipei, Kuwait and Nepal in Group B.
China, the host country for the AFC Asian Cup 2023, will have to navigate past Syria, Philippines, Maldives and Guam in Group A in their bid for a second appearance in the FIFA World Cup Finals.

India has potential to win 100 Olympic medals by 2032: Rajyavardhan
Ex-Sports Minister Rajyavardhan Singh Rathore has said that with various steps taken by government for promotion of sports and its infrastructure in the country in last five years, India has the potential to win 100 Olympic medals by 2032. Rathore added that the 'Khelo India' campaign initiated by PM Modi government has changed the attitude of the country towards sports.

With various steps taken by the government for promotion of sports and its infrastructure in the country in the last 5 years, winning 100 Olympic medals by 2032 could be a possibility, Rajyavardhan Singh Rathore said in the Lok Sabha on Wednesday.
Participating in a debate on Demands for Grants of Ministry of Youth and Affairs, he said the Khelo India campaign launched by Prime Minister Narendra Modi has brought a remarkable change in the arena of sports.
Rathore, a former Youth and Sports Minister, said the Khelo India campaign initiated by the Modi government has changed the attitude of the country towards sports.
Thanking Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman for the proposal to set up a National Sports Education Board during her budgetary announcements, he said, it will help widen the scope of Khelo India campaign.
Besides, he said, the government has envisaged setting up of a sports school in every district.
Rathore, an Olympic medal winner, said there is no dearth of money for sports now with setting up of the National Sports Development Fund.
He expressed hope that winning 100 medals in 2032 Olympic Games can be a realty with various steps taken by the government and pool of talents available across the country.
Participating in the debate Danish Ali (BSP) asked the government to take steps to clean up various sports associations in the country.
Hibi Eden (Cong) said the government should desist from changing the name of Nehru Yuva Kendra which has been playing a major role.
The government’s move to remove the name of Nehru would be unholy on the part of the ruling party given the tremendous contribution the first Prime Minister made in shaping India, he added.

Privacy concerns raised over photo app FaceApp, company responds
The Russian company behind the viral photo-editing app 'FaceApp', that lets users virtually look older, responded to the privacy concerns over the users' photos. "Most images are deleted from our servers within 48 hours," FaceApp said. "We might store an uploaded photo in the cloud...We want to make sure users don't upload the photo repeatedly for every edit," it added.
https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/17/faceapp-responds-to-privacy-concerns/?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts
TechCrunch
FaceApp,  the AI-powered selfie-editing app that’s been having another viral moment of late, has now responded to a privacy controversy that we covered earlier here.
We’ve pasted the company’s full statement at the bottom of this post.
The tl;dr here is that concerns had been raised that FaceApp, a Russian startup, uploads users’ photos to the cloud — without making it clear to them that processing is not going on locally on their device.
Another issue raised by FaceApp users was that the iOS app appears to be overriding settings if a user had denied access to their camera roll, after people reported they could still select and upload a photo — i.e. despite the app not having permission to access their photos.
As we reported earlier, the latter is actually allowed behavior in iOS — which gives users the power to choose to block an app from full camera roll access but select individual photos to upload if they so wish.
This isn’t a conspiracy, though Apple could probably come up with a better way of describing the permission, as we suggested earlier.
On the wider matter of cloud processing of what is, after all, facial data, FaceApp confirms that most of the processing needed to power its app’s beautifying/gender-bending/age-accerating/-defying effects are done in the cloud.
Though it claims it only uploads photos users have specifically selected for editing. Security tests have also not found evidence the app uploads a user’s entire camera roll.
FaceApp goes on to specify that it “might” store the photos users have chosen to upload in the cloud for a short period, claiming this is done for “performance and traffic” — such as to make sure that a user doesn’t repeatedly upload the same photo to carry out another edit.
“Most images are deleted from our servers within 48 hours from the upload date,” it adds.
It also claims no user data is “transferred to Russia”, even though its R&D team is based there. So the suggestion is that storage and cloud processing are being performed using infrastructure based outside Russia. (We’ve asked it to confirm where this is done. Update: Founder Yaroslav Goncharov told us it uses AWS and Google Cloud.)
“We don’t sell or share any user data with any third parties,” it adds.
FaceApp also says users can request their data is deleted. Though it doesn’t yet have a very smooth way to do this — instead it asks users to send delete requests via the mobile app using “Settings->Support->Report a bug” with the word “privacy” in the subject line, adding that it’s “working on a better UI for that”.
It also points out that the vast majority of FaceApp users don’t log in — making the point that it’s not able to link photos to identities in most cases.
Here’s its statement in full:
We are receiving a lot of inquiries regarding our privacy policy and therefore, would like to provide a few points that explain the basics:
1. FaceApp performs most of the photo processing in the cloud. We only upload a photo selected by a user for editing. We never transfer any other images from the phone to the cloud.
2. We might store an uploaded photo in the cloud. The main reason for that is performance and traffic: we want to make sure that the user doesn’t upload the photo repeatedly for every edit operation. Most images are deleted from our servers within 48 hours from the upload date.
3. We accept requests from users for removing all their data from our servers. Our support team is currently overloaded, but these requests have our priority. For the fastest processing, we recommend sending the requests from the FaceApp mobile app using “Settings->Support->Report a bug” with the word “privacy” in the subject line. We are working on the better UI for that.
4. All FaceApp features are available without logging in, and you can log in only from the settings screen. As a result, 99% of users don’t log in; therefore, we don’t have access to any data that could identify a person.
5. We don’t sell or share any user data with any third parties.
6. Even though the core R&D team is located in Russia, the user data is not transferred to Russia.
Additionally, we’d like to comment on one of the most common concerns: all pictures from the gallery are uploaded to our servers after a user grants access to the photos (for example, https://twitter.com/joshuanozzi/status/1150961777548701696).  We don’t do that. We upload only a photo selected for editing. You can quickly check this with any of network sniffing tools available on the internet.

Working presidents to work on their own: Chacko to Sheila Dikshit
Delhi Congress in-charge PC Chacko on Tuesday wrote to Delhi Congress chief Sheila Dikshit, saying that the Delhi Pradesh Congress Committee was constituted with the order that three working presidents will work independently. Chacko added that since Dikshit is "not keeping well", he has authorised the working presidents to hold meetings of district and block committee heads and take decisions.

The New Indian Express
NEW DELHI: Stating that Delhi Congress chief Sheila Dikshit is "not keeping well", AICC incharge PC Chacko on Wednesday authorised the three working presidents to hold meetings of district and block committee heads and take decisions, seen as an attempt to dilute her powers amid a deepening turf war between the two.
Chacko wrote to Dikshit apprising her of his decision following which she issued an "action note" of her own assigning different set of responsibilities to the working presidents.
Dikshit's aides said that she was in hospital for a routine check up and was discharged on Monday, and alleged that "rumours" were being spread about her health.
In his letter, Chacko expressed displeasure that his earlier directions were not implemented and some "so-called spokespersons" of the party were issuing "irresponsible" statements and questioning the decisions of All India Congress Committee (AICC) incharge.
He said that Assembly elections in Delhi are a few months away and the working of Delhi Congress Committee has to be streamlined as early as possible.

"As you are not keeping well and hospitalised and I did not receive any reply to my letters, in the interest of the party, I am authorising the working presidents to hold meetings of district and block presidents in their respective areas and take appropriate decisions to activate the party and report to you the decisions taken," Chacko wrote to Dikshit.
In the 'action note' signed by Dikshit, working president Haroon Yusuf was allocated supervision of East Delhi Municipal Corporation, four Assembly segments(Timarpur, Burari, Okhla and Jungpura), Mahila Congress, Sewa Dal and NSUI.
Devender Yadav was assigned South Delhi Municipal Corporation and Youth Congress, while Rajesh Lilothia was allocated North Delhi Municipal Corporation and cells of Delhi Congress.
Sources said Chacko also wrote letters to the three working presidents asking them to monitor the party affairs in their respective areas and hold meetings and plan organisational programmes.
ALSO READ: Anger brewing against PC Chacko in Delhi Congress
The differences between the two leaders had surfaced in Lok Sabha elections with Chacko, and former Delhi Congress chief Ajay Maken supporting an alliance with AAP in Delhi which was strongly resisted by Dikshit and her followers.
The alliance did not come about, and Congress lost on all seven Lok Sabha seats in Delhi.
The tussle intensified as Dikshit dissolved all 280 block committees and started the process of selecting new block presidents by appointing district and block observers.
In a letter to Dikshit on last Sunday, Chacko overturned her decision to dissolve the block committees.
I am sorry to say that a senior leader of your status should not have flouted AICC rules by taking a decision leading to unrest and differences in the party. I have received numerous complaints from block presidents, ex DPCC presidents and working presidents against the action under your signature, he had written.
The three working presidents too wrote to Dikshit on last Sunday, expressing sadness that decisions were being taken "unilaterally" without even informing them.

Court withdraws order to distribute Quran for bail over communal post
A Jharkhand court has modified its earlier order which had mandated a student, accused of writing a communal post on social media, to distribute five copies of the Holy Quran for bail. The court withdrew the order after the police filed an application saying it was difficult to implement the condition. Notably, the student had refused to obey the order.

India.com
Ranchi: A Ranchi court on Wednesday modified its earlier order which mandated distribution of copies of the Holy Quran by student named Richa Bharti, ANI reported. She was earlier arrested for allegedly uploading a communal post on social media.
“The I.O. has prayed that the condition of donating Holy Kuran by the petitioner may be done away with because of difficulties in its implementation. The petition of the I.O. has been forwarded by Id. AAP (sic),” the Court of Judicial Magistrate XXI, Ranchi said in a statement.

On July 12, Richa Bharti, a BCom student, was arrested following a complaint filed by a member of the Anjuman Committee for allegedly sharing a communal post on Facebook.
She was earlier ordered by the Court to distribute the Holy Quran as a condition for bail. However, she refused to abide by the verdict and reportedly approached the Jharkhand High Court for relief, Financial Express reported.

3 TN SRM Institute students kill themselves in same manner in 60 days
A 21-year-old student killed himself at Tamil Nadu's SRM Institute of Science and Technology's Kattankulathur campus on Monday, the third such incident there in a span of 60 days using the same method. The police said it has been understood that the victim had multiple arrears in his exam. In May, two students killed themselves inside the same campus.

The News Minute
On Monday, students and faculty at the SRM Institute of Science and Technology Kattankulathur campus (Kancheepuram district) woke up to devastating news. A 21-year-old student had killed himself in the campus. This was the third such incident inside the 250-acre campus in a span of 60 days, and all three students used the same method. While police sources say that the institute should have done more to avoid the deaths, faculty and some students tell TNM that this was not a case of institutional oversight.
Sree Raghav, a final year B.Tech student from Kanyakumari district, killed himself on Monday. The police are investigating the incident, but as per the first round of questioning, it has been understood that the victim had multiple arrears in his exam. In May, two students killed themselves inside the same Kattankulathur campus of the college, though different reasons were attributed to their suicides. The method that all three students used was the same, and all of them had accessed restricted areas of the campus.
(NOTE: TNM will not be revealing the method of suicide as mental health experts urge that such reporting may lead to more copycat suicides.)
A press statement from SRM Institute of Engineering and Technology expressed anguish over the incident and stated that as a policy, support and guidance is being offered by the college to students who are in need of counselling. However, speaking to TNM about Sree Raghav's suicide, a police officer at the Maraimalai Nagar station, in whose jurisdiction the college falls, said that the college should have been more careful in watching over its students.
"There have been two other suicides very recently in the same campus. The college should have installed preventive measures, and at least cordoned off restricted areas. But when our officers went for inquiry, they found that no such precautionary measures have been taken,” he said.
A professor at the college, however, told TNM that the institute had taken precautions, and the restricted area had been opened for some maintenance work only. The staff member, however, added that there is no clarity on how the students managed to access a restricted area in the previous two cases of suicides in the same campus.
A student of SRM said that students also get mailers frequently, telling them about counselling options available in case they need them. They also have a counsellor on campus, he said.
Psychological rehabilitation crucial
“People who are mentally disturbed or are in bereavement are vulnerable to copycat suicides. When they see others killing themselves, they tend to feel that it is the way out and follow them. Copycat suicides also happen among people who try it for fun and end up losing their lives,” explained Vandhana, a Chennai-based clinical psychologist. 
She added that following suicide attempts, while families and friends focus on physical health of the person who has survived, they do not focus as much on emotional well being.
“So what happens when the trauma is raw is that the next time they get triggered and attempt to kill themselves, it ends in death,” she said.
If you’re worried about a person’s mental health, there are some behavioural changes you can look out for.
Vandhana added that more suicide prevention helplines must be set up to address this issue in a holistic manner. Mass media must also do its part in preventing suicides, she added.
“Movies that give warning for alcohol and drugs, do not give similar warning for suicides. These warning one-liners don’t compensate for anything. We need to create more warning signs that are visible,” she said.
Making it clear that suicides do not happen in one day, Vandhana said that these build over a period of time and hence suicide prevention helplines must ideally double up and act as helplines which can aid people who need help to call and talk about their pain.

US' Ebix to acquire Indian travel company Yatra for ₹2,320 crore
US-based software firm Ebix has agreed to acquire Indian travel services company Yatra through a merger at an enterprise value of $337.8 million (₹2,320 crore). Yatra will become part of Ebix's travel portfolio EbixCash alongside Via and Mercury and will continue to serve customers under the Yatra brand. Ebix has invested nearly $700 million in India through EbixCash since 2017.
https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/17/ebix-yatra-acquisition/?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts
TechCrunch
Atlanta-based software firm Ebix  said today it is acquiring Indian online travel booking company Yatra through a merger deal at an enterprise value of $337.8 million as it looks to strengthen its position in India’s hotel and flight ticketing market.
Once the acquisition has completed, Yatra  will become part of Ebix’s EbixCash (the company’s Indian subsidiary) travel portfolio — which also includes Via and Mumbai-based Mercury — and will continue to serve customers under the Yatra brand, the two companies said. Ebix had invested north of $650 million in businesses in India, one of its key markets today, prior to the deal.
Yatra, which went public in 2016 following a reverse-merger with listed company Terrapin 3 Acquisition Corporation, counts India’s Network18, Reliance Capital, Macquarie Group and Rotation Capital among its shareholders.
Yatra, which posted a revenue of $31.7 million in Q4 2018, has over 800 corporate clients. The acquisition would allow it to pose a bigger challenge to MakeMyTrip, a local player that currently leads the market. It consolidated its market lead in India after buying its competitor Ibibo in 2016. In 2017, MakeMyTrip raised $330 million from Naspers and Ctrip. Thanks to a deal between the two investors earlier this year, China’s Ctrip now owns 49% of MakeMyTrip.
EbixCash, which has over 9,000 employees, posted an operating income of $41.5 million in Q4 2018, with a profit of $8.5 million. Ebix develops software solutions for insurance, financial, e-commerce, e-learning, healthcare and travel industries, and has established over 110,000 distribution outlets and amassed over 8,000 corporate clients.
The combined Yatra-Ebix entity will leverage Yatra’s large and loyal existing customer base, comprehensive service offering and multi-channel platform to take advantage of the dynamic and growing multibillion-dollar opportunity in India, the companies said in a joint statement. Yatra’s shares were up over 17% following today’s announcement in pre-market trading.
Travel has emerged as one of the fastest growing categories in India’s internet economy. In a presentation earlier this year, Yatra said the travel segment is on track to grow to $85 billion by 2022, with online platforms accounting for 45% of all transactions.
The companies said their board of directors have unanimously approved the deal and they expect to close it by the fourth quarter of this year. In a statement, they added, “Assuming a value of $4.90 per Yatra ordinary share, the transaction implies an enterprise value of $337.8 million at the Ebix collar price of $59 per share and post adjustment for indebtedness, working capital, warrants to be converted and minimum cash requirement, a net equity value of $239 million.”
The announcement follows months-long negotiations between the two firms. In March, Ebix offered to buy Yatra for $336 million, adding that it might reduce its offer size if Yatra does not accept the proposal soon enough.
Ebix said it is targeting an EbixCash IPO in the second quarter of next year. “The synergies and the cross-selling opportunities can create tremendous economic value for the shareholders, once the IPO is done,” the companies said.
Ebix owns stake in a number of companies in India. Earlier this year, it acquired 80% controlling stake in on-demand SaaS travel firm Zillious. The U.S.-based company’s Indian subsidiary has also acquired stakes in remittance provider Weizmann, online cab hiring platform AHA Taxis, B2B marketplace Routier, travel business Centrum Direct and e-learning firm Smartclass.
In 2017, Ebix acquired controlling stake in Itz Cash, a firm that offers prepaid cash cards, for over $120 million. It also owns assets in Delhi-based Pearl International Tour & Travels and Mumbai-based Lawson Travels & Tours.
Additionally, Ebix has claimed that it owns about three-quarters of the market share of foreign exchange sales at 32 international airports in India.
In a statement, Dhruv Shringi, co-founder and CEO of Yatra, said, “Becoming a part of Ebix’s EbixCash travel portfolio will enable us to continue on that path. As part of a larger diversified organization with the necessary scale and resources to be a leader in today’s dynamic travel marketplace, we will provide more options and an enhanced experience for our joint customers and will be an even stronger partner to the airline, hotel, car rental and other businesses we work with.”
“We are confident that combining Yatra’s loyal customer base, comprehensive service offering and multi-channel platform with Ebix’s complementary Via and Mercury businesses, will create a leading online travel platform and India’s largest corporate travel platform that will capture growth opportunities and deliver enhanced value to shareholders.”

18-yr-old defender Gahlot becomes India's 2nd youngest goalscorer
India's 18-year-old defender Narender Gahlot on Tuesday became the second youngest footballer to score a goal for the national team. Gahlot achieved the feat after his 51st-minute header in India's last league match of 2019 Intercontinental Cup against Syria. Jerry Zirsanga, who scored aged 16 in May 2004, is the youngest footballer to score for India.

The 18-year-old Narender Gahlot on Tuesday became the second-youngest player to score an international goal for the Indian football team. Gahlot achieved the feat during the team’s match against Syria in the Intercontinental Cup at the EKR Arena in Ahmedabad.
He registered the goal as he headed Anirudh Thapa’s corner against Syria. This was Gahlot’s first goal for India. Mizoram’s Jerry Zirsanga holds the record for being the youngest player to register a goal for the Blue Tigers.
Jerry was 16 years and 311 days old when he scored the goal against Kuwait in 2004.
On Tuesday, India played a 1-1 draw against Syria in their last group stage match of the Intercontinental Cup.
The match witnessed a fanatic first half, as both teams had a flurry of chances, but neither team was able to convert their chances and at half-time, the scoreline read 0-0.
In the second half, Gahlot struck a goal for India, giving them lead of 1-0 in the game. Gahlot’s thumping header found the back of the net off the cross of Anirudh Thapa in the 51st minute.
However, Syria were awarded a penalty kick, against the run of play, in the 78th minute, and Firas made the most out of it, as he equalised bringing the scoreline to 1-1.
India ended their Intercontinental Cup campaign with two losses and one tied match to their credit.

The Delhi government has released Rs 109 crore to all three municipal corporations in the capital for dealing with vector-borne diseases, such as dengue and chikungunya, in the ongoing monsoon season.
According to the government, the funds have been released following the direction of Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal to the urban development department.
Kejriwal directed the department to tell the BJP-led three municipal corporations — south, north and east — that there should be no excuse in dealing with dengue and chikungunya.
In a statement, the government said Kejriwal directed the department to take all necessary steps to ensure proper utilisation of funds so that preventive steps, like house-to-house visits of MCDs staff to check the spread of mosquitoes, are carried out.
North and East MCDs have been given Rs 57.15 crore and Rs 28.4 crore respectively while South Delhi Municipal Corporation got 23.57 crore under the health head.
In the past, the AAP government and the BJP-led municipal corporations have been at loggerheads on a range of issues, including strike of sanitation workers due to lack of funds.
Apart from this, under the education head, the government has released around Rs 46.75 crore to East, North and South MCDs.
North Delhi Municipal Corporation (NDMC) and East Delhi Municipal Corporation (EDMC) have got Rs 12.5 crore and Rs 22.5 crore respectively while the SDMC has been given Rs 11.75 crore under the same head.

The acquisition will complement the analytics, natural language processing and data visualization capabilities of its in-house Mosaic platform, helping it improve its data discovery, analytics and ability to process large datasets, the company said. Before Lymbyc's acquisiton, both firms had also worked as strategic partners for a year.

Vakrangee to set up EV charging stations across India
Vakrangee on Tuesday said it will set up electric vehicle (EV) charging stations across India through its 'Nextgen Vakrangee Kendra' outlets. It aims to expand its presence from 3,504 outlets across 19 states to at least 75,000 outlets by 2021-22 and 3 lakh by 2024-25. This follows government announcing ₹1.5-lakh income tax deduction on loan interest for purchasing EVs.

Vakrangee will set up electric vehicle (EV) charging infrastructure facilities across India through its Nextgen Vakrangee Kendra outlets. Vakrangee has 3,504 Nextgen Vakrangee Kendra outlets spread across 19 states, with 68% outlets in Tier 5 and Tier 6 cities. Vakrangee plans to increase the number of Nextgen Vakrangee Kendra outlets to 75,000 by FY2021-22 and 3,00,000 outlets by FY2024-25.
"Vakrangee plans to leverage this deep presence by being an enabler for the EV charging facility through its network of retail outlets called as Vakrangee kendras. We continue to focus on expanding the bouquet of services available at our Nextgen Vakrangee Kendras," the company said in a statement.
"For all operators who want to set up electric vehicle services in India, It will make sense for them to leverage our charging infrastructure rather than building one of their own. We are building a large charging footprint on a pan-India basis through our network of Nextgen Vakrangee Kendra outlets," the company added.
Executive chairman Dinesh Nandwana, said: “We believe that the electric vehicle space is a huge growth opportunity for the coming years and we want to be future ready by developing a pan-India footprint of EV charging infrastructure. We would be an enabler by providing the distribution platform for the EV charging facility through our partnership with the EV service providers."
In Budget 2019, the government proposed to provide additional income tax deduction of  ₹1.5 lakh on the interest paid on loans taken to purchase electric vehicles as part of efforts to accelerate adoption of eco-friendly mobility solutions.
Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said the initiative would lead to a benefit of around  ₹2.5 lakh for a customer during the entire duration of the loan.
"Considering our large consumer base, we aim to leapfrog and envision India as a global hub of manufacturing of electric vehicles," she said.
In order to make EVs affordable, the government has already moved the GST council to lower the tax rate on such vehicles from 12 to 5 per cent, the finance minister said.
Incorporated in 1990, Vakrangee is into the business of providing last-mile retail outlets to deliver real-time banking and financial services, ATM, insurance, e-governance, e-commerce and logistics services to the unserved rural, semi-urban and urban markets. The assisted digital convenience stores are called as “Vakrangee Kendra" which acts as the “one-stop shop" for availing various services and products.
