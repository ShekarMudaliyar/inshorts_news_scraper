That is one of the reasons why I do the kind of films I do, there should be a counter narrative too. I know I’ll never be able to match up to the numbers of this film but that won’t deter me.

Please tell us, so we can also laugh,"" wrote another.",CricTracker,"A few weeks after India found themselves out of the cricket World Cup, it is MS Dhoni who has continued to steal the headlines. The ace wicketkeeper-batsman has still not called it a day, leaving a lot of quarters shocked and surprised. While it was being speculated whether Dhoni would still find himself in the Indian limited-over squads for the upcoming tour of the West Indies starting next month, a fresh twist was seen in the tale.The 38-year-old Dhoni informed the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) just before the team selection that he would not be available for two months since he will be serving the para regiment. Dhoni, who holds an honorary post of Lieutenant Colonel in the Parachute Regiment of the Territorial Army, was also granted permission by none other than Chief of Army Staff Bipin Rawat.AdvertisementIndia chief selector MSK Prasad announced the Indian squads for the T20Is, ODIs and Tests in the Caribbean and it was Rishabh Pant who was picked as the main keeper. In the Tests, Pant was accompanied with Wriddhiman Saha, who made a comeback to the Indian side after almost a year and a half.Meanwhile, Dhoni’s decision to join army training when the cricketing circles were busy contemplating his future saw yet another controversy. Former England cricketer and coach David Lloyd reacted to the news of Dhoni’s sabbatical with a couple of laughing emojis on the social media and he was taken on by the Indian fans who questioned what made the 72-year-old feel amused.The fans even attacked him calling him “coward” and “idiot”. Here are some of the reactions that the Twitterati came up against Lloyd, called “Bumble” as well.India will be playing three T20Is, three ODIs and two Tests against the Windies in the month-long tour. The selectors have taken a lot of new faces for the series while Virat Kohli will lead the side across the three formats. This is perhaps the first time that Dhoni will not be a part of the Indian squad in any format since making debut in 2004. He was not part of the T20I series against the West Indies and Australia last year but had played in the ODIs.",https://www.crictracker.com/twitter-lashes-out-at-david-lloyd-for-laughing-at-ms-dhonis-joining-army-training/?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

Tasbi is worn on each wrist. It allows users to get a sensation whenever they pick up objects, push buttons or touch a surface.",Engadget,"If VR is ever going to go mainstream, it's going to need to ditch the bulky accessories while still letting people interact with the virtual world. It's an idea that researchers at Facebook's Reality Labs are developing with a prototype called Tasbi. The device is a chunky, wrist-worn haptic bangle that uses a combination of squeezes and vibrations to let you ""feel"" what you're doing in-game.As explained by UploadVR, the idea is that you'd wear one Tasbi unit on each wrist, letting you get a sensation when you pick up objects, push buttons or touch a surface. Apparently, even though your fingers aren't touching anything, Tasbi is smart enough to make you think you are. Sadly, Tasbi doesn't do hand / finger / skeleton tracking, and so would have to be combined with a computer vision sensor.It remains to be seen if Tasbi would work for everyone, and Facebook promises to publish its research paper on the device in the near future. But it's heartening to know that companies are looking at ways to bridge one of the biggest divides between us and what we see on screen.

9,Australian swimmer Horton refuses to join China's Yang on podium,"Australian swimmer Mack Horton, who in the past labelled his Chinese rival Sun Yang as a ""drug cheat"", refused to take the podium with Yang at the World Aquatics Championships in South Korea on Sunday. Horton, who finished second behind Yang in 400m freestyle, had also declined to shake hands with Yang or pose for photos with him.",The Guardian,"Australia’s Mack Horton received a standing ovation at the athletes’ village after protesting against controversial Chinese star Sun Yang’s 400m freestyle win at the world swimming titles. American breaststroke champion Lilly King revealed Horton was greeted with applause from fellow competitors when he returned from the pool after refusing to acknowledge Sun on Sunday night.Olympic champion Horton did not shake hands with his bitter rival after being relegated to 400m silver by Sun and refused to join him on the podium on the titles’ opening night at Gwangju, South Korea. The controversy almost overshadowed a golden first night for Australia with Ariarne Titmus upsetting American great Katie Ledecky in the 400m freestyle and the women’s 4x100m freestyle relay team triumphing.Horton was unhappy that Sun, who served a 2014 doping ban, had been allowed to compete ahead of a Court of Arbitration for Sport hearing in September that may end the Chinese star’s career. The 10-time world champion has been accused of smashing vials of his blood with a hammer during a clash last year with testers and faces a lifetime ban if found guilty.“We were kind of waiting around for that awards ceremony to see what was going to happen and yeah it was awesome,” two-time Olympic gold medallist King said. “When we walked into the dining hall, he walked in after us and like the whole dining hall erupted in applause so it was pretty great to see the athletes united on his stance and supporting him as well. I don’t think anyone at FINA’s going to stand up for the athletes so the athletes have to stand up for themselves.”Australian officials spoke with world body FINA on Sunday night and were assured Horton did not face any sanction over his protest. But Sun, who claimed a fourth straight 400m world title, said Horton’s stance was disrespectful to China. “It was unfortunate because disrespecting me is OK but disrespecting China was very unfortunate and I felt sorry about that,” he said.The Australian team’s reaction to Horton’s protest will no doubt further infuriate Sun with the Dolphins throwing their support behind the 23-year-old. “That was his idea to do that. But let’s put it this way, I understand him very much,” Dolphins head coach Jacco Verhaeren said of the protest. “He has been very strong and vocal about this in the past ... you can only respect him for what he does.”Teammate Mitch Larkin said “99 per cent” of athletes at Gwangju backed Horton’s Sun snub. “I think 100% of the Aussie athletes certainly back Mack up. While he was standing alone on the podium last night he’s not standing alone in spirit,” he said. “I would say 99% of the athletes here support what he does. We are all fighting for a clean sport.”The controversy has added another chapter to Horton’s bitter rivalry with Sun. It began when Horton dismissed Sun as a “drug cheat” at the Rio Olympics, prompting the Chinese swimming team to demand an official apology. Their feud escalated after Horton upset Sun to claim a shock 400m freestyle gold at the 2016 Games.Meanwhile, Titmus became the first Australian woman to claim the world 400m title since Tracey Wickham in 1978 after pulling off an upset victory that snapped Ledecky’s staggering winning streak.Titmus clocked a Commonwealth record three minutes, 58.76 seconds on the opening night of the eight-day world titles in Gwangju, South Korea, on Sunday to upstage the once untouchable Ledecky.The American had not been beaten in 400m, 800m or 1500m freestyle at a major international meet since 2012 until the 18-year-old pulled off one of the great upsets. Yet Titmus’ hard marking coach Dean Boxall still found fault with the landmark swim.“I think she could have executed it a little bit better. It was a good swim, of course ... but it could have been better,” he said. “I thought she nearly missed an opportunity there.”Still, Titmus was confident she had done enough for Ledecky to take her seriously as a threat ahead of the 2020 Tokyo Olympics. Ledecky had refused to speak specifically about Titmus ahead of the titles despite the world No 2 ranked teenager’s impressive form, stonewalling reporters by claiming “everyone was a threat”.Titmus reckoned that may now have changed. “Now hopefully she is excited that she now has a battle with me,” Titmus said. However, Boxall warned Titmus’ win may come at a price. He believed a “pissed off” Ledecky would now be out for vengeance in her other two events in South Korea against Titmus – the 200m and 800m freestyle.… we have a small favour to ask.

11,ICC ran out of patience with Zimbabwe Cricket: Grant Flower,"Speaking about the suspension of the Zimbabwe Cricket board, former Zimbabwe cricketer Grant Flower has said that the ICC ran out of patience with Zimbabwe Cricket (ZC). ""ICC have just been worn down by all the corruption, fraud, and the problems with Zimbabwe Cricket not being able to get its house in order,"" Flower added.",Hindustan Times,"Former batsman Grant Flower says the ICC perhaps wanted Zimbabwe Cricket to be more responsible by suspending them for government intervention but doubted if the global body interpreted the SRC action in true sense. The ICC recently suspended Zimbabwe Cricket for violation of its constitution after the current elected members of the Zimbabwe board were suspended by the Sports and Recreation Committee (SRC). Flower said ICC may have wanted ZC to put its house in order but actually the current board members were “good people”. “I think over time, the ICC have just been worn down by all the corruption, fraud, and the problems with Zimbabwe cricket not being able to get its house in order. Maybe they thought a jolt to their system would make some people realise what was expected of them,” Flower told ESPNcricinfo.READ: Biggest talking points from India’s T20I, ODI and Test squads for WI tour “They would have reasoned Zimbabwe needed to understand that at some stage, you’ve got to put your house in order, and we can’t keep propping you up like we have been doing over the years. I can understand the player’s frustrations, but unfortunately with Zimbabwe cricket, it sounds like the ICC have just had enough.”   “....We can go back so many years to when things were very badly run. It’s pretty obvious what was happening at the time and the people responsible who were involved. And I think the current crop of players and the interim board, who are really good people, are being punished because the ICC felt they needed to take a stand.”   Zimbabwean Cricket has been in turmoil for many years now. In fact, 14 members, including Flower, had walked out of the system in 2004 when then skipper Heath Streak was dismissed for disagreements on racial quotas in the squad. However, things seemed to get better after former Olympic swimmer and Zimbabwe’s most famous sportsperson Kirsty Coventry was appointed Sports minister. Flower said SRC is a public body and he didn’t seem to agree with the way the ICC has interpreted government intervention in this case. “My understanding is the SRC is a public body and not exactly government. I think there’s quite a big difference there and I’m surprised the media hasn’t picked up on that. The SRC now is slightly more transparent,” he said. “Regarding government intervention, it’s curious how the ICC have decided to interpret that. There are other countries where it’s publicly stated that some of the times that certain things will be discussed and decided at government level. So I think there’s quite a big contradiction there from the ICC,” Flower added. Flower believes ICC decision will prevent Zimbabwe from playing cricket altogether.

I saw this thing on Twitter about Harare Sports club, it’s a beautiful ground and at the moment it’s just going to waste because no one is being paid and the staff have left,” he said.

Thailand, which had a tradition of using cannabis to relieve pain and fatigue, legalized marijuana for medical use and research last year. Bhumjaithai party leader Anutin Charnvirakul, now a deputy prime minister and health minister, said his goal was to enable all Thais to grow marijuana to make money. Anutin told local media it was important to remove hemp with a high level of cannabidiol (CBD) from the list of banned drugs for cultivation and then to free up hospitals to prescribe drugs containing the chemical compound.  Among other urgent government priorities were addressing drought, labor and economic problems. Also on the list was a study to amend a new constitution that critics say preserves the hold of the military indefinitely. This study had been a demand of another coalition partner, the Democrat Party. However, any constitutional changes would require the support of the Senate - which is entirely made up of appointees of the previous junta.

22,Will retaliate if US imposes sanctions over Russian S-400: Turkey,"Turkey would retaliate against what it called an unacceptable threat of US sanctions over the country's purchase of Russian S-400 missile defence system, Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu has said. ""This is not a threat or a bluff,"" he added. However, Cavusoglu further said he thinks US President Donald Trump wants to avoid such measures.",Reuters,"ANKARA (Reuters) - Turkey would retaliate against what it called an unacceptable threat of U.S. sanctions over Ankara’s purchase of Russian S-400 missile defenses, its foreign minister said on Monday, adding he thinks President Donald Trump wants to avoid such measures.  Turkey began receiving deliveries of the surface-to-air S-400 systems earlier this month, prompting the United States to begin removing the NATO ally from its F-35 stealth fighter program over security concerns.    “If the United States portrays an adversarial attitude towards us, we will take retaliatory measures, as we’ve told them. This is not a threat or a bluff,” Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said in an interview with broadcaster TGRT Haber. “We are not a country that will bow down to those who show a animosity towards Turkey,” he said, reiterating a threat of retaliation that Turkey made last month. Cavusoglu added that he did not expect the U.S. administration to take such action.  “Trump does not want to impose sanctions on Turkey and he frequently says that his administration and the previous U.S. administration is also responsible for Turkey not being able to buy Patriot systems. This is true,” Cavusoglu said. Last week, The United States announced that it was beginning the process of removing Turkey from the program for the F-35 stealth jets, the most advanced aircraft in the U.S. arsenal, which is used by NATO and other partner countries. Turkey, like other partners in the F-35 program, was part of the manufacturing supply chain for the high-tech jet aircraft, producing some 900 parts. A U.S. official said it would cost some $500 million to $600 million to shift F-35 manufacturing from Turkey. Separately, the TASS news agency cited Sergei Chemezov, head of Russia’s Rostec state conglomerate, as saying that Russia and Turkey were in talks about the possibility of jointly manufacturing some components of Russia’s S-400 missile defense system in Turkey.

The four firms audit for nearly 60% of top 500 companies on NSE.",Livemint,"New Delhi/Mumbai: The government wants the country's antitrust body to assess whether the so-called ""Big Four"" auditing firms and their affiliates are hurting competition in any manner, a senior government official told reporters.The Competition Commission of India (CCI) needs to conduct a survey or an investigation to assess whether the Big Four that include PwC, EY, Deloitte and KPMG are abusing their dominant position in the Indian audit market, said the official, who spoke about the matter on condition of anonymity.The Ministry of Corporate Affairs, which holds that view, is yet to send any formal request to the CCI to probe the matter, said the official.""If you look at the top 500 companies in India, they are totally dominant and the Big Four seem to be sharing the work ... whatever be the reason there seems to be entry barriers,"" the official told reporters.""The CCI should look into the dominance of these four global auditors and whether they are thwarting competition"".The CCI and the four auditors did not immediately respond to a request for comment.The Big Four do auditing work for almost 60% of the top 500 companies that trade on the National Stock Exchange (NSE), according to corporate data tracker NSE Infobase.The deliberations around an antitrust review come at a time when the Big Four are facing increased scrutiny in India.Last year, all the local units of PwC were barred from auditing any listed companies for two years in India after a probe into a decade-old accounting fraud. An EY firm was also barred last month from conducting certain statutory audit assignments until April 2020.In the latest case, Deloitte Haskins & Sells and a KPMG affiliate are fighting a legal battle with the Ministry of Corporate Affairs which wants to ban them for five years on allegations they violated several auditing standards at Indian financial firm IFIN, a unit of troubled lender IL&FS.Both Deloitte and the KPMG affiliate deny any wrongdoing. The government has also alleged Deloitte offered services to IFIN in breach of company law that prohibit auditors from rendering certain other services.The government official said India is mulling whether to cap the revenue an accounting firm can earn by offering non-audit services to a firm it is auditing, and if there should be prohibition on an auditor's parent firm offering tax advisory solutions.""We are studying the aspect of independence of auditors and various conflict of interest issues,"" said the official.The United Kingdom's competition watchdog in April proposed some of the biggest reforms to auditing globally, recommending new laws to force the Big Four firms to separate their audit and consulting arms.This story has been published from a wire agency feed without modifications to the text.

24,Hard to say when the NBFC crisis will be over: RBI Governor,"It is difficult to say when the crisis in the non-banking finance company (NBFC) sector will be over, RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das said in an interview. He added RBI is making efforts to ensure there isn't a collapse of ""another systematically important NBFC"". The NBFC sector saw a liquidity crunch, sparked by IL&FS defaulting on its debt repayments last year.",Livemint,"Reserve Bank of India Governor Shaktikanta Das gave his first interview with media since taking office in December. Here’s an edited transcript of the topics he covered in the more than 50 minute interview.On the economic slowdown and the RBI’s response:""The accommodative stance will depend on incoming data. How inflation numbers look how the growth numbers look. Primarily how inflation looks. With regard to the slowdown, I would not give a particular timeline and it’s not possible. But overall if you see the trend, I think the fourth quarter of last year was partly a base effect and partly due to investment slowdown and demand contraction, which I had articulated in the monetary policy committee minutes. For that, so far as monetary authority is concerned, the law gives us a certain role and mandate and we have tried our best to play that role. We have reduced the policy rates by 75 basis points and we have shifted to accommodative. And shifting of the stance to accommodative itself means a rate cut of 25 basis points at least. So therefore effectively, the rate cuts has been 100 basis points if you take into account the change in stance.""On providing liquidity:""Parallel to that we have also ensured surplus liquidity in the system. Liquidity was in deficit but at the moment for the past 1 1/2 months, the system is in liquidity surplus by more than 1 trillion rupees.“We will ensure the banks are provided adequate funds. While the system is in surplus mode, it is possible that one or two banks may have liquidity issues. Given the role the RBI is assigned, inflation is primary target, and given due weightage to the fact that growth momentum has slowed down. For the revival, various stakeholders have to play the role.""On investment slowdown:""There have been sectoral problems, like in the auto sector. Our survey shows that additional insurance requirements has had an impact. So every sector has had its problem. But when the world is changing you also have to change. Then there was the credit squeeze; now availability is there. The banks were unable to lend significantly, burdened with NPAs and the focus of the banks was on recovery and consolidation and not on credit. The banks are now in a better position to lend. While banks were not lending, NBFC entered their space. But for a year or so, credit flow has been affected. Another thing I would like to address the crowding out effect. It’s a good thing that the fiscal deficit has been brought down and recapitalization has been announced. Every stakeholder, the government, the private sector and the RBI are playing their role and I think things are moving in the right direction. And things should improve now.""On liquidity and NBFC problems:""We have to constantly monitor and remain alert as the regulator and as a monetary authority. We have to analyse and review the situation. Here at the RBI, we have broad medium and long-term goals. If some issue becomes critical, not a day passes without some internal high-level review. On NBFC, not a day passed in the last several months where we don’t have a discussion or a review internally. Either on the sector or individual NBFCs. And we are monitoring the top 50 NBFCs which we have identified in terms of balance sheet size, volume of operation and in terms of governance practices and credit behavior. Our supervision teams are closely monitoring them. We are in constant interaction with the banks and it’s our endeavor to ensure a collapse of another NBFC, especially a large one, doesn’t happen. Having said that, if NBFCs have undertaken certain governance practice and certain ways of function and they have to a price for it, they will have to pay a price for it.""On banks being proactive:""We are in constant engagement with banks. After the June 7 circular, the banks are more enabled to resolve the crisis and stress in the individual NBFCs. Now inter-credit agreement is mandatory. Earlier it wasn’t. We have also given 30 days for review and another six months for restructuring and we are having constant engagement with the banks. So the banks, under the June 7 circular, have to play a proactive role. We are constantly in touch with large lenders to such NBFCs, including some housing finance, where we see some signs of fragility.""Consolidation in NBFCs:""If somebody has diverted or there has been sort of ever-greening, there has been gold plating, if there has not been so diligent lending, so obviously they have to pay the price. Our effort is to segregate the way there have been lapses. Our focus is the overall system maintains stability. When I say system, it obviously includes all the major players. Therefore, our effort is to see that there is no repeat instances of systemically important large NBFC collapsing. And in the process some promoters have to make certain sacrifices, promoters have to accept haircut, the banks will have to deal with it appropriately within the parameters. One or two cases, the banks have signed inter-creditor agreements and they are resolving this crisis. The way I look at it, the responsibility is on the NBFCs themselves, to find market instruments to resolve their problems. Market instruments and the promoter has to bring in additional capital, he has to do a stake sale, he has to securitize his assets and mobilize liquidity, he has to meet debt obligations. And then the role of the lenders. We are in discussion with the lenders who have to protect their money also. They also have a parallel role to try and resolve this issue. That will also mean sacrifice on the part of the promoter also. The RBI will ensure adequate liquidity to banks.""On refinancing:""This Refinance window or a liquidity window is a misnomer. We cannot lend money directly to one NBFC. Under the law, RBI is the lender of last resort, but we haven’t reached that situation where we invoke that particular legal provision. So RBI in today’s time cannot and would not be lending directly to NBFCs. We cannot give them clean money. It is up to the bank and depending on the collateral. We are backing up the banks. There is nothing called a liquidity window. Money is fungible, and when money is fungible having these windows, I think, is not relevant.""When will the crisis be over?""Difficult to say when it finishes. It’s our effort to ensure there is no contagion. It is our endeavor to ensure there is no collapse of another systematically important NBFC.""On cases of adventurism:""There have been instances where it has happened. Some of the NBFCs have diverted. It hasn’t happened in a large scale. That is not the case. In some cases, we have noticed this has happened. A large number have encountered business failures, encountered external factors, which has impacted business models. We are coming up with a new regulatory framework. We are a work in progress. Risk management guidelines are also there for NBFCs. Now HFCs are coming under RBI, we are constantly reviewing it internally. The RBI’s endeavor is a well functioning NBFC sector and a robust regulatory framework which prevent the kind of situation we have encountered in the past year.""On the U.S.-China trade war and what it means for India:""India is not part of the global value chain. So, U.S.-China trade tension does not impact India as much as several other economies which are part of the global value chain. Second thing is about trade tensions, it has a lowering of global growth and contraction of demand and that would in a way have a role on oil prices. Oil prices should remain low. These are the positives. In the long run, we cannot ignore lingering and prolonged tensions. It will definitely affect countries all over the world and definitely India, which is the sixth-largest economy. In the medium term also it will affect India. If it lingers, a contraction of global demand will have impact on our exports sector. We have large exports to Europe.""On RBI policy options:“We have to only see our domestic demand continues to be robust and ensure that there is a domestic demand revival and that remains strong. We have to ensure that these opportunities arising out of the trade war, relocation of investment, India should utilize it. Irrespective of the trade war, India should become competitive both in the services and the manufacturing sector.""On the risk of dollar depreciation:""If they depreciate their currencies, it means greater inflows. When the reversal happens we have to manage spillover effect. If excess inflow comes in, it becomes a problem to absorb excess liquidity. It’s an evolving challenge. We will continue to deal with it. We have to keep in mind, in several advanced economies, bonds yields are negative, inflation is zero. In fact in my interaction with other central bankers, they are concerned about zero or low inflation. They would like to have a slightly higher inflation. Zero interest rates prevailing for far too long, it becomes unsustainable and undermines investor sentiment. In the overall context, India is much better than most other economies.""On structural reforms:""I don’t think the fiscal space is really the answer. If you have fiscal space any government can use. Long-term growth can be sustained by structural reforms, enhancing competitiveness, and focusing on an enabling business environment. So therefore, GST, IBC and the Niti Aayog’s committee on agriculture reforms, which will allow private investment in the farm sector and which will ensure better price to farmers for their produce, are crucial. The supply chain in the agricultural sector has to be addressed. The focus will have to be on structural reforms and improving competitiveness. Focus will have to be on continued ease of business and availability of credit at a reasonable price.""On improving growth prospects:The RBI’s ""essential role is to maintain price stability, which is defined in terms of inflation. Along with the objective of growth. Price stability is prime. It will depend on inflation, on incoming GDP. This year we have projected 7%. There was a lot of uncertainty, but now the monsoon is catching up in Tamil Nadu and Kerala. The western part had good rains and the monsoon outlook has improved compared to what it looked about three weeks ago and oil prices are remaining in the $65 range, but then you have extraneous factors like the trade tensions, sanctions on Iran, and then you have Brexit which creates uncertain sentiments and India has a lot presence in Britain in terms of investment and exports. I would not like to specify how long it (economic slowdown) will last. India is today in a far better place than most of the major economies and India has certain inherent resilience and the signs are looking good.""On core inflation:""Core inflation coming down, at one level, can be seen as a positive development but at another level it is reflective of a slowdown in the demand, so therefore I don’t want to make a qualitative judgement on good or bad. Based on hard numbers, we will have to take a call.""On global bond issuance:""RBI is the debt manager. There is a process of consulting between RBI and the government.""On recapitalization funds:""The 700 billion rupees is adequate for capital requirement but also for growth. The true test of efficiency of a public sector bank is whether they are able to access capital markets to raise additional capital. Otherwise just continuous and prolonged dependence on government capital infusion -- it can breed inefficiency. Banks need to access capital markets. There has to be competition in the banking sector. How many competitors are there in the field that the market will decide.""On interest-rate transmission:""There is a case for banks to show better monetary policy transmission. We have to keep in mind that banks have gone through a period of crisis and they are just recovering, they are just about recovering, so that aspect has also to be kept in mind. So if you drive and ask them to fix interest rates administratively, we cannot lose sight of the fact that banks will also have to recover and comeback to a level where they are out of the woods. If we see the PCA banks have fulfilled the conditions to come, they will come.""On payments banks:""Some are doing well. It’s a new model. It’s about two years. We are studying. We should wait a little longer how they play out.""On financial stability:""I would like to say our primary focus -- apart from price stability and keeping the objective of growth -- it is also to ensure the stability of the financial sector, which includes banks and NBFC. And in the long run, if India has to grow and show improved growth rates, it will need a well-functioning financial sector.""This story has been published from a wire agency feed without modifications to the text.

The complaint, filed by model Poonam Sethi in 2013, alleges that Koena borrowed ₹22 lakh over a period of time but at the time of repayment, she gave a cheque of ₹3 lakh which bounced. Koena has however denied the allegations.",The Quint,"Bollywood actor Koena Mitra has reportedly been convicted in a cheque bouncing case and sentenced to six months imprisonment by a metropolitan magistrate’s court. She was sentenced earlier in July. According to a report by Mumbai Mirror, the complaint was filed by model Poonam Sethi and Koena Mitra was asked to pay Rs 4.64 lakh to the complainant. The amount included interest of Rs 1.64 lakh.Poonam Sethi had filed the complaint in 2013 on account of her cheque bouncing for “want of funds.” However, the allegations have been denied by Koena, who will soon challenge the court’s judgement.According to case details reported by Mumbai Mirror, Koena Mitra had borrowed Rs 22 lakh from Poonam Sethi. This transaction occurred over a period of time. During repayment of the loan, Poonam Sethi received a cheque of Rs 3 lakh from Koena Mitra. However, this cheque was not accepted by the bank and bounced.Following the dishonouring of the cheque, Poonam Sethi sent a legal notice to Koena Mitra on 19 July 2013. Even after receiving the legal notice, Koena Mitra was unable to pay the required amount. Subsequently, Poonam Sethi filed a court complaint on 10 October 2013.During the court hearing of the case, Koena Mitra’s defence was based on the fact that the complainant did not have enough resources to be able to lend that big an amount.

31,Stokes didn't ask us to not award 6 overthrows in WC final: Dharmasena,"After a section of British media claimed that all-rounder Ben Stokes wanted umpires to not award England 6 overthrows in the 2019 World Cup final, umpire Kumar Dharmasena has said that no such request was made. Dharmasena further revealed that he apologised to New Zealand captain Kane Williamson the moment he realised he had made a mistake.",CricTracker,"It was another World Cup final for Kumar Dharmasena but this time, he hadn’t seen the best of days. The former Sri Lanka spinner, who is a top umpire in world cricket now, was slammed for awarding six runs to England after a throw from New Zealand’s Martin Guptill went for four overthrow runs after hitting the bat of a diving Ben Stokes at Lord’s on July 14. Former umpire Simon Taufel had later said that Dharmasena should have given five and not six runs to the chasing side. The extra run helped England tie the game and they went on to lift the trophy.Dharmasena, 48, is nicknamed ‘unanduwa’ which roughly means ‘hard worker’ and he has shown his worth in the official’s role in the past. He was also in charge of the final of the World Cup in 2015 at the Melbourne Cricket Ground which also featured New Zealand as the losing side. The Black Caps might find it hard to swallow to fact that Dharmasena’s presence in their finals didn’t see the end results going their way.AdvertisementEngland had needed 15 runs to win off the last over and after Stokes hit a six in the third ball, it was nine required off three. It was then when that overthrow drama took place and Stokes had come up with an apologising gesture after the ball went for four overthrows. Taufel had said that the second run shouldn’t have been added to England’s total since the batsmen (Stokes and Adil Rashid) hadn’t crossed when the fielder had released the throw.Dharmasena later regretted giving the verdict. Speaking to Sunday Island, Sri Lanka, he said: “I made a judgmental call after consulting my colleague Marais Erasmus. It was like calling a no-ball or a wide and I couldn’t consult the third umpire. I was 100 per cent sure that the batsmen had crossed. It looked as if he had almost reached the popping crease.”“I admit that I was wrong. I also admit that the rule has to change.”Dharmasena also had his own take on the rule. “If the ball hits the stumps and goes for four, then it’s fine. But the moment the ball hits the bat or the batsmen, it’s got to be a dead ball.”Meanwhile, a section of the British media had claimed that Stokes even went to the extent of asking the umpires to withdraw the four overthrow runs. Dharmasena rejected this version outright. He even had apologised to New Zealand skipper Kane Williamson the moment he realised that he had made a blunder.",https://www.crictracker.com/kumar-dharmasena-concedes-erring-in-awarding-vital-runs-to-england-denies-ben-stokes-wanted-to-withdraw-overthrow-runs/?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

This is the end where student teams load in their test pod during the annual competition.For the teams that did get to run on Sunday, the process involved loading their pod, which are roughly the size of bobsleds but little more than engines on wheels, onto the single track which runs the length of the interior of the Hyperloop test tube. The tube is then sealed and de-pressurized to near vacuum, which is essentially how Musk’s original Hyperloop concept envisioned the super-speed transportation method would work.All the teams gave a good showing, and the total number of student teams was actually 21, with over 700 individual sin total taking part in the competition from a variety of schools including Cal Poly, the University of Wisconsin-Madison, the Indian Institute of Technology and my own alma mater the University of Windsor (who worked with St. Clair College on their pod).Teams had to prove to their SpaceX and Boring Company staff advisors that they were ready to run in the tube in order to qualify for the finals, and spent two weeks prior to the finals on Sunday trying to do just that. Of those 21 teams, only the four finalists managed to get the green light to run in the final competition, based on advisor criteria that includes safety and survivability of their pod design. There’s a kind of ‘good luck’ mantra at the competition of saying ‘Break a pod’ prior to a run, but SpaceX engineers don’t actually want team pods to experience catastrophic failure inside the tube while on a run. This year, the competition was even more challenging because all pods have to use their own communication systems for the first time, and the pods must be designed to propel themselves to within 100 feet of the far end of the tube before they stop.21 teams in total competed in this year’s competition, and they all brought their pods to display on race day, even though only four finalists actually ran their pods through the test track.21 teams in total competed in this year’s competition, and they all brought their pods to display on race day, even though only four finalists actually ran their pods through the test track.Most of the teams I spoke to who failed to qualify were dismayed but also resolute on coming back and qualifying next year. Some did express a bit of frustration about the gap between some of the teams from smaller schools, and those in the final four (who do qualify repeatedly year after year). Many of the finalists have deep-pocketed corporate backers, including Airbus,  while some of the smaller schools have next to no funding – resulting in a cost delta of hundreds of thousands of dollars when it comes to the total bill for the test pods built.That said, all the teams are clearly thrilled to be able to participate, and see the competition as a chance to essentially get scored to work at one of Musk’s many high tech ventures, including SpaceX, Tesla  and The Boring Company. For those companies, too, it seems like a no-brainer to attempt to recruit from the engineering ranks of these best-in-class technical undergrad and graduate students.EPFL Hyperloop didn’t win the competition – but they have reason to celebrate, since at least some graduates will probably ‘win’ jobs at Musk’s various companies.EPFL Hyperloop didn’t win the competition – but they have reason to celebrate, since at least some graduates will probably ‘win’ jobs at Musk’s various companies.“I think the competition is fun, and inspiring and also useful technology comes out of it,” Musk said regarding the purpose of the event, before answering a final question from Boring Company President Steve Davis  about whether or not there will be another competition next year – “Oh yeah of course,” Musk replied, to much applause from the crowd of competitors.",https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/21/team-tum-wins-spacex-hyperloop-pod-competition-with-record-288-mph-top-speed/?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

Two people sustained minor injuries when seven pirates boarded the CK Bluebell and made off with $13,000 and belongings including mobile phones, clothes and shoes from the 22-strong crew, officials from the oceans and fisheries ministry said.   Tougher policing has made piracy less frequent on the strategic shipping route in recent years. The dry bulk vessel CK Bluebell had set sail from its anchorage off Singapore on Saturday afternoon, heading northeast for South Korea’s port of Incheon, Refinitiv Eikon ship tracking data showed.  Korean officials said the ship was sailing normally after the robbery. AdvertisementThe incident took place near the Singapore Strait, a busy sea lane that runs past Indonesia, Malaysia and Singapore, South Korea’s Yonhap news agency said.  Singapore’s Maritime and Port Authority (MPA) said the incident did not take place in city-state’s waters. “The MPA was informed by the Korea Coast Guard that it took place in the South China Sea near Anambas Islands,” a spokesman said.   This month, China’s Ministry of Transport raised its security recommendation for Chinese vessels in the nearby Malacca Strait, between the Malay peninsula and the Indonesian island of Sumatra.

Iranian state television published images it said showed the CIA officers who were in touch with the suspected spies. There was no immediate comment on the Iranian allegations by the CIA or U.S. officials.    Iran announced in June that it had broken up an alleged CIA spy ring but it was unclear whether Monday’s announcement was linked to the same case.  The announcement comes after three months of spiraling confrontation between Iran and the West that began when new tighter U.S. sanctions took effect in May.  Last week Iran captured a British tanker after Britain’s Royal Marines seized an Iranian tanker on July 4. In a statement read on state television, the Ministry of Intelligence said 17 spies were arrested during the Iranian calendar year that ended in March 2019.  “The identified spies were employed in sensitive and vital private sector centers in the economic, nuclear, infrastructure, military and cyber areas... where they collected classified information,” read the ministry statement. In a separate report, the semi-official Fars news agency quoted a Ministry of Intelligence official as saying some of those arrested had been sentenced to death.

It suggested imposing a maximum customs duty of ₹4,000 on handsets priced above ₹20,000 to stop the practice. Currently, a basic customs duty of 20% is imposed on imported handsets.",The Financial Express,"Sale of high-end mobile phones in the grey market is causing an estimated loss of Rs 2,500 crore annually to the exchequer, mobile industry body India Cellular and Electronics Association has claimed. The industry body has suggested imposing a maximum customs duty of Rs 4,000 on handsets priced above Rs 20,000 to discourage duty evasion and wipe out the premium for illegal sales. A basic customs duty (BCD) of 20 per cent is imposed on imported handsets at present.“High-end phones that are getting sold in the grey market are estimated to cause a loss of Rs 2,500 crore annually on account of non-payment of basic customs duty (BCD) and also goods and services tax,” India Cellular and Electronics Association (ICEA) Chairman Pankaj Mohindroo told PTI.The industry body has requested Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman that the BCD of 20 per cent should continue but with a cap of Rs 4,000 on mobile phones priced above Rs 20,000, Mohindroo said. The step will wipe out high margins on the illegal sale of high-end handsets and give a boost to legal imports, the ICEA has reasoned.“Revenue impact on this would be an additional duty of Rs 700 crore of BCD approximately, which will get netted off because of the reduction in duty on the legal import. Hence, there will be no net gain or net loss. The GST collection will, however, go up by over Rs 1,000 crore and the market environment will become much cleaner and regularised,” Mohindroo said.The ICEA said that recent budget was focussed on promoting electronics manufacturing in the country with a provision to write off capital expenditure for under section of 35 AD of Income Tax act.“The entire mobile phone and its components manufacturing ecosystem should be brought under the finally notified scheme,” he said.The industry body has requested the government to bring down GST on mobile phone parts to 12 per cent from 18 per cent at present as it is creating an inverted duty structure in the sector.The GST on mobile phones is 12 per cent while 18 per cent on parts such as back covers, batteries, headphones etc. Mohindroo said that the inverted duty structure has led to a serious cash flow issue for manufacturers and is adversely impacting the competitiveness of locally-produced mobile phones.India had two mobile phone factories in 2014 but now, it has 268 factories engaged in the manufacturing of mobile phones and their accessories. Prime Minister Narendra Modi during his 13th India-Japan annual summit had announced making India top mobile phone manufacturing destination.Though there is a mechanism in GST to provide a refund of input tax credit (ITC), there is no way to provide a refund of accumulated ITC on the GST paid on capital goods and services in case of inverted structure. “All new manufacturers are investing heavily on Capex (capital expenditure) and business promotion for creating a brand image. GST on such expense is an additional cost to the manufacturer, as they are not allowed refund of such accumulated credit,” Mohindroo said.The ICEA has urged the finance minister to reduce timeframe for refund of GST credits to at most a week. The industry body has also demanded input credit on manufacturing plant or shed, and canteen service, among others.Get live Stock Prices from BSE and NSE and latest NAV, portfolio of Mutual Funds, calculate your tax by Income Tax Calculator, know market’s Top Gainers, Top Losers & Best Equity Funds.

Why our ancestors did not go to Pakistan? They regarded India as their own country. Now they will be punished and they will have to endure,” adding that the Muslims of this country had been living a very “disgusting life”.Naqvi’s statement’s was criticised by senior Congress leader Randeep Surjewala who accused the BJP of protecting the accused.Quoting Surjewala, India Today reported, “BJP doesn’t feel anything for the minorities. Everyone in the ruling party is trying to shield the culprits.”Since 2015, 98 people have been victims of mob lynchings across India.

The incident occurred when the three were caught red-handed stealing cattle. It resulted in angry villagers beating them up leading to their deaths.

101,Agencies gave IL&FS good ratings despite stress flags: Audit,"A Grant Thornton audit into debt-laden IL&FS Group revealed that rating agencies despite flagging financial stress before its default, continued to give it and its units ""consistently high"" credit ratings. It said officials of agencies including ICRA, CARE, Brickwork and India Ratings, were possibly given gifts like smartwatches and overseas sports event tickets to influence the ratings.",Reuters,"MUMBAI/NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Credit rating agencies for years assigned high ratings to India’s Infrastructure Leasing & Financial Services (IL&FS) and its group companies despite its deteriorating finances, according to a special audit. Audit firm Grant Thornton was appointed by IL&FS’ new board to conduct the review following the government’s decision to take charge of the group after its defaults on debt obligations sparked fears of financial contagion.  Grant Thornton reviewed the role of five credit rating agencies — Fitch group’s India Ratings and Research, the Indian affiliate of Moody’s, ICRA, Standard & Poor’s local unit Crisil, CARE Ratings and Brickwork Ratings India — which assigned 429 ratings to various IL&FS financial instruments in recent years. In a 105-page report, reviewed by Reuters on Saturday, Grant Thornton said the agencies raised multiple concerns on IL&FS group’s financial stress and liquidity position between June 2012 and June 2018, but continued to assign “consistently high” ratings which were only downgraded or reversed last year. “Various strategies deployed by the then key officials of IL&FS group and certain favours/gifts provided to rating agency officials suggest the possible reasons for consistent good ratings provided to IL&FS group,” said Grant Thornton in its report that detailed gifts or favours such as smartwatches and tickets to overseas sporting events.  IL&FS declined to comment. India Ratings said the Grant Thornton report is based on “partial and selective source material”, adding “our ratings were based on robust and transparent analysis of relevant information”. Brickwork said it did not assign the highest ratings to IL&FS “because it follows robust, transparent and consistent rating methodology” and its actions were not influenced by any commercial pressures or rating withdrawal requests. ICRA said it will determine an appropriate course of action and was examining the report, which it said ignores the “alleged fraud perpetrated by former IL&FS management”. Crisil and CARE did not immediately respond to a request for comment.     The IL&FS crisis that started last year has sparked a series of federal probes into the firm’s operations, but Grant Thornton’s report raises questions on whether rating agencies misled investors about the stress levels at other companies in India’s shadow banking sector, where new fractures are emerging. Dewan Housing Finance Corp, another top firm in the sector, last week warned its financial situation was dire, raising more worries about the sector’s health and signalling the crisis was far from over. “These instances show a glimpse into the incestuous financial services industry where quid pro quo has become the norm. The rot ... is deep and needs more cleansing,” said Shriram Subramanian, a corporate governance expert at proxy advisory firm InGovern.  Grant Thornton’s review of communication between former IL&FS employees and ratings agencies found the company at times “used to potentially pressurize” rating firms to withdraw their assessment if the company did not receive a favourable rating. It also found instances where credit rating agencies would meet with IL&FS employees and then decide not to downgrade the ratings they had initially decided on, the report said. “It appears that various potential strategies noted above were applied to ensure favorable ratings or to avoid the rating downgrade,” Grant Thornton said. Highlighting “potential favours/gifts”, Grant Thornton said various key officials at rating agencies received gifts such as smartwatches, shirts and coasters. E-mail communication showed a former IL&FS employee had facilitated the purchase of a villa at a steep discount for the wife of a senior Fitch executive, while another had arranged football tickets for a Brickwork Ratings executive to a Real Madrid game, the report added.  Brickwork said it had shared “a detailed response” on this specific allegation with IL&FS’ new management. Fitch in a statement said the employee involved had violated the agency’s code of conduct and was no longer employed. India’s market regulator has toughened regulations for credit rating agencies over the past three years to boost monitoring and bring clarity for investors.

""It was a lovely tweet. That was sarcasm. It was timely,"" he said. Further, talking about not selecting Rayudu in 2019 World Cup squad, Prasad said, ""Due to certain combinations, he wasn't picked. It doesn't make Selection Committee biased.""",CricTracker,"Ambati Rayudu even without featuring in the Indian team that played the World Cup 2019 has made more news than most other players. When he was not included in the primary squad but named as a back-up he put out the famous 3D tweet. Later when the selectors had to name replacement players, Rayudu was still not included and it was said that the reason could’ve been his tweet. However, selector MSK Prasad disagrees.When Prasad announced the India squads for West Indies tour, he was asked about Rayudu who retired from all forms of the sport after the snubs. He clarified that the selection committee was only making replacement changes based on the team management’s requirements and on that basis he didn’t find a place. There was no sort of bias in the decision-making and that they too got emotional as Rayudu retired.AdvertisementThe chairman of selectors also mentioned that they had brought Rayudu in the ODI team based on his T20I performance amidst criticism and gave him enough opportunities to cement a spot. Moving forward based on his performance and the combination of the team he couldn’t be included in the World Cup squad.They persisted with him even after the middle-order batsman failed the yo-yo test. He was put on a fitness program at the NCA and they made sure he cleared it at the next go to be a part of the Indian team.“There was criticism when we picked Rayudu after his 2017-18 T20 form. When he failed the fitness test, we backed him. Due to some combinations and permutations, we didn’t pick him for the World Cup. We didn’t do anything against him,” MSK said.Rayudu’s 3D tweet got really popular and also proved to be meme material. The common perception was that the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) officials, the team management as well as the selectors were not happy with his tweet. The Hyderabadi was one of the few Indian players who ever questioned their selection or non-selection on social media or a public platform.However, Prasad said that he saw humour in the tweet and really enjoyed the sarcasm in it since it was timely.“Ambati Rayudu tweet was lovely.

107,Umpire who gave England 6 overthrows in WC final admits it was a mistake,"Umpire Kumar Dharmasena has admitted that awarding England six overthrows instead of five in final over of 2019 World Cup final was a mistake. ""I agree...there was a judgmental error when I see it on TV replays now. But we didn't have luxury of TV replays at the ground,"" he said. He further said that he'll never regret the decision.",CricTracker,"It’s been a week since the 2019 World Cup final has finished but many are still busy discussing the game. Undoubtedly, it was the best ODI game ever played and irrespective of the result, both England and New Zealand should be proud of themselves for the effort they put in. But some crunch moments decided the game eventually and one of them was the umpire Kumar Dharmasena awarding six runs to England in the last over of the chase when the ball ricocheted off Ben Stokes’ bat.The incident took place in the final over when the home team needed nine runs off three balls and the Kiwis almost had the World Cup trophy in the bag. The batsman swatted the ball to deep mid-wicket and set off for two runs. While taking the second run, Stokes dived to avoid getting run-out only for his bat to deflect the ball to the boundary.AdvertisementThe on-field umpires consulted then to give England six runs when actually five runs should’ve signalled. According to the cricketing laws, the two batsmen should’ve crossed each other when the fielder threw the ball and Stokes and Adil Rashid hadn’t crossed when Martin Guptill fired in a throw. It was considered as a clear mistake by the former international umpire Simon Taufel.Speaking about the controversial call to a Sri Lankan publication the Sunday Times, Kumar Dharmasena has cleared that he has no regrets about the decision he made regarding the overthrow. However, he also admitted that they made a judgemental error in the middle.“It’s easy for people to comment after seeing TV replays. I agree that there was a judgmental error when I see it on TV replays now. But we did not have the luxury of TV replays at the ground and I will never regret the decision I made. Besides, the ICC praised me for the decision I made at that time,” he said.Dharmasena also cleared that he communicated to the leg umpire Marais Erasmus before making the decision and even the other umpires agreed to give six runs to England. “There is no provision in the law to refer this to the third umpire as no dismissal was involved. So, I did consult the leg umpire through the communication system which is heard by all other umpires and the match referee.“And, while they cannot check TV replays, they all confirmed that the batsmen have completed the run.

112,British finance minister says he will resign if Boris becomes PM,"British finance minister Philip Hammond has said he will resign from the post if Boris Johnson becomes Prime Minister. ""Assuming that Boris Johnson becomes Prime Minister, I understand that his conditions for serving in his government would include accepting a no-deal Brexit on the 31st of October. That is not something I could ever sign up to,"" Hammond added.",Reuters,"LONDON (Reuters) - British finance minister Philip Hammond said on Sunday he would resign if Boris Johnson became prime minister because he felt unable to support a leader happy to take the country out of the European Union without a deal. Hammond’s decision underlines the strength of feeling in parliament against a no-deal Brexit, which some lawmakers and many businesses say would be catastrophic for the economy. A loyal Conservative who has served in a number of ministerial roles, Hammond is an unlikely rebel. He said his fears over a no deal forced him to vote against the government for the first time in his 22-year political career last week. Britain’s new prime minister is tipped to be former London mayor Johnson, who has promised to leave the EU “do or die” by an Oct. 31 deadline. That leaves him facing a tricky Brexit challenge from the moment he would take office on Wednesday. Johnson has said he would ramp up preparations for a no deal to try to force the EU’s negotiators to make changes to the agreement that Prime Minister Theresa May sealed with Brussels and UK lawmakers voted down three times.  But parliamentary opposition to a no deal is growing and the EU is refusing to budge over that withdrawal agreement. “I am sure I am not going to be sacked because I am going to resign before we get to that point,” Hammond told the BBC’s Andrew Marr Show, adding he would resign to May before she tendered her own resignation to the Queen on Wednesday. “Assuming that Boris Johnson becomes prime minister, I understand that his conditions for serving in his government would include accepting a no-deal (EU) exit on the 31st of October. That is not something I could ever sign up to.” Johnson has said his most senior ministers “would have to be reconciled” with the possibility of a no-deal Brexit on Oct. 31, a departure he does not want to see happen, but one he says must be planned for to try to increase pressure on the EU. That stance means several more ministers who want to leave with a deal may seek to quit before facing the prospect of being sacked by Johnson. Justice minister David Gauke has indicated he will also step down on Wednesday, and some lawmakers say they expect more pro-EU Conservatives to leave their positions to hold talks in parliament to find a way to prevent a no deal. Keir Starmer, Brexit policy chief in the main opposition Labour Party, said on Twitter he respected Hammond’s decision. “I want to work with all those MPs (members of parliament) who, like me, want to ensure parliament can stop a disastrous no-deal exit,” Starmer said. Hammond’s intention to resign led Ian Blackford, the Westminster leader of the Scottish National Party, to predict that Johnson could become “the shortest serving prime minister in history”. Hammond, who according to sources close to Johnson often infuriated the former mayor who felt the finance minister was “talking Britain down”, said he did not believe his former colleague could win a deal with the EU by the deadline.  He instead advised the new prime minister to ask the EU for a little longer if there were signs that the two sides could agree on a compromise position - something Johnson’s rival for the premiership, Jeremy Hunt, has said he is open to. But the EU has so far been steadfast in its view that it cannot open the withdrawal agreement, and Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney said both sides would be “in trouble” if the new prime minister was intent on tearing up the deal. He suggested the new leader could secure changes to the political declaration on future ties to get rid of the Northern Irish backstop - an insurance policy to avoid the return of a hard border between the British province and Ireland. “We hope that the backstop that many in the UK don’t seem to like can be avoided,” Coveney told the BBC. “(But) we are simply not going to move away from that withdrawal agreement.” Johnson and his supporters say the hardline stance is little more than a negotiating ploy. But if the standoff failed to be broken and a no deal Brexit was in the offing, Hammond would become a high-profile backer of attempts in parliament to stop a no deal. “Yes, (I will campaign) to stop no deal happening on Oct. 31 without the consent of parliament,” Hammond said. “I want to be a loyal supporter of the next Conservative government and if (it).. can deliver a negotiated Brexit deal that protects our economy then I will strongly support that government. And I hope I will be able to.” Reporting by Elizabeth Piper; editing by John Stonestreet",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-britain-eu-hammond/uk-finance-minister-hammond-to-resign-on-wednesday-over-no-deal-brexit-idUSKCN1UG0B4?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

Thor: Love and Thunder will star Chris Hemsworth and Tessa Thompson and will mark the return of Thor's love interest Dr Jane Foster played by Natalie Portman. The twist in the tale is that Jane Foster will be seen worthy of lifting Mjolnir in Thor: Love and Thunder and will take the mantle of Thor. The plot device is based on the recent comic book storyline where Thor loses his powers and Jane Foster is deemed worthy. At the Comic-Con panel, director Taika Waititi called Natalie on stage and handed her the Mjolnir in the presence of Chris Hemsworth, Tessa Thompson and thousands of fans. He said, ""That storyline is incredible is full emotion, love and thunder and introduces for the first time female Thor"".Lifting the Mjolnir, Natalie was heard saying, ""I’ve always had hammer envy"".

Britain said that Iran's action constitutes ""illegal interference"". ""The ship was exercising the lawful right of transit passage in an international strait as provided for under international law,"" Britain wrote.",Reuters,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Britain told the United Nations Security Council on Saturday that a British-flagged tanker seized by Iran was approached by Iranian forces when it was in Omani territorial waters and the action “constitutes illegal interference.” “The ship was exercising the lawful right of transit passage in an international strait as provided for under international law,” Britain’s U.N. mission wrote to the Security Council. “International law requires that the right of transit passage shall not be impeded, and therefore the Iranian action constitutes illegal interference.” The letter, seen by Reuters, was also sent to U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres. Friday’s action in the global oil trade’s most important waterway has been viewed in the West as a major escalation after three months of confrontation that has already taken Iran and the United States to the brink of war. It follows threats from Tehran to retaliate for Britain’s seizure on July 4 of the Iranian tanker Grace 1, accused of violating sanctions on Syria. “Current tensions are extremely concerning, and our priority is to de-escalate. We do not seek confrontation with Iran,” the letter read. “But it is unacceptable and highly escalatory to threaten shipping going about its legitimate business through internationally recognized transit corridors.” Britain called on Iran to release the Stena Impero tanker and told the Security Council it was working to resolve the issue through diplomatic means.

The video shows speedboats pulling up alongside the tanker, and troops wearing ski masks and carrying machine guns being lowered onto its deck from a helicopter. The same tactics were used by British Royal Marines to seize an Iranian oil tanker two weeks ago.",Reuters,"GENEVA/LONDON (Reuters) - Britain on Saturday denounced Iran’s seizure of a British-flagged oil tanker in the Gulf as a “hostile act” and rejected Tehran’s explanation that it seized the vessel because it had been involved in an accident. Iran’s Revolutionary Guards posted a video online showing speedboats pulling alongside the Stena Impero tanker, its name clearly visible. Troops wearing ski masks and carrying machine guns rappelled to its deck from a helicopter, the same tactics used by British Royal Marines to seize an Iranian tanker off the coast of Gibraltar two weeks ago. Friday’s action in the global oil trade’s most important waterway has been viewed in the West as a major escalation after three months of confrontation that has already taken Iran and the United States to the brink of war. It follows threats from Tehran to retaliate for Britain’s July 4 seizure of the Iranian tanker Grace 1, accused of violating sanctions on Syria. British Defence Secretary Penny Mordaunt called the incident a “hostile act”. Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt said he had expressed “extreme disappointment” by phone to his Iranian counterpart, Mohammad Javad Zarif. Britain also summoned the Iranian charge d’affaires in London. A spokesman for Iran’s Revolutionary Guards, Brigadier-General Ramezan Sharif, said Tehran had seized the ship in the Strait of Hormuz despite the “resistance and interference” of a British warship which had been escorting it. No British warship was visible in the video posted by the Guards. Iran’s Fars news agency said the Guards had taken control of the Stena Impero on Friday after it collided with an Iranian fishing boat whose distress call it ignored. The vessel, carrying no cargo, was taken to the Iranian port of Bandar Abbas. It will remain there with its 23 crew - 18 of them Indians - while the accident is investigated, Iranian news agencies quoted the head of Ports and Maritime Organisation in southern Hormozgan province, Allahmorad Afifipour, as saying. In a letter to the U.N. Security Council, Britain said the tanker was approached by Iranian forces when it was in Omani territorial waters exercising its lawful right of passage, and the action “constitutes illegal interference.” “Current tensions are extremely concerning, and our priority is to de-escalate. We do not seek confrontation with Iran,” the letter said. “But it is unacceptable and highly escalatory to threaten shipping going about its legitimate business through internationally recognized transit corridors.” Zarif told Hunt that the ship must go through a legal process before it can be released, Iran’s ISNA news agency reported. The strait, between Iran and the Arabian peninsula, is the sole outlet for exports of most Middle Eastern oil, and the seizure sent oil prices sharply higher. The United States, which tightened sanctions against Iran in May with the aim of halting its oil exports altogether, has been warning for months of an Iranian threat to shipping in the strait. U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said he also discussed the situation with Hunt, his British counterpart. “We talked about what they’ve seen, what they know, and how they’re beginning to think about how they will respond,” Pompeo said in an interview with the Washington Examiner that was published on Saturday by the State Department. “Iran is in a place today that they have taken themselves.” Another oil tanker, the Mesdar, was also boarded by Iranian personnel on Friday and temporarily forced to divert toward Iran, but later was allowed to continue on its route through the strait. On Saturday Algeria’s APS news agency said the Mesdar was owned by Algeria’s state oil company Sonatrach. France, Germany and the European Union joined Britain in condemning the seizure. The three big European countries are signatories to a 2015 nuclear deal between Tehran and world powers that Washington undermined by quitting last year, setting Iran’s already fragile relations with the West on a downward spiral. Under the pact, Iran agreed to restrict nuclear work in return for lifting sanctions. The European countries opposed the Trump administration’s decision to abandon the agreement last year, but have so far failed to fulfill promises to Iran of providing alternative means for it to access world trade. “Just spoke to ... Zarif and expressed extreme disappointment that having assured me last Saturday Iran wanted to de-escalate situation, they have behaved in the opposite way,” Hunt wrote on Twitter. “This has to be about actions not words if we are to find a way through.”  Earlier he said London’s reaction would be “considered but robust” and it would ensure the safety of its shipping. On Friday, Hunt said the solution would be found via diplomacy and London was “not looking at military options.” Britain’s government said it had advised British shipping to stay out of the Hormuz area for an interim period. During the past three months of escalation, the United States and Iran come as close as ever to direct armed conflict. In June, Tehran shot down a U.S. drone and President Donald Trump ordered retaliatory air strikes, only to call them off just minutes before were to have been carried out. The vessel had been heading to a port in Saudi Arabia and suddenly changed course after passing through the strait. The United States has blamed Iran for a series of attacks on shipping around the Strait of Hormuz. Tehran has rejected the allegations. Washington also said it had this week downed an Iranian drone near where the Stena Impero was seized.  The United States is sending military personnel and resources to Saudi Arabia for the first time since the U.S. invasion of Iraq in 2003.

142,US-S Korea military exercise to proceed despite N Korea's warning,"The secretary for peace planning to South Korean President Moon Jae-in, Jong Kun Choi, has said a US-South Korean military exercise would go ahead as planned next month. This comes despite North Korea's warning that the exercise will put talks aimed at getting the country to abandon its nuclear weapons at risk. ""The nature of exercise isn't offensive,"" Choi said.",Reuters,"ASPEN, Colo. (Reuters) - A top South Korean official on Saturday said a U.S.-South Korean military exercise would go ahead as planned next month, denying Pyongyang’s charges that holding it would breach an agreement made between U.S. President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. “The nature of the exercise is not offensive ... and is for strengthening the alliance,” Choi Jong-kun, the secretary for peace planning to South Korean President Moon Jae-in, told the Aspen Institute’s annual strategic forum. Later, speaking with Reuters, Choi said next month’s exercise would largely involve computer simulations and not troops in the field. The spokesman for North Korea’s Foreign Ministry said on Tuesday that Trump had reaffirmed in a meeting with Kim last month that joint exercises would be halted adding that the U.S. decision to proceed with them was “clearly a breach” of the leaders’ agreements made at a summit in Singapore last year. The spokesman said proceeding with war games was jeopardizing Pyongyang’s resumption of nuclear talks with the United States. The ministry said Washington’s pattern of “unilaterally reneging on its commitments” was leading Pyongyang to its commitment to discontinue tests of nuclear weapons and intercontinental ballistic missiles. U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo rejected the North Korean charges earlier this week. Speaking to the Aspen conference, Choi said that the United States would have consulted with his government had Trump agreed to suspend U.S.-South Korean war games during his talks last month with Kim on the border last month. “As far as I know, President Trump did not promise the cancellation of this upcoming military exercise,” said Choi. “If he had done that ... we would have been consulted and organized it and used it very strategically.” He noted that the United States and South Korea had suspended a large-scale exercise and canceled a second following the Singapore summit in June 2018 at which Trump sought to persuade Kim to end the development of nuclear weapons and eliminate his arsenal.  A second Trump-Kim summit in February failed to make any headway. The following month, the U.S. and South Korean militaries announced they were scaling back major war games - which Pyongyang long has denounced as preparations for war - and would hold smaller-scale exercises. Even so, Choi said, the preparedness of the U.S. and South Korean military to operate together had not been waned. “For the record, military interoperability has never been compromised,” he said.

The attack in Dera Ismail Khan early on Sunday was claimed by Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan, often known as the Pakistani Taliban, which is separate from the insurgent movement across the border in Afghanistan. Local officials said the attack happened after two police were killed at a roadside checkpoint outside the city. “When their bodies were taken to the main hospital, a suicide bomber, believed to be a female, wearing a burqa, triggered an explosive-laden jacket and caused huge losses,” said Waqar Ahmad, a local police officer.

Police late on Saturday issued an arrest warrant for 41-year-old Shinji Aoba, suspected of causing Japan’s worst mass killing in two decades on Thursday when he went to the studio in western Japan, poured fuel around the entrance and shouted “Die” as he set the building ablaze, according to public broadcaster NHK. They plan to arrest Aoba, who suffered serious burns and on Saturday was airlifted to a university hospital for treatment, once he recovers, NHK said.  Police said Aoba had previously been convicted of robbing a shop. Aoba lived alone on the ground floor of a two-floor apartment building on the outskirts of Omiya, a commuter suburb of Tokyo and some 500 km (310 miles) east of Kyoto. His next-door neighbour recalled Aoba as pudgy and unkempt, with blemished skin. He kept odd hours and barely spoke to anyone.  “I’ve never seen him go out during the day, not even to the convenience store. I would regularly hear him go out around midnight,” the neighbour, a 27-year-old man who declined to be identified, told Reuters. Music from video games blared from Aoba’s apartment at all hours, the neighbour said, adding that there had been complaints from residents about the noise in the last year. On July 14, days before the attack, Aoba grabbed and threatened the neighbour over an apparent misunderstanding. It started when Aoba began pounding on the wall to complain about noise, the neighbour said. When the neighbour went to Aoba’s front door to tell him the noise was coming from another unit, he heard a loud wail inside the apartment and then the door opened. “When he came out of his apartment, his eyes were bloodshot, and he started yelling at me to my face to shut up,” the neighbour said. “He grabbed me by the collar and started pulling my hair. It was terrifying.” After the Kyoto attack, Aoba told police he had done it because the studio had plagiarised his novel, Kyodo news reported. Kyoto Animation is well known in Japan and abroad for its series and movies, including “Violet Evergarden”, which has been on Netflix.  Aoba had lived in the Omiya apartment for about three years, the neighbour said. Japanese media said he had moved into it at some point following his release from his prison for robbing a convenience store east of Tokyo in 2012. He had also received care for mental illness, NHK said. The apartment block is typical of the prefab apartments that crowd Japanese commuter suburbs: small, identical units, built with thin walls. Single air conditioners rest on narrow balconies outside each unit. The apartments are usually meant for single occupants and are popular with lower-income and younger workers.   Residents in the area - a rural subdivision off a busy road where recently built homes and unkempt vegetable patches fight for space with a tiny cemetery - said they were shocked by the news of the arson. “I’ve lived here all my life, and until very recently, this area has never had any incidents of violence, or talk of violent people living in the neighbourhood,” said an engineer in his 20s en route to visit his parents who live near Aoba’s apartment. “It’s unsettling.”  Reporting by Naomi Tajitsu; Editing by David Dolan and Clare Fallon",https://in.reuters.com/article/japan-fire-suspect-idINKCN1UF0D8?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=5d3341adb9415600019b1334&utm_source=inshorts

169,Indian utilities' coal imports in 2019 first half rise over 53%,"Coal imports by Indian coal utilities during the first half of 2019 rose 53.4% from a year earlier to 35.47 million tonnes, government data showed. Imports for power plants at Gujarat's Mundra made up 42% of all imports by Indian utilities during the first six months. Imports by Adani Power's Mundra plant more than quadrupled to 9.01 million tonnes.",Reuters,"NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Coal imports by Indian coal utilities during the first half of 2019 rose 53.4% from a year earlier to 35.47 million tonnes, data provided by India’s Central Electricity Authority (CEA) showed. Demand for seaborne coal imports in India has risen because of a fast rising population and the unavailability of alternative fuels such as natural gas. Imports for power plants at the port of Mundra, in western India’s state of Gujarat, made up 42% of all imports by Indian utilities during the first half of 2019. Imports by Adani Power Ltd’s  Mundra plant more than quadrupled from a year earlier to 9.01 million tonnes, while coal shipments by Tata Power Ltd’s utility rose over 6% to 6.07 million tonnes. The utilities have been ramping up imports of thermal coal after India’s top court in October eased their earlier stance and paved the way for passing on increased generation costs to consumers. The power plants were forced to cut imports and slash electricity generation after the court barred them from increasing prices for customers in 2016, after their coal supplier Indonesia raised the price of coal. NTPC Ltd, India’s largest electricity generator, shipped in 1.4 million tonnes of coal to various ports during six months ended June 2019, about 11 times of what it imported a year ago. Coal is among the top five commodities imported by India, and about three-fifths of its thermal coal imports come from Indonesia, while less than one-sixth is imported from South Africa. Thermal coal imports rose at the fastest pace in four years in 2018, after two straight years of decline. Indian utilities are importing more as the government has failed to open the industry to competition because bureaucratic indecision and resistance from unions has stalled the passage of a liberalization policy approved by the country’s cabinet 16 months ago. Higher Indian coal imports are a boon for international miners such as Indonesia’s Adaro Energy, U.S. coal miner Peabody Energy Corp and global commodity merchants such as Glencore PLC. They also undercut efforts by Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government to cut imports and place additional burdens on India’s debt-ridden thermal power sector.

190,India may engage foreign lenders for loans to small firms,"The government is reportedly in talks with foreign lenders to provide as much as ₹1 lakh crore in credit to the country's small enterprises. It is in discussions with multiple foreign lenders, including Germany's state-owned development bank KfW Group, the World Bank and some Canadian institutions. World Bank has said the discussions with the government were in the early stages.",Reuters,"NEW DELHI (Reuters) - The government is in talks with foreign lenders to provide as much as $14.5 billion in credit to millions of its small firms, two officials said, in a sign the country’s banking system may not be robust enough to do the job on its own. The government is in discussions with multiple foreign lenders, including Germany’s state-owned development bank KfW Group, the World Bank and some Canadian institutions to extend lines of credit to small enterprises, one of the officials, who did not want to be identified, told Reuters. KfW’s India office confirmed the discussions, though the main focus was on credit lines to support small businesses’ solar power generation. The talks were at an early stage, KfW said. A spokesman for World Bank in India on Saturday said the discussions with the government were in the early stages, adding that “further rounds of consultations will help us define the contours of this collaboration”. The official said the government plans to source up to 1 trillion Indian rupees of loans from foreign institutions because Indian banks were not in a position to provide enough capital for the small business sector, which is seen as critical to job creation. “We are exploring, we are having discussions with various funding agencies if something can be done (for small and medium firms),” the second official said. The officials did not provide full details of the discussions they are having with banks, or identify all those they are talking to, but said talks are at a very early stage. India’s micro, small and medium enterprise (MSME) ministry is discussing the proposal to pull in foreign banks with the country’s ministry of finance, which will make a final call, the second official said. The push for foreign loans comes on the heels of the Indian government’s announcement earlier this month that it plans to borrow about 700 billion rupees by issuing overseas sovereign bonds. India’s 63 million firms in the micro, small and medium firm sector are responsible for more than a quarter of the country’s manufacturing and services output, and must be re-energised for Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government to kick-start the economy.  Gross domestic product growth fell to a five-year low of 5.8% in the January-March quarter, well below the 8%-plus rates that the government is targeting. But credit availability for small and medium firms, which also account for about 45% of India’s total exports, has worsened due to a liquidity crisis in the country’s shadow banking industry that has seen big lenders struggling to remain solvent.   State-owned banks, which dominate the sector, have not been able to drive increased lending because they are burdened with more than $145 billion in bad loans. This has led to a severe credit squeeze for smaller firms. They pay up to 17% annual interest on loans from banks, while the shadow banks, which are also known as non-banking financial companies (NBFCS) can charge as much as 20%. Last month, a study by a Reserve Bank of India panel said the overall deficit in credit for the MSME sector is estimated at about 20 trillion rupees to 25 trillion rupees.     But lending to such firms can be risky as some lack proper financial information, such as historical cash flow data, which makes it challenging for banks to assess the credit risks. To mitigate such risks for foreign banks, the loans would be given sovereign guarantees and be routed through Indian government agencies such as the Small Industries Development Bank of India, the first official said.

PM's Economic Advisory Council argued that Subramanian overlooked taxation data in his earlier analysis. In a follow-up paper, he argued real growth in direct taxes fell from 14.3% pre-2011 to 3.7% during the post-2011 period.",Livemint,"New Delhi: Former chief economic adviser in the finance ministry Arvind Subramanian, in a follow-up GDP paper, has given further evidence that real GDP growth in the post-2011 period may have been overestimated by 2.5 percentage points, as argued in his earlier paper.Countering the contention of prime minister’s economic advisory council (PMEAC) that growth could not have declined since India’s tax-GDP ratio rose in the post-2011 period, Subramanian in his latest GDP paper has argued that real growth in direct taxes actually fell from 14.3% pre-2011 period to 3.7% during post-2011 period.PMEAC had argued that Subramanian had overlooked taxation data in his earlier analysis. ""While selecting 17 indicators, the author chooses to overlook tax data. Unlike many indicators, tax data is not collected through surveys or by agencies through arcane techniques, these are hard numbers and should be an important indicator of growth. Further, there have been no major changes in tax laws until the end period in the author’s analysis (31st March 2017). GST was introduced on 1st July 2017. The author’s logic of not using tax data appears to be a convenient argument meant to avoid inconvenient conclusions based on hard facts,"" the council had said.Subramanian in his initial paper had said he is not using tax indicators because of the major changes in direct and indirect taxes in the post-2011 period which render the tax-to-GDP relationship different and unstable, and hence make the indicators unreliable proxies for GDP growth.To counter the PMEAC argument without naming it, Subramanian in his follow-up paper has analysed the tax data.""Another counter-argument is that growth could not have declined, since India’s tax-GDP ratio rose in the post-2011 period, from about 10% in 2011-12 to 11% in 2016-17. After all, revenue performance tends to be pro-cyclical, so rising revenue-GDP ratios tend to suggest surging growth,"" Subramanian observed.Subramanian said much cannot be inferred about GDP growth from indirect taxes since after international oil prices fell, the government raised excises on petroleum sharply, which increased revenues and hence the petroleum tax-GDP ratio by about 0.8 percentage points of GDP between 2011-12 and 2016-17.However, when he analysed trends in direct taxes, he found nominal taxes grew at about 22% pre-2011 and dropped sharply to 11.5%, post-2011; the corresponding real growth numbers are 14.3% and 3.7%. ""So, the sharp decline in real direct tax growth is striking,"" he said.""Again, we must be careful here because a lot could have changed by way of tax rates and enforcement to explain the change. But sharply declining real direct tax growth is more likely to be consistent with declining real GDP growth. Indeed, the slow pace of real direct tax growth during 2012-16 seems consistent with a real GDP growth rate of 4.5%,"" he concluded.Subramanian also checked by examining whether other countries have managed to achieve 7% GDP growth, over any 5 year period, with India’s post-2011 combination of investment and export growth (3% for both). ""We went back to 1980 and identified 69 country-year experiences where the average growth rate over 5 consecutive years was between 6.5% and 7.5%. The answer is: none. Indeed, the median combination of investment and exports necessary to achieve 7% growth is 11.8% and 9.8%, respectively, more than three times India’s performance on. So, historical evidence from other countries does cast doubt on the post-2011 GDP growth estimates,"" he said in his latest paper.Subramanian also claimed that he analysed over 28 countries since 1980 where both investment and export growth rate are close to or above India’s combination of 3.2% and 3%, respectively.""No country case ever achieved any growth greater than 5.5%, consistent with our result that the 95% confidence interval is below 5.5%. Four countries in this sample achieved growth averaging 4.9%, but the median growth was only 3.22%. So, if India were a typical country with typical relationships between investment, exports and GDP growth, its GDP growth would be closer to 3-3.5%,"" he concluded.",https://www.livemint.com/news/india/arvind-subramanian-counters-pmeac-criticism-through-new-gdp-paper-1563515584032.html?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

She was admitted to Fortis Escorts Heart Institute on Saturday morning in a critical state due to a cardiac problem.Sheila Dikshit was the chief minister of Delhi for 15 years and possibly one of the longest-serving chief ministers of the Congress.Read Sheila Dikshit's last interview to MintFortis Escorts Heart Institute said in a statement that Dikshit was brought to the hospital in a critical condition with cardiac arrest.“A multi-disciplinary team of doctors, led by Dr Ashok Seth, chairman, Fortis Escorts Heart Institute, carried out advanced resuscitative measures.

However, she had another cardiac arrest and despite all resuscitative efforts, passed away at 3:55pm,"" the statement said.The 80-year-old Congress leader had undergone heart surgery in France last year. Dr Seth had advised that the procedure be performed at the University Hospital in Lille, France, under the care of Dr Thomas Modine.Sources said Dikshit was undergoing treatment at Fortis Escorts hospital under the supervision of Dr Seth for the past few years. She had undergone angioplasty in November 2012 and was also treated for infection some time ago.Dikshit had played a decisive role in the three-term Congress government in Delhi. She had managed to defeat the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) for consecutive terms, but lost power to the Aam Aadmi Party led by Arvind Kejriwal in December 2013.The veteran politician was also defeated by Kejriwal in a straight electoral fight in the New Delhi constituency.

Her first stint as chief minister of Delhi started in 1998 when she defeated the BJP.Dikshit's entry into Indian politics was accidental and also because of her family connections. She was the daughter-in-law of late Uma Shankar Dikshit, a noted activist who had fought against the British during the independence struggle. When Uma Shankar Dikshit became a Union Cabinet minister in the Indira Gandhi government, Sheila Dikshit would often help her father-in-law.

213,Punjab CM Amarinder Singh accepts Navjot Singh Sidhu's resignation,Punjab Chief Minister Captain Amarinder Singh has accepted Navjot Singh Sidhu's resignation as a state minister. Sidhu had also sent his resignation letter dated June 10 to then-Congress President Rahul Gandhi. Punjab CM had divested Sidhu of the Local Government and Tourism and Cultural Affairs Departments and allotted him the Power and New and Renewable Energy Sources portfolios last month.,The Financial Express,"Days after Navjot Singh Sidhu resigned from the state cabinet, Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh Saturday accepted his “one-line” resignation. The chief minister has sent the resignation to Governor V P Singh Badnore for formal acceptance, an official spokesperson said here.Amarinder, who had been indisposed for the last two days, since arrival from Delhi on Wednesday, saw the resignation letter Saturday morning, the spokesperson said.The letter, however, was just a single sentence tendering Sidhu’s resignation, with no explanation or elaboration, he added.Punjab chief minister accepted Sidhu’s resignation at a time when there were speculation in the media that the Congress high command intervened in the matter for the resolution of the issue between both the leaders.The 55-year-old Sidhu, who has been at loggerheads with Amarinder, was stripped off key portfolios in the cabinet reshuffle on June 6. Punjab CM had divested Sidhu of the Local Government and Tourism and Cultural Affairs Departments and allotted him the power and new and renewable energy portfolio.Notably, apart from Sidhu, the portfolios of other ministers were also changed.The refusal to assume the charge of the power department by Sidhu for more than a month also came as an “embarrassment” to Congress with opposition parties attacking Amarinder-led regime in the state.Cricketer-turned-politician took to his Twitter handle on July 14, making public his June 10 resignation letter from the state cabinet addressed to then Congress president Rahul Gandhi, which was sent just four days after his portfolio was changed.On July 15, Sidhu has sent his resignation letter to Amarinder’s official residence here while CM was in Delhi.Amarinder on Tuesday in Delhi had said that he would decide on Sidhu’s resignation after going through the contents of the resignation letter once he reached Chandigarh. Chief Minister returned to Chandigarh Wednesday evening.Earlier this week, Amarinder in Delhi had said if Sidhu did not want to do his job, there was nothing he could do about it.In the absence of Sidhu, Amarinder has been monitoring the functioning of the power department in the wake of ongoing crucial paddy sowing season and rising power demand during hot and humid weather conditions in the state.Ever since the portfolio reshuffle exercise, Sidhu and his wife Navjot Kaur have been maintaining a distance from the media.The tension between Punjab CM and Sidhu had come out in the open in May when Amarinder blamed Sidhu for the “inept handling” of the Local Government Department, claiming that it resulted in “poor performance” of the Congress in urban areas in the Lok Sabha polls.The cricketer-turned-politician, however, had said his department was being “singled out publicly” while asserting that he could not be taken for granted as he had been a “performer throughout.”Sidhu had even approached the then Congress president Rahul Gandhi on June 9 and had “apprised him of the situation” besides handing over a letter to him.Sidhu, a former BJP leader who had joined the Congress just ahead of the 2017 Punjab assembly polls, has been at loggerheads with Amarinder for sometime now.During Lok Sabha polls, Amarinder had taken umbrage at Sidhu’s “friendly match” jibe during electioneering in Bathinda on May 17. Sidhu had allegedly cornered the Congress government in the state over the issue of the desecration of religious texts, questioning why no FIR was lodged against the Badals, who ran the previous government in the state.This had evoked sharp reaction from Amarinder. Hitting out at Sidhu, the chief minister had said, “If he was a real Congressman, he should have chosen a better time to air his grievances, instead of just ahead of voting in Punjab.”“He is harming the party with such irresponsible actions. It is not his election but that of the entire Congress,” he had said. “Perhaps he is ambitious and wants to be the chief minister,” Amarinder had said.Earlier also, the tension between Amarinder and Sidhu had come out in the public. Last year, Sidhu had said in Hyderabad, “(Congress chief) Rahul Gandhi is my captain…Rahul Gandhi is the captain of the captain (Amarinder) also.” Amarinder had also disapproved of Sidhu hugging the Pakistan Army chief during his visit to the neighbouring country.Get live Stock Prices from BSE and NSE and latest NAV, portfolio of Mutual Funds, calculate your tax by Income Tax Calculator, know market’s Top Gainers, Top Losers & Best Equity Funds.

""It's like a full-time job getting involved with Japan and South Korea. But I like leaders of both the countries,"" Trump said. The dispute threatens global supplies of memory chips and smartphones.",Reuters,"WASHINGTON/SEOUL (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump on Friday offered to help ease tensions in the political and economic dispute between Japan and South Korea, which threatens global supplies of memory chips and smartphones. Lingering tension, particularly over the issue of compensation for South Koreans forced to work for Japanese occupiers during World War Two, took a turn for the worse this month when Japan restricted exports of high-tech materials to South Korea. The United States has been hesitant to publicly wade into the feud between its two biggest allies in Asia. Trump said South Korean President Moon Jae-in had asked him if he could get involved. “He tells me that they have a lot of friction going on now with respect to trade, primarily with respect to trade. And Japan has some things that South Korea wants, and he asked me to get involved,” Trump told reporters at the White House. “So maybe if they would both want me to, I’ll be. It’s like a full-time job getting involved with Japan and South Korea. But I like both leaders.” South Korea’s presidential Blue House spokeswoman, Ko Min-jung, said in a statement on Saturday that Moon had asked Trump for help at their Seoul summit on June 30. Ko said Moon talked to Trump in an effort to diplomatically solve the issue as Japanese media, at the time, constantly reported the possibility of economic retaliation against South Korea.  David Stilwell, the top U.S. diplomat for East Asia policy, said in Seoul on Wednesday that he took the situation seriously but did not elaborate on what steps Washington might take and said it was fundamentally up to South Korea and Japan to resolve their differences. Japan has denied that the dispute over compensation is behind the export curbs, even though one of its ministers cited broken trust with South Korea over the labor dispute in announcing the restrictions. Instead, Japan has cited “inadequate management” of sensitive items exported to South Korea, with Japanese media reporting some items ended up in North Korea. South Korea has denied that. The export curbs could hurt global technology companies.

Carney has been thrust into the heart of the Brexit debate either by having to adjust monetary policy to react to it or because of criticism from some lawmakers that he is overly pessimistic about the economic risks of leaving the European Union.“It’s best a country has someone who understands the political situation within that country and knows how to navigate that,"" Rajan told the BBC. “It’s obvious I’m an outsider and I have very little understanding of the deep ebbs and flows of politics in that country.""Rajan, who now teaches at Chicago Booth School of Business and once served as chief economist of the International Monetary Fund, was recently named as the second most likely to get the BOE job by economists in a Bloomberg News survey. He trailed Andrew Bailey, the chief executive of the Financial Conduct Authority.‘Perfectly Happy’UK Chancellor of the Exchequer Philip Hammond started searching for a replacement for Carney in April and has attracted 30 applications. He met with Rajan in January, according to the Treasury, although Rajan declined to tell the BBC if he had been approached to run the central bank.“I’m perfectly happy in my job,"" he said. “I haven’t applied for any job.""Hammond, who is likely to exit the Treasury once a new prime minister takes office next week, had spoken of looking for a new governor with international experience. Former Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen also didn’t apply, a person familiar with the matter said this week.The reluctance of foreign economists to step forward may boost the chances of domestic contenders such as Bailey or current BOE officials Andrew Haldane, Jon Cunliffe, David Ramsden and Ben Broadbent. Others linked to the role include Shriti Vadera, the Santander U.K. Plc chair, and Sharon White, outgoing chief executive officer of regulator Ofcom.Gerard Lyons, a former economic adviser to Boris Johnson, the likely next prime minister, has been interviewed for the job, according to The Times.Rajan knows first hand of the political challenges of being a central banker.

231,"SpaceX Starship could go to the Moon by 2021, says Elon Musk","Billionaire Elon Musk said he thinks his aerospace startup SpaceX could land an unmanned Starship rocket on Moon in less than two years. ""Maybe within a year or two of that, we could be sending crew,"" he added. ""It may literally be easier to just land Starship on Moon than try to convince NASA that we can,"" Musk also said.",Times Now,"San Francisco: Uncrewed SpaceX Starship could land on the moon by 2021, following which, a manned moon mission could be a quick possibility, SpaceX founder Elon Musk has said. Musk's conservative estimate for sending people back to the moon aboard a SpaceX vehicle is 2023, a year before NASA hopes to send a crew to visit the moon as part of its Artemis programme, that would also include a female astronaut, CNET reported on Thursday. Earlier this year, NASA administrator Jim Bridenstine said that the space agency could consider using a third-party rocket like the SpaceX Falcon Heavy for returning to the lunar surface but later clarified that Artemis programme would use NASA's new Space Launch System.Taking cues from NASA's plans, the multi-billionaire space enthusiast believes that the quickest way back to the moon may be to ""go for it, alone"" because he knows that the process of qualifying a new spacecraft to fly NASA missions, especially involving crew, could take many months or even years.While a few key SpaceX projects are working through minor setbacks, on Tuesday a hold-down test firing of a single-engine SpaceX Starship prototype ended with an unexpected fireball. Even though the prototype did not appear to be seriously damaged, this week's plans for the so-called 'Starhopper' to lift off the ground for the first time and hover before landing were subsequently delayed, the report said. Earlier this week, Musk's SpaceX and NASA announced that the Dragon explosion was traced back to a leak in the craft's pressurisation system.  While Crew Dragon was initially set to carry its first crew this month, Musk now says that mission looks to be about six months away.Earlier this year, a SpaceX Crew Dragon spacecraft was destroyed during a test firing.  Though NASA has already tapped Crew Dragon and Boeing's Starliner craft to begin shuttling US astronauts to the International Space Station, Bridenstine told a Senate committee on Wednesday that NASA would not even have an estimate of the cost for its 2024 Artemis mission-ready until 2020.

The accused has not been charged under the non-bailable section for the offence so far.,The Financial Express,"A passenger from Jharkhand has been arrested for allegedly smoking in the lavatory of an IndiGo Airlines flight (6E 485). The man who was aboard the Ranchi-bound flight on Friday has been identified as Deepak Kumar Sharma who belongs to Jharkhand’s Hazaribagh is facing up to 3 months jail or Rs one lakh fine for the offence.This has also put a question mark on the airport security arrangement wherein the accused passenger should not have been able to pass through with a matchbox or a cigarette lighter.According to the police, the incident came to light when the smoke alarm inside the Airbus 320 aircraft which landed in Ranchi at around 2.30 pm went off, as per a report by the Hindustan Times. Sharma could possibly have to pay a penalty of up to Rs 1 lakh or spend up to three months in jail for putting the aircraft at risk, says the report.As per Section 25 of the Aircraft Act, the operator or the owner and the pilot who is in command of every aircraft registered in the country shall display a notice in the aircraft at prominent place stating where and to what extent smoking is prohibited or permitted inside the premises. Smoking is prohibited in all parts of the aircraft and in its vicinity and no person shall smoke “anywhere in an aircraft during take-off, landing or refuelling or during a period in which a notice is temporarily displayed indicating that smoking is prohibited.”At first, Sharma was detained by the Central Industrial Security Force (CISF), which is responsible for airport security. He was then taken to the airport police station where he was booked with relevant sections for smoking inside the aircraft, Senior Superintendent of Police, Patna, Garima Mallik told Hindustan Times.However, while Sharma has not been charged with the non-bailable section for the offence, it is still being considered whether he should be.

FASTag is a prepaid tag which enables automatic deduction of toll charges.",Times Now,"New Delhi: To ensure seamless traffic and prevent congestion at toll plazas, the government Friday said it has decided to declare all lanes at toll fee plaza on national highways as 'FASTag lanes' from December 1.
However, among all lanes, one 'hybrid lane' will be allowed at every toll plaza to facilitate and monitor over-dimensional or oversized vehicles, where FASTag and other modes of payment will be accepted. In a statement, the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways said this lane will also be converted into FASTag-only lane in a time-bound manner.After December 1, non-FASTag users will be charged double the fee if they pass through FASTag-only lanes. FASTag is a prepaid tag that enables automatic deduction of toll charges and lets the vehicle pass through the toll plaza without stopping for the cash transaction. ""The Ministry of Road Transport and Highways has decided to declare all lanes in all toll fee plazas on national highways across the country as dedicated 'FASTag lanes' from 1st of December this year,"" the ministry said.According to the National Highways Fee (Determination of Rates and Collection) Rules, 2008, a FASTag lane in a toll plaza is reserved exclusively for the movement of FASTag users. In a letter to the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) on Friday, the ministry asked the authority to ensure strict implementation of the new fee rules at every toll plaza on the national highways. The decision has been taken in order to promote the faster payment of fees through the digital model so that vehicles can move through seamlessly, and traffic jams at the toll plazas can be prevented.The radio-frequency identification (RFID)-based FASTag is affixed on the windscreen of the vehicle. It allows for direct payment of fee from the prepaid or savings account linked to it and enables vehicles to drive through without stopping for transactions. However, it is found that currently, even non-FASTag users are passing through FASTag lanes and making cash payments. This is leading to crowding of the such lanes and overall traffic congestion at the plaza, defeating the purpose of the FASTags. As a result, electronic toll collection through FASTags has not grown as much as was desired.To ensure smooth implementation of this decision, the ministry has asked the NHAI to assess the overall requirement of FASTags across the country and make it available in requisite numbers. The required civil and electronic infrastructure at all toll plazas is also to be provided before the implementation date of December 1. The NHAI has also been asked to identify and resolve logistics and other problems that are likely to lead to any law and order problem in this venture.",https://www.timesnownews.com/india/article/all-toll-plaza-lanes-to-be-fastag-lanes-from-december/456532?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

245,Benjamin Netanyahu becomes longest-serving Israeli PM,"Benjamin Netanyahu has become Israel's longest-serving Prime Minister, surpassing the record set by the country's founding father and first leader David Ben-Gurion. As of Saturday, Netanyahu has spent 4,876 days – more than 13 years – in office. Netanyahu won his first election in 1996, becoming Israel's youngest-ever Prime Minister at the age of 46.",The Guardian,"Benjamin Netanyahu has become Israel‘s longest-serving prime minister, snatching the title from the country’s founding father and first leader, David Ben-Gurion.As of Saturday, the man referred to as King Bibi by both those who adore and detest him, has spent 4,867 days – more than 13 years – in office.During the past two decades, the now-69-year-old former commando has repeatedly won elections on promises of making Israel secure and prosperous, while sidelining the Palestinians.“He has convinced many voters that he is irreplaceable,” said Gideon Rahat, a political science professor at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem and senior fellow at the Israel Democracy Institute.Despite passing the historic milestone, Netanyahu still needs to win a September election and survive three impending corruption cases to continue his long tenure.His supporters claim Israel has never been richer, safer or more globally accepted, including by leaders of Arab states. Critics argue he has opened fissures in Israeli society, stigmatised minorities to win elections, crushed progressive and human rights activism and encouraged the rise of far-right politics into government.In the latest election in April, he was accused of appealing to racist voters when he stated Israel was “not a state of all its citizens”, referring to the country’s minority population of Palestinian citizens. Netanyahu later made an election pact with a group of far-right extremists called Jewish Power.In his party, the rightwing Likud, Netanyahu has remained at the top, even when it appeared scandals and crises might take him down.“He is very talented at not letting any challenger grow within his party. Any person that looked even close to being popular was somehow kicked out or neutralised,” Rahat said. “Nobody was seen as a replacement for him.”In 1996, Netanyahu became Israel’s youngest prime minister, running on a platform against flailing peace attempts, especially the Oslo accords that gave some limited autonomy to the Palestinians.Under his leadership, control over Palestinian life has become entrenched. The military occupation of the West Bank is tightly managed, while Jewish settlement construction has spread, giving Netanyahu support from hawkish and pro-settler sections of society.Orit Galili-Zucker, a political communications adviser who has worked with Netanyahu, said the prime minister had since made “no courageous decision on the Israeli-Arab conflict. Israel remained stuck and he personally profited from his zero progress.”Netanyahu had also managed to stay in power for so long, she said, by not embarking on grand military campaigns that resulted in large numbers of Israeli casualties, such as the 2006 Lebanon war headed by his predecessor, Ehud Olmert.And as a man who made his break in politics as an affable English-speaking Israeli diplomat, he had excelled, she said, in campaigning and using TV and social media to rally support.Yet Netanyahu could see his extraordinary run in power cut short before the end of the year.One month after appearing to win the election, he failed to form a coalition government. Rather than risk losing the premiership to another contender, he chose to push parliament to disband and force another national vote. Fresh polls are set for 17 September, the first time the country has held two elections in one year.Famed for 11th-hour brinkmanship and daring political gambits, many expect Netanyahu to win. But even then, he faces possibly the biggest challenge of his political career to date: the prospect of three corruption indictments.Just weeks after the election, he will be called to a pre-trial hearing. Israel’s attorney general has already recommended he be indicted.One case involves allegations of receiving gifts, including cigars and champagne from international billionaires, allegedly in exchange for favours. In another, Netanyahu was accused of colluding with the country’s top-selling newspaper to hurt its competition in exchange for favourable coverage.A third case involves allegations that Netanyahu offered incentives to the Israeli telecoms provider Bezeq in exchange for positive stories on a news website it owns.Netanyahu has denied all accusations, dismissing them as a witch-hunt orchestrated by the media. He is not legally required to step down unless he is convicted and all his appeals are rejected.… we have a small favour to ask.

Pelli, who grew up in Argentina and studied architecture at the University of Tucumán in the country’s far northwest, established himself as a visionary and educator, making a name for himself in the United States where his main studio was based. Argentina’s Telam state news agency reported his passing on Friday, as did the governor of Tucuman province, where Pelli grew up and spent his formative years. “With much regret we receive the sad news of the death of the great Architect César Pelli,” the region’s governor, Juan Manzur, said in a post on Twitter. “I want to convey my condolences to his whole family, his friends and his team.” “He was without doubt a creator and his legacy will endure forever in each of his works.” In 1977, Pelli became dean of Yale University’s School of Architecture and founded Cesar Pelli & Associates, according to a biography on the website of the New Haven, Connecticut-based studio, since renamed Pelli Clarke Pelli, which lists offices in New York, Abu Dhabi, San Francisco, Tokyo and Shanghai. Along with the Petronas Towers, at the time the tallest buildings in the world, Pelli’s famous works include the World Financial Center in New York, Canary Wharf Tower in London and renovation work on New York’s Museum of Modern Art. Reuters could not immediately reach his firm for comment.

249,Will work to free rapper A$AP Rocky from detention in Sweden: Trump,"US President Donald Trump has said he'll be working to free rapper A$AP Rocky, who's in police custody in Sweden. ""I'll be calling the very talented Prime Minister of Sweden to see what we can do about helping Rocky,"" Trump tweeted. The rapper, whose real name is Rakim Mayers, was arrested over his alleged involvement in a fight in Stockholm.",The Guardian,"Donald Trump has said he is working to free the American rapper A$AP Rocky, who has been held in police custody in Sweden for weeks.“I will be calling the very talented Prime Minister of Sweden to see what we can do about helping A$AP Rocky,” Trump tweeted from aboard Air Force One on Friday, and said he had just spoken with Kanye West about Rocky’s situation.“So many people would like to see this quickly resolved!” Trump said.Rocky, a platinum-selling, Grammy-nominated artist whose real name is Rakim Mayers, has been in police custody since early July as Swedish police investigate his alleged involvement in a fight in Stockholm that occurred before his appearance at a music festival. Videos published on social media appear to show a person being violently thrown onto the ground by Rocky. A defense lawyer has said he acted in self-defense.Congressman Adriano Espaillat, of New York, has been pushing for the rapper’s release and has been in contact with the state department and the US embassy in Sweden. Rocky is originally from the neighborhood of Harlem in New York City.The case has earned the attention of a slew of celebrities, including Sean “Diddy” Combs, Justin Bieber, Jada Pinkett Smith, Nicki Minaj and Post Malone.Kim Kardashian West encouraged Trump to take action to free Rocky. Kardashian West has previously worked with the Trump administration on criminal justice reform issues.One senior administration official, speaking to the Associated Press on condition of anonymity to outline private conversations, said Kardashian West had reached out to Trump’s son-in-law and senior adviser, Jared Kushner, whom she has worked with closely, to tell him about the situation on behalf of her husband, a supporter of the president.Kushner then briefed Trump, according to the official, who said Trump felt the case was worth looking into and directed his secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, to see what could be done.The state department said Friday that it was following the case but declined to provide details, citing privacy considerations. Providing assistance to US citizens detained abroad is one of the department’s most important functions, it said.Kardashian West thanked Trump, Pompeo and Kushner via Twitter, along with “everyone involved with the efforts to Free ASAP Rocky & his two friends”.“Your commitment to justice reform is so appreciated,” she wrote on Thursday.Rocky’s lawyer, Slobodan Jovicic, told the Associated Press that his client was aware of the president’s comments and “is very thankful for everyone who has reached out to show their support”.“It means a lot to him, but we are focused on the case that we have in front of us,” he added.Trump did not mention Kardashian West or Kushner to reporters in the Oval Office on Friday and said it was his wife, Melania Trump, who had originally brought the case to his attention.“She was telling me about, ‘Can you help A$AP Rocky?’” said Trump, who said he had also heard from others.“Many, many members of the African American community have called me, friends of mine, and said, ‘Could you help?’ So I personally don’t know A$AP Rocky, but I can tell you that he has tremendous support from the African American community in this country,” he said.“We’ll be talking to them,” Trump said, referring to Swedish officials. “We’ve already started.”“We’re working with the state department, and we hope to get him home soon,” added the first lady.The Ohio pastor Darrell Scott, a longtime Trump supporter who is African American and has worked with the administration on urban justice issues, said he was among those who raised the issue with Trump last Friday night after Rocky’s management reached out for assistance.“We know that this is a high priority for the president and the state department, at the instruction of the president,” said Kareem Lanier, the co-chair of the Urban Revitalization Coalition who credited the White House with ensuring Rocky was moved to better holding conditions.Both Lanier and Scott rejected the idea that Trump was calling attention to the issue to distract from criticism of his attacks against four Democratic congresswomen of color, noting the administration had been working on the issue before the latest brouhaha.They applauded Trump for shining attention on the issue.“Any time President Trump gets involved in anything, it brings a level of attention” to an issue that cannot be matched by those who “don’t have that cache or reach”, Lanier said.Stockholm’s district court decided on Friday that Rocky would remain in custody another week to allow police to complete their investigation. They have until 25 July.Jovicic, Rocky’s attorney, said he felt the decision was “unjust”, but remained confident in his case.The Associated Press contributed reporting… we have a small favour to ask.

250,Chrome update to stop sites from checking for Incognito Mode,"Technology giant Google has said that at the end of July, its internet browser Chrome will ""remedy"" a loophole that has allowed sites to detect people who are browsing in Incognito Mode. It added it will also change any other methods of detecting Incognito over time. The release of Chrome 76 is scheduled for July 30, Google revealed.",Engadget,"Chrome's Incognito Mode hasn't been working as well as promised lately -- some sites now check for private browsing and insist that you sign in before you can read an article.  Google sees that as a flaw, though, and intends to set things right.  The company will use the July 30th release of Chrome 76 to close a ""loophole"" where sites could check for Chrome's FileSystem framework (disabled in Incognito Mode) and use its absence to detect a private session.  Google will also change any other methods of detecting Incognito going forward.The internet giant says it's a matter of respecting the very purpose of Incognito mode: maintaining privacy.  While people do use private browsing to dodge site paywalls, people may have far more serious reasons for staying anonymous.  They may be trying to avoid an abusive partner or political oppression, for instance.  Google suggested that publishers avoid knee-jerk reactions to the Chrome change and instead consider either more ""generous"" free view allowances or requiring a free registration for all content, not just under certain articles or conditions.This move could please people concerned that private browsing modes are losing some of their value.  It's likely to rub some publishers the wrong way, though.  Outlets like the New York Times (which we've asked for comment) have been detecting Incognito Mode in a bid to track readership, goad people into subscribing, or both.  They're unlikely to accept Google's changes without a fight, even if the damage might be limited.",https://www.engadget.com/2019/07/18/chrome-76-to-stop-private-browsing-checks/?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

""What needs to be stressed upon is that whoever is out of power among the two, sheds crocodile tears whenever there are (such) cases,"" she said. As many as 10 tribals were killed in the incident.",The Financial Express,"BSP chief Mayawati on Friday hit out at both the national parties — BJP and Congress — for Sonbhadra incident in which 10 tribals including three women lost their lives. The BSP president said that both the parties are equally responsible for atrocities committed on the people belonging to the tribal community. She also said that the Congress during its rule ousted tribals from forest and some of them later became Naxals.“The Congress and BJP governments at the Centre are equally responsible for the atrocities committed on tribals in the country. The tribals were ousted from the forest during Congress rule and some of them even became Naxals,” she said. The BSP chief said that now the members of the Kol/adivasi samaj were removed from Sonbhadra and killed during BJP rule. “But what needs to be stressed is that whoever is out of power among these two parties, sheds crocodile tears whenever there are cases of atrocities,” she added.Mayawati’s statement comes on a day when Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi was detained on her way to Sonbhadra where 10 people were allegedly gunned down by a village head and his henchmen. The Congress leader was scheduled to meet the family of the victims but was stopped in Mirzapur, UP. In an apparent reference to today’s development, Mayawati said that the Congress was doing all this days after the incident but the BSP started pressurising the administration to do justice ever since the incident happened.Former Congress President Rahul Gandhi today called the detention of Priyanka Gandhi as ‘illegal’ and ‘disturbing’. Priyanka Gandhi’s husband Robert Vadra in a social media post termed the detention as ‘completely unconstitutional’. “No documents were produced for the arrest…This is a complete abuse of law in every respect,” he said. He further said that the state government should immediately release her and let democracy be a democracy and not a dictatorship.Get live Stock Prices from BSE and NSE and latest NAV, portfolio of Mutual Funds, calculate your tax by Income Tax Calculator, know market’s Top Gainers, Top Losers & Best Equity Funds.

257,Rajiv’s error will be repeated if triple talaq not criminalised: Arif,Ex-Union Minister Arif Mohammad Khan on Friday said the Prime Minister Modi-led government will repeat the mistake committed by the Rajiv Gandhi-led government in the Shah Bano case if triple talaq is not criminalised. The Rajiv Gandhi government introduced a bill in 1986 reversing Supreme Court’s order saying triple talaq victim has the right to demand maintenance from her ex-husband.,The Financial Express,"Batting for criminalising the practice of triple talaq, former Union minister Arif Mohammad Khan on Friday said that if it is not done the Modi government will be committing the same mistake as Rajiv Gandhi did in the Shah Bano case. Without naming the Congress, Khan said the party that had won over 400 seats in 1984 was suffering from the “curse of the destitute”. “What was Shah Bano given? Rs 147 to keep her body and soul together. The curse of destitute is haunting” them, he said. Khan said he wrote a six-page letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi in October last year, requesting him to criminalise the practice of triple talaq.“In the letter, I explained to him how in 1986 by enacting a law we reversed the judgement of the Supreme Court and now if we do not enact a law to ensure that the judgement of the Supreme Court is followed in letter and spirit, if we fail to make a law to criminalise triple talaq then we would be making the same mistake that was committed in 1986,” he said.Also read: Congress ousted tribals from forest, now shedding crocodile tears: MayawatiDelivering a lecture here on ‘Why triple talaq should be made a punishable offence’, Khan said a lot of “churning is taking place in Rajya Sabha” over the passage of the Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Marriage) Bill 2019. “I am hopeful that this time the ordinance criminalising triple talaq would be passed by Rajya Sabha as there is a lot of churning taking place and people are talking about what happened in 1986 (Shah Bano case),” he said.Khan was a minister of state in the Rajiv Gandhi government in 1986 but he resigned over the government’s stand in the Shah Bano case. Shah Bano was a Muslim woman from Indore. Divorced by her husband in 1978, she filed a criminal suit in court and won the right to alimony from her husband. Her husband had challenged the lower court’s order in the Supreme Court which upheld the lower court’s order. However, the then Rajiv Gandhi government brought a bill – Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Divorce) Act, 1986 in Parliament to reverse the judgment.Khan had openly opposed the government’s decision to bring a bill in Parliament to reverse the Supreme Court’s order that the victim of the triple talaq has right to demand maintenance from her ex-husband under Section 125 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 which applies to all citizens regardless of caste or religion. Strongly supporting criminalisation of the practice of triple talaq, Khan said there is absolutely no doubt that if it becomes a proper law then it would help in upholding the dignity of women. He said the common argument given to oppose its criminalisation is that it is a matter of civil law not criminal.“What these eloquently speaking men do not understand is that divorce is a civil matter and no one, neither a Hindu nor a Muslim, would be jailed for divorcing his wife but the practice of Triple Talaq is criminal,” he said. The Supreme Court had in 2017 banned the practice of triple talaq. But since the practice was still prevalent, a bill was brought to make it a penal offence. With the dissolution of the 16th Lok Sabha last month, the bill had lapsed as it was pending in Rajya Sabha.The Bill, which proposes to make the practice of instant triple talaq (talaq-e-biddat) a penal offence, had faced objections from the opposition parties which claimed that jail term for a man for divorcing his wife was legally untenable. A fresh bill, Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Marriage) Bill, 2019, has now been introduced in Lok Sabha to replace an ordinance issued in February by the previous BJP-led NDA government.The new bill is a copy of the ordinance in force. The government had promulgated the ordinance on triple talaq twice — in September 2018 and in February 2019 — as the contentious bill remained pending in Rajya Sabha Under the Bill, divorcing through instant triple talaq is illegal, void and will attract a jail term of three years for the husband.Get live Stock Prices from BSE and NSE and latest NAV, portfolio of Mutual Funds, calculate your tax by Income Tax Calculator, know market’s Top Gainers, Top Losers & Best Equity Funds.

262,Iran seizes British-flagged oil tanker 2 weeks after its ship seized,"Iran on Friday seized British-flagged oil tanker Stena Impero while it was sailing in the Strait of Hormuz. The move comes two weeks after the British Royal Marines seized an Iranian ship in Gibraltar. Britain had claimed Iran seized two oil tankers, however, Iran said the second tanker had been allowed to continue its course after being given a warning.",Reuters,"LONDON/DUBAI (Reuters) - Britain said Iran seized two oil tankers in the Gulf on Friday and told Tehran to return the vessels or face consequences in the latest confrontation to ratchet up tension along a vital international oil shipping route. Iran’s Revolutionary Guards said they had captured the British-flagged Stena Impero, announcing the move two weeks after the British navy seized an Iranian tanker in Gibraltar. Iran’s semi-official Tasnim news agency said the second vessel, the British-operated Mesdar, had not been seized. It said the ship had been allowed to continue its course after being given a warning over safety and environmental issues. The Stena Impero and Mesdar changed direction sharply within 40 minutes of each other shortly after entering the Gulf through the Strait of Hormuz, taking up a course toward Iran, Refinitiv tracking data showed. GRAPHIC: Map of tanker's route - tmsnrt.rs/2O646ZX  The data later showed Mesdar changing direction again, heading westward back into the Gulf. “These seizures are unacceptable. It is essential that freedom of navigation is maintained and that all ships can move safely and freely in the region,” British foreign minister Jeremy Hunt said. Hunt later said, in comments reported by Sky News, that there would be consequences if Iran did not return control of the ships but said Britain was not considering military options. U.S. President Donald Trump said he would talk to Britain about the issue, speaking after a war of words earlier on Friday about whether the United States had shot down an Iranian drone in the Strait of Hormuz. Already strained relations between Iran and the West have become increasingly fraught since the British navy seized Iran’s Grace 1 tanker in Gibraltar on July 4 on suspicion of smuggling oil to Syria in breach of European Union sanctions. Oil prices LCOc1 gained on Friday after the latest spike in tensions along the Strait of Hormuz, through which a fifth of the world’s oil supplies pass. Iran’s Guards, an elite force under the command of Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, said they seized the Stena Impero at the request of Iranian authorities for “not following international maritime regulations,” state television reported. Northern Marine Management, which is owned by Stena AB, confirmed the Stena Impero was heading toward Iran. Norbulk, the manager of the tanker Mesdar, said the vessel had been boarded by armed personnel but was later allowed to continue its voyage. It said the crew were safe and well. Iran had said it would retaliate against the seizure in Gibraltar. Just days later, three Iranian vessels tried to block a British-owned tanker passing through the Strait of Hormuz but they backed off when confronted by a British navy ship. Refinitiv data showed the Stena Impero vessel is owned by Stena Bulk and indicated its destination had been the Saudi port of Jubail on the Gulf. The tracking map showed it veering off course about 1517 GMT and heading toward Iran. The Mesdar made its shift toward Iran at about 1600 GMT. “We received reports that the British Stena Impero oil tanker was causing incidents and, therefore, we asked the military to direct it to Bandar Abbas port for the necessary probes,” Allahmorad Afifipour, head of Hormozgan’s maritime authority, told Tasnim news agency. Tasnim, which cited military sources as saying the Mesdar had not been seized, said the Stena Impero had been causing pollution by dumping oil residue. An Iranian military source said the Stena Impero “had turned off its tracker and ignored several warnings by the Guards before being captured,” the official IRNA news agency reported. State television said the Stena Impero was taken to a coastal area and turned over to the authorities to take the necessary legal steps, the television added. Supreme Leader Khamenei said on Tuesday Iran would respond to Britain’s “piracy” over the seizure of the Iran’s Grace 1 tanker in Gibraltar. Tehran has repeatedly called for the ship’s release, denies the allegation that the tanker was taking oil to Syria in violation of sanctions and says Gibraltar and Britain seized the vessel on the orders of Washington. Tensions between the United States and Iran have been steadily rising since Washington withdrew last year from a global pact aimed at reining in Tehran’s nuclear program and imposed sanctions that seek to shutdown Iranian oil exports. Iran has said it would not halt its oil exports, the government’s main source of revenue. Behnam Ben Taleblu, an analyst at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, said Tehran’s action suggested U.S. sanctions   “are working and that negotiations with America or world powers will need to happen”. Guy Platten, secretary general of the International Chamber of Shipping, called on all those involved in Friday’s shipping incident to seek a swift resolution to the incident that threatened the safety of seafarers. “Freedom of navigation is vital for global trade and we encourage all nations to uphold this fundamental principle of maritime law,” he said.

Ashwin was reacting to Zimbabwe all-rounder Sikandar Raza who had tweeted, ""How one decision has made so many people unemployed.""",CricTracker,"They had once made a sensational debut in the Cricket World Cup in 1983 by beating Australia by 13 runs. In fact, Zimbabwe had also beaten the same team in their first-ever match in the T20 World Cup in South Africa in 2007. But all the glittering history has now come to face shame as the International Cricket Council (ICC) has suspended the African nation because of political interference, freezing funding to Zimbabwe Cricket (ZC) and barring any team from the country to participate in any ICC event.This extreme step by the international body has made Zimbabwe’s participation in the upcoming qualifiers for both the women’s and men’s T20 World Cups highly unlikely. The ICC Board met over Zimbabwe for several rounds of talks in London this week and decided unanimously that ZC has breached Article 2.4 (c) and (d) of the world body’s constitution.AdvertisementIt was also held that the Sports and Recreation Commission’s (SRC) act of suspending the cricket board in June constituted interference by the government into the country’s cricketing affairs. SRC is a government body which suspended ZC last month as well as its acting managing director Givermore Makoni. ICC Chairman Shashank Manohar said they did not want to take the decision of suspending a member lightly but also at the same time, wanted to keep the sport away from political touches.Ace India spinner Ravichandran Ashwin took to Twitter to express his disappointment over the treatment that was meted out to Zimbabwe, a promising cricketing nation that was badly hit by non-cricketing reasons. The country has seen a serious talent drain over the years because of political instability and especially the policies of the former Robert Mugabe administration had impacted its cricket as well.During the 2003 World Cup, former cricketers from Zimbabwe Andy Flower and Henry Olonga had exhibited before the world a black arm-band protest against the state of political affairs in their country. Even England had boycotted them in that tournament.Ashwin, who is in great touch in County cricket in England at the moment, tweeted in response to a heart-breaking tweet from Zimbabwe cricketer Sikandar Raza who had said that the decision to suspend Zimbabwe left so many people and careers in hopelessness and so many families in a disarray.The Indian off-spinner sympathised with Raza’s tweet saying it “shows the agony of cricketers and how their life’s have been taken away from them.” He hoped that Zimbabwe will soon be back to their days of glory.",https://www.crictracker.com/sikandar-razas-tweet-on-zimbabwe-suspension-touches-ravi-ashwin-he-hopes-african-nation-returns-to-glory-soon/?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

Jet's lenders had also approved the eligibility criteria for potential buyers.,Reuters,"MUMBAI (Reuters) - Lenders to Jet Airways agreed on Friday to provide some interim financing to the bankrupt airline to help it cover legal and other costs, as resolution experts look to find a potential buyer. In a regulatory filing, bankruptcy resolution firm Grant Thornton said Jet’s lenders had also approved the eligibility criteria for potential buyers. The filing did not say how much interim funding had been approved, but a source familiar with the matter told Reuters the lenders had agreed to provide $10 million.   The committee of creditors (CoC), via an electronic voting process, also agreed to appoint SBI Caps to help with the whole resolution process.  SBI Caps, the investment banking arm of State Bank of India (SBI), previously led an unsuccessful sale process for the airline before it was dragged to bankruptcy court.  The source said Grant Thornton planned to open bidding for the airline on Saturday. The only criterion for bidders will be  having a net worth of 10 billion Indian rupees ($145 million), added the source.  This is similar to the parameter used when lenders initially tried to sell the airline. Bidding is likely to be open for 15 days and may be extended if there are no suitors, said the source. Last month, Jet’s creditors, led by SBI, took the airline to bankruptcy court after failing to agree on a revival plan.      Financial creditors, who have the first right to proceeds recovered from a bankruptcy resolution, have submitted claims worth 102 billion rupees out of which 85 billion have been admitted.

283,Virgin Orbit to launch small satellites for UK military,"Virgin Orbit, the small satellite launching arm of billionaire Richard Branson's spaceflight firm Virgin Galactic, has signed an initial agreement to develop small satellite launch capabilities for the UK's Royal Air Force (RAF). Virgin Orbit aims to launch hardware provided by UK-based Surrey Satellites in a demo mission. The deal is part of RAF's Artemis mission.",Engadget,"Virgin Orbit, the small satellite launch arm of Virgin Galactic, will provide launch capabilities for the UK's Royal Air Force (RAF). Virgin has been angling for government contracts recently and has managed to land a project called Artemis ""to demonstrate the utility of small satellites and responsive launch to provide information to the RAF.""The unique feature of the Virgin Orbit program is how quickly a launch can be arranged. Typically, a launch takes years of planning and can only take place from certain sites which access particular orbits. This means that access to a given orbit can never be guaranteed on short notice. However, Virgin believes it can offer launches with as little as a week's notice by making use of its customized 747-400 aircraft which acts as a ""flying launch pad.""This speed of deployment is a particular selling point for the military. ""We've built a launch system to address commercial needs, but we've found it has enormous advantages for government customers,"" said Dan Hart, President and CEO of Virgin Orbit.The RAF's Artemis project is not to be confused with NASA's Artemis project. NASA's Artemis is a commercial partnership for moon landings, and the RAF's Artemis is a commercial partnership for launching satellites. Despite the similar names and fields, they are totally different projects.Hart also expressed optimism that the project could support peaceful international relations in space: ""Ultimately, we are hopeful that by demonstrating the capability to quickly and easily deploy and replace satellites in Low Earth Orbit we will be helping to remove the incentive for any nation to invest the money in harming another nation's satellite.""Virgin Orbit performed a successful drop test of its LauncherOne vehicle a few weeks ago. Now it will finalize assembly and testing of its orbital rocket before the first launch into space, scheduled for later this year.",https://www.engadget.com/2019/07/19/virgin-orbit-raf-contract/?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

287,People didn't take me seriously after father's death: T-Series MD,"Music label and film production company T-Series' MD Bhushan Kumar said people didn't take him seriously when he took over the company in 1997 after his father Gulshan Kumar was murdered. ""They would say 'Your father was a genius in marketing, what can you do?' I had to convince them, literally with folded hands, to trust me,"" the 41-year-old added.",Livemint,"Bhushan Kumar, chairman and managing director of the music record label T-Series, is almost dismissive of the new record his company has created—that of becoming the most-subscribed YouTube channel in the world. He says he didn’t even realize they were on to something until it was brought to his notice.Yet, as the 41-year-old talks about T-Series becoming the first YouTube channel to breach the 100 million subscribers mark (at the time of writing, T-Series had exactly 105,246,690 subscribers), he accepts that it is a big deal for an Indian company to get to this figure. The feat has got them a place in the Guinness World Records.In the run-up to becoming the most-subscribed channel, the intense head-on contest between T-Series and its fans and Swedish video-blogger PewDiePie and his followers has become the stuff of internet legend. The competition between them turned so acrimonious at one point that T-Series went to court against two diss-tracks by PewDiePie that made fun of the company. Then, in March, Kumar appealed to his subscribers’ patriotism with a #BharatWinsYouTube campaign. Backed by popular contemporary singers and a country that loves its Bollywood music, it did the trick.When we meet at his top-floor penthouse home in Mumbai’s Andheri on a Saturday, Kumar, dressed in a fatigue-style shirt, blue suede slacks and Asics sneakers, walks in humming a song. He can’t remember later which song it was, but it was probably an unreleased number that was playing in his head. The music baron is particular about the music his company produces—he approves most of the songs personally. He often pauses to check his phone during this conversation, because, as he explains, a lot of his work happens over WhatsApp and all the songs he listens to are on his phone.T-Series, founded in 1983 with 750 employees in Delhi and Mumbai, has 29 channels on YouTube hosting music videos and film trailers, transitioning successfully from the cassette-tape era to the digital era. The digital revenue share of the overall business is 50-60%, according to the company. Though he may not be recognized on trips to Spain and France, says Kumar, his record label is now a familiar name.Kumar, who studied commerce, took over the company when he was still in his teens, after his father Gulshan Kumar, the founder of Super Cassettes Industries Pvt. Ltd (the parent company of T-Series) and a pioneering force in the Indian music industry, was shot down by gangsters in 1997. Those were difficult days for Bhushan—apart from the trauma of losing a parent under tragic circumstances, he was new to the business, there were labour issues at factories, and judicial challenges.“People would not take me seriously,"" he remembers. “They would say: Your father was a genius in marketing, what can you do? I had to convince them, literally with folded hands, to trust me.""He had steady support from family—his mother, sisters Tulsi and Khushali (both singers), and uncle Kishan, as well as his father’s friend Ved Chanana. The industry rallied around, he says, as he went about consolidating his business.“In the initial days, I used to get so paranoid: What if some song does not do well? There were so many what-ifs… till I made my first album, Deewana (1999), which was a success and gave me a lot of confidence that whatever I make based on my taste could work.""Though the bulk of their music is for films, the company offers a bouquet of non-film music albums, dance numbers and remixes. He says remixes and recreations work because listeners want new-sounding songs sung by the current generation of hit singers. “If I just remix and release, no one will listen,"" he says. “I am adapting, changing the song and merging a new song into an old one.""He offers the example of last year’s hit song Dilbar, sung by Neha Kakkar, which is a recreation of an older version. “It starts with a new tune and then lands into Dilbar, Dilbar, Dilbar…,"" he says, singing it softly. “Recreation is not remix, it’s the demand of the season. Not all recreations work, but 95% of what we have made has worked. It is not easy to recreate a song.""In music, T-Series works in every regional language—be it Tamil, Telugu, Malayalam, Kannada, Bhojpuri, Kashmiri, Haryanvi, Punjabi, Gujarati, Marathi, or any other. In movies, it works in Hindi, Punjabi, Marathi, Tamil and Telugu.T-Series has moved aggressively into non-film music as well, says Kumar, and is revamping its devotional offerings by improving the sound and making today’s singers sing on a different note. Punjabi pop, of course, has always had a big market.Kumar explains his process of song selection through one scenario. When a film-maker or director gives them the song situation, they get the tune and the lyrics in place. When a song comes for his approval, he may suggest changes in, say, the melody. With Dilbar, for instance, Kumar initially didn’t like the way it started.Then they get the sound producers on board, work on the baseline, the groove, and decide on the singer. The company has around 20 singers, like Neha Kakkar, Armaan Malik and Jubin Nautiyal, working with them, though they work with other singers as well.“Music is just ear sense, which I inherently got from my father. The ability to judge a song came from him as well. I am not trained in music…,"" he says.“I don’t listen to any music except the ones which are not released, which we are making. I get it almost immediately—whether the song would work or not—and then it is improvisation. Then I listen to it a few times to get it right. In some songs, there is space to put a bridge—a different tune that connects the start to the end. I keep humming songs that we have made and are popular because they are fresh in the mind,"" he says.“Our responsibility is not just to make films for music but to make music for films,"" he explains. There was a time when T-Series had a reputation for making movies only to promote its music but it has ventured aggressively into movie production of late—they have about 17 releases this year, with some of the recent ones being the Salman Khan-starrer Bharat and the much discussed Kabir Singh. He is excited about the Ajay Devgn film Taanaji: The Unsung Warrior, set to release early next year.The move into movies was strategic, he explains—his father too had been keen on it. Films that are produced or co-produced by T-Series begin with a “Gulshan Kumar presents"" logo because from the day Bhushan Kumar took charge, he felt his father continued to be with him.Kumar’s instinct with films, he confesses, is not as refined as his musical sense. “You give me a song now, I will give my judgement, and 90% of the time I will be right. It is simple for me but is otherwise tough to do. But there are times—because I am not God—10% of the times, when a song has worked though I said it would not.""He insists that beyond passion and creativity, movies are a business. “You have to work towards the cost. I have never worked so passionately on a film that I have forgotten the cost. I am a strict businessman. If I am spending  ₹20, I need at least 20% back on it."" Some time back, the company had announced a film, Mogul, which was to be based on the life of Gulshan Kumar. It got postponed, but he says work on it will start next year, though he is not ready to disclose the director and actor heading the project. “We want to tell his (Gulshan Kumar’s) inspirational story in a commercial way because everything we have is due to him. He is the guiding force, because it would have been (otherwise) practically impossible for a 19-year-old to handle such a big empire.""The next move for their production company is to get into web series and movies for digital streaming platforms.As the interview winds down, Kumar gets restless, checking his phone more frequently. I ask about his passion for supercars—there was a time when Kumar used to have an enviable collection of high-end cars. He says he didn’t have the time to drive them and felt it was a waste to have them standing in his garage.He remains enthusiastic, however, about his new Rolls-Royce Cullinan SUV. He can sit in the back seat in comfort, switch on some music on his phone and maybe sing along.***Favourite old-time singer/composerKishore Kumar/R.D.

The actor, who has been in Big Apple for over nine months now, said that there was one treatment “still left to be done” and that he will not be back home in Mumbai before the end of August.Opening up about his ill-health in a recent chat with a tabloid, Rishi said, “The cancer is in remission, but I am still under treatment.” The actor informed that there was a six-week gap between one treatment and the next, when one could live a normal life, something which he wanted to do in Mumbai rather than in New York.Speaking of the support he received from his loved ones during the challenging phase, he said, “It has been a difficult time, very taxing, but Neetu (wife), and my children (Ranbir and Riddhima) have been very supportive. I am waiting to come back and raring to get going.”“My son [Ranbir] literally forced me into the aircraft and flew here [to New York] with me. The acceptance comes gradually,” he said in an interview with Bombay Times.“I will plan my return five-six weeks after my last treatment. It is called consolidation or pushback, whereby I will have to undergo chemotherapy to ensure that the ailment does not return. This is the second time I am going through the treatment. I am hoping that I can plan an end-August return but all this talk that I will be back in early September for my birthday, is again nothing but speculation,” he said talking about his plan to return to India.Rishi, 66, revealed that he was diagnosed with cancer when he was shooting in Delhi and had dyed his hair white for the role. Then, the rumour had spread that he was so unwell that his hair had turned white overnight. To counter this, he said, whenever his friends came to see him, they posted pictures so people could see what he really looked like.He revealed that during the course of treatment, he had lost 26 kg and had no appetite for the first four months. But his health has improved now and he has regained seven-eight kg.  Rishi revealed that some work on his latest release Jhootha Kahin Ka was pending and that he dubbed for the film while being in New York. He said, “I am guilty of the fact that I had to leave in such a situation. I cannot thank them [the makers] enough for not complaining one bit about anything. When I started recovering a few months back and feeling better, I told them that I cannot come back to India, but they could come here and finish the dubbing or whatever is left. So, that is what they did.

292,"Microsoft posts record Q4 results, shares hit all-time high","Microsoft posted its Q4 FY19 earnings report revealing it made $33.7 billion in the quarter, 12% higher than the same quarter last year. The technology giant delivered a ""record fiscal year"" with a revenue of $125.8 billion, representing a 14% increase from the year before. Microsoft shares rose over 2.6% to record-high of above $140 in after-hours trading on Thursday.",Reuters,"(Reuters) - Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) on Thursday beat analysts’ estimates for fourth-quarter revenue and profit, driven by continued sales increases from its cloud business and sending its shares to all-time highs.  Since Chief Executive Satya Nadella took over in 2014, Microsoft has been shifting away from its Windows operating system software and toward cloud services, in which customers move their computing work to data centers managed by Microsoft.  Revenue growth in Azure was 64% in the fiscal fourth quarter ended June 30, compared with 89% a year earlier and 73% in the prior quarter. Microsoft does not provide an absolute revenue figure for Azure, blending it into its “intelligent cloud unit,” which had revenue of $11.4 billion compared with analyst expectations of $11.0 billion, according to Refinitiv data. (For an interactive graphic, click here tmsnrt.rs/2JIzvfe) Microsoft also forecasted between $10.3 billion and $10.5 billion in intelligent cloud sales for the fiscal first quarter, with a midpoint above analyst estimates of $10.13 billion. The forecast helped send shares of Microsoft up more than 2.6% to record highs above $140 in after-hours trading. Cloud growth powered Microsoft’s market value past $1 trillion for the first time in April. On Thursday, Microsoft’s Azure-based business segment for the first time ever reported slightly more quarterly revenue than its Windows-based segment. “The pressure was obviously on but they executed,” said Hal Eddins, chief economist for Microsoft shareholder Capital Investment Counsel. “The cloud is such a key driver of growth for them and they seem to have painted a big bullseye on the back of AWS.” In the cloud computing business, Azure’s chief rival is Amazon Web Services, which dominates the industry with a 32.8% market share, according to research firm Canalys. Microsoft has a share of 14.6%, while Google has 9.9%.  Microsoft has also gained ground in the past year by bundling its Azure computing service for developers along with Office and other software products for end users, such as in the more than $2 billion cloud deal it signed with AT&T Inc (T.N) earlier this week. Microsoft has tried to set itself apart from AWS by combining its traditional software that runs in a customer’s own data center with its Azure products, a strategy that Chris Voce, analyst at Forrester, said helped power the company’s results. “Its hybrid cloud strategy has resonated with enterprises where this is a more realistic and flexible approach,” Voce said. Revenue in Microsoft’s productivity software unit jumped 14.3% to $11.05 billion, driven by double-digit revenue growth for LinkedIn and Office 365. Analysts on average had expected revenue of $10.71 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. Meanwhile, its personal computing division, home to Windows software, rose to $11.3 billion, compared with analyst estimates of $10.98 billion. The unit also includes Xbox gaming consoles, the Bing online search service and Surface laptops. Mike Spencer, head of investor relations at Microsoft, said Windows results were fueled by customers upgrading from Windows 7, which will be retired next year, and the result of some PC customers stockpiling inventory in anticipation of possible tariffs. “What we’ve seen is there was even maybe more pent-up demand than we anticipated,” Spencer said. He said the company did not feel any impact from sales restrictions placed on Huawei Technologies Co Ltd by the U.S. government. Microsoft's net income rose to $13.19 billion or $1.71 per share in the fourth quarter, from $8.87 billion or $1.14 per share a year earlier. (bit.ly/2JDI8Jq) Excluding items, the company earned $1.37 per share, topping estimates of $1.21 per share.  Total revenue rose 12% to $33.72 billion, above average analysts’ estimates of $32.77 billion.

This would get homeless people into shelters and houses, West Palm Beach Mayor, Keith James, said.",RT,"The highly annoying viral songs (‘Raining Tacos’ is also on the playlist) are played on a loop at the Waterfront Lake Pavilion, a venue often used to host private events like weddings and bar mitzvahs, according to the Palm Beach Post.The city officials’ chosen method to deter the homeless has been “effective” and is a “temporary measure,” West Palm Beach Parks and Recreation Director Leah Rockwell told the newspaper.“We are not forcing individuals to stay on the patio of the pavilion to listen to the music. The music is heard only if you are on the patio, a very small area relative to the rest of the waterfront,” Rockwell said.But the idea has not found many fans online, with social media users reacting in disgust to the “abusive” behavior.“That’s disgusting. Try helping the less fortunate instead of abandoning them in the ‘home of the free,’” one unamused tweeter wrote. Another person suggested that the city should “fire anyone who took part in this and use their salaries to build affordable housing or a shelter.”Using annoying or repetitive music as a means of forcing a certain behavior is nothing new — in fact, it has been common practice for the CIA to use music as torture.In 2003, Sgt. Mark Hadsell told Newsweek that pop music and heavy metal was being used by US PsyOps teams in Iraq. “If you play it for 24 hours,” Hadsell said, “your brain and body functions start to slide, your train of thought slows down and your will is broken. That’s when we come in and talk to them.”The infamous ‘I Love You’ theme song from the ‘Barney & Friends’ kids show in the US is reportedly one of the CIA’s favorite torture music choices. Queen's ‘We Are The Champions’ and David Gray's ‘Babylon’ have also reportedly been used regularly.It’s also not the first time Florida officials have used music to drive homeless people from certain areas. A few years ago, the city had tried playing soft classical music throughout the day to keep drug dealers away from public spaces. That didn’t work, however, the Post said, because “people liked it.”Like this story?

The BSE benchmark cracked 879 points in two days of market fall. The Sensex had slumped 318 points Thursday. Here are five reasons why the markets left the investors high and dry.No respite for FPIs: Heavy selloff was witnessed as Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman dismissed the argument that the proposed hike in tax on the super-rich would spook foreign portfolio investors. She was replying to a debate on the Finance Bill in Parliament after market hours on Thursday.""Markets plunged sharply lower and lost over a%, in extension to Thursday's fall.

301,Budweiser owner sells Australia unit for $11 bn to cut $106 bn debt,"Budweiser maker AB InBev, the world's largest brewer, is selling its Australian subsidiary Carlton & United Breweries to Japan's Asahi at an enterprise value of $11.3 billion. Most of the proceeds from the deal will be used to reduce its $106 billion debt. The transaction comes only a week after AB InBev shelved the IPO of its Asia-Pacific operations.",Reuters,"BRUSSELS/LONDON (Reuters) - Anheuser-Busch InBev (ABI.BR), the world’s largest brewer, is selling its Australian operations to Japan’s Asahi (2502.T) for $11 billion and could revive the stalled flotation of its Asian business as it looks to cut debt. The Belgium-based brewer, weighed down with debt after its 2016 acquisition of rival SABMiller, said on Friday it had agreed to sell Australian subsidiary Carlton & United Breweries (CUB) at an enterprise value of A$16 billion (£9.01 billion). For Asahi, the deal is its biggest ever and, according to a source close to the negotiations, will turn the Japanese firm into the world’s third biggest brewer after AB InBev and Heineken (HEIN.AS).  The transaction comes only a week after AB InBev shelved an initial public offering (IPO) to sell a 15% stake in its Asian operations, including Australia, citing factors including unfavourable market conditions. The source said Asahi had expressed interest in buying the Australian unit earlier this year but discussions only took off after the IPO plan collapsed. “AB InBev was quick in re-engaging with Asahi as they could raise pretty much the same amount of cash they were aiming for with the IPO,” the source said, adding talks took place in Hong Kong and London. What would have been the world’s largest flotation this year, raising up to $9.8 billion for AB InBev, ended up being the third-largest ever to be withdrawn. Sources close to the matter said investors had baulked at the price. AB InBev said on Friday it still believed in the rationale of offering a minority stake of Asian business Budweiser APAC, now excluding Australia, provided it could be completed at “the right valuation”. The brewer, which had billed the IPO as a means to drive regional consolidation, said the Australia sale would help it to accelerate expansion into other fast-growing markets in the region and globally. Without Australia, a large but mature market, AB InBev’s Asia-Pacific operations would be more skewed towards faster-growth markets such as China, where AB InBev sells more Budweiser than in the United States. With the inclusion of Vietnam and India, too, the IPO could prove more attractive than before. Bernstein Securities analyst Trevor Stirling said the Australia business was a profitable cash cow, but an IPO without it could yield a higher valuation. However, a question mark would remain over AB InBev’s more mature South Korean business, given that it had bought it back from private equity group KKR in 2014. The bulk of the proceeds from the Australia deal will be used to reduce debt, AB InBev said, with the deal expected to close in the first quarter of 2020. AB InBev shares were up 4.6% at 1140 GMT, among the strongest performers on the FTSEurofirst 300 index .FTEU3 as the stock more than recovered ground lost last week.  The brewer’s net debt totalled $102.5 billion at the end of 2018 and its net debt to core profit (EBITDA) ratio was at 4.6 times. It has pledged to reduce that to less than four times EBITDA by the end of 2020 and has a long-term target of two times EBITDA. Asahi, which previously paid 9.85 billion euros to buy AB InBev’s eastern Europe business as well as the Grolsch and Peroni brands, already sells its Asahi Super Dry lager in Australia along with Schweppes. It will also gain leading Australian beer Victoria Bitter (VB), placing Asahi in more direct competition there with Japanese rival Kirin s (2503.T), which produces the XXXX Gold brand through its Lion subsidiary. Asahi said the deal would be debt-free and it would issue up to 200 billion yen ($1.9 billion) of shares to fund it. Rothschild and Nomura advised Asahi along with law firm Allen & Overy. Lazard and Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer worked with AB InBev. The Japanese brewer, which has been seeking overseas deals to compensate for slow growth, said net debt would temporarily exceed four times EBITDA, with its debt to equity and capitalisation ratios also expected to worsen. AB InBev said the enterprise value of the deal represented a multiple of 14.9 times EBITDA. The pricing of its shelved IPO had applied a multiple of 16-18 times for the Asian business. Jefferies analysts said the Australia multiple was attractive for AB InBev and would cut its net debt this year to $87 billion with a net debt to EBITDA ratio of 3.9, achieving its target a year early.

302,US city renames 'manholes' in a bid to remove gendered language,"The American city of Berkeley has renamed 'manholes' as 'maintenance holes' under the plan to remove all gendered language from its municipal code. The terms 'men and women' have been replaced by 'people', while the terms 'brother' and 'sister' will be referred to as 'sibling'. ""A male-centric municipal code doesn't reflect [Berkeley's] reality"", City Council member Rigel Robinson said.",The Guardian,"“Mankind”, “manmade”, “he” as a generic pronoun: English words may not be designated masculine or feminine, but the language still bears the mark of patriarchy. With a bit of care, however, it’s easy to even the playing field – how about “humanity”, “synthetic”, and “they”?It’s simple enough for writers and editors to swap around these words. It’s more remarkable when an entire city government commits to them. That’s what’s happening in Berkeley, California, where this week the city council committed to gender-neutral language in its municipal code.That means there are no more manholes in Berkeley – instead, there are maintenance holes. Brothers and sisters are siblings. People who like to kill things are hunters, not sportsmen; names before marriage are family names, not maiden names; and big tasks require human effort, not manpower. There are no more repairmen or fraternities; they’re repairers and collegiate Greek system residences. (Here’s a list of the terms.)Reaction from users of the local news site Berkeleyside was mixed, with some suggesting the city council had its priorities wrong. “I still can’t see the maintenance holes because the street is falling in and has not been replaced in 30 years,” wrote one commenter. “Now that the maintenance holes have been located, could we turn our attention to maintaining the neglect holes (formerly potholes) in the streets around them?” asked another.Others, however, were supportive of the move, which estimates say will cost only $600. And while the objections were amusing, the fact is that gendered language can take a serious toll. “Language is one of the most powerful means through which sexism and gender discrimination are perpetrated and reproduced,” write Michela Menegatti and Monica Rubini in the Oxford Research Encyclopedia of Communication. In a review of studies on the subject, they note that gender equality is higher in countries whose languages are less gendered.One key problem, Menegatti and Rubini note, is the use of masculine forms as generic: “There is implicit agreement that the prototypical human being is male.” We have historically added feminine suffixes like “ess” to job titles to denote that a person is female, as in “actress” or the archaic “poetess”. But if we’re talking about the profession as a whole, its performers are actors and poets, because being a guy is just, like, standard.The Guardian addresses this problem by using a single term for everyone. As the style guide entry for “actor” notes: “The Guardian’s view is that actress comes into the same category as authoress, comedienne, manageress, ‘lady doctor’, ‘male nurse’ and similar obsolete terms that date from a time when professions were largely the preserve of one sex (usually men).” But this has prompted some consternation, as some in the acting business prefer the term actress.Berkeley takes a different approach, avoiding such loaded terms entirely. Instead of heirs and heiresses, everyone is just called a “beneficiary”; instead of masters and mistresses, we have captains and skippers. For terms that end in “man”, the city takes a variety of approaches, some quite elegant: chairmen simply become chairs, craftsmen become artisans, bondsmen become bondspeople. (A pedant might argue that “man” comes from the Old English, which could be gender-neutral. But the thing about that is: who cares?)So if you’re in Berkeley and your sister gets stuck en route to the sewers when fleeing her burning sorority, be prepared to say: “My sibling fell in a maintenance hole, but she was saved by firefighters. Now repairers are restoring her collegiate Greek system residence using a great deal of human effort.” It may be a little clunky, but it’s better for humanity – not just mankind.… we have a small favour to ask. More people are reading and supporting The Guardian’s independent, investigative journalism than ever before. And unlike many news organisations, we have chosen an approach that allows us to keep our journalism accessible to all, regardless of where they live or what they can afford.

We are still in shock, to be honest, seeing how our international career can come to an end like that. Not just for one player, but for the whole country. I am not coming to terms with it so easily, and I am sure my team-mates feel the same way. Where do we go from here? Is there a way out,"" ESPN Cricinfo quoted Raza as saying on Friday.""I don't know what is the way out. We have been told that we have been suspended but not told for how long. A two-year suspension could basically bring an end to a lot of careers. I don't know the conditions but to totally suspend us from playing cricket, while you allow whoever is responsible to get our house in order, you basically stop cricket in Zimbabwe. I don't know how one can do that but it has happened to us now,"" he added.The ICC on Thursday suspended Zimbabwe Cricket with immediate effect for failing to fulfill their obligation of ensuring that there is no government interference in its administration.ICC's chairman Shashank Manohar had said that what happened in Zimbabwe is a 'serious breach' of the ICC Constitution.""We do not take the decision to suspend a member lightly, but we must keep our sport free from political interference. What has happened in Zimbabwe is a serious breach of the ICC Constitution and we cannot allow it to continue unchecked. The ICC wants cricket to continue in Zimbabwe in accordance with the ICC Constitution,"" Manohar had said.Zimbabwe Cricket now needs to get their administration in order by the next ICC meeting slated to be held in October this year. Raza said that it may be time for Zimbabwe's players to think about alternative careers.""If we miss the World T20 qualifiers, we will miss the T20 tri-series in Bangladesh [in September]. What if the house [ZC] is not in order? Is the ICC going to recognise the interim committee or the old committee? What is happening,"" Raza said.""I don't know where we go as international cricketers. Is it club cricket or no cricket for us? Do we just burn our kits and apply for jobs? I don't know what we have to do right now,"" he added.The 33-year-old Raza added that if the ICC had overseen the Zimbabwe Cricket elections earlier this year, then the apex cricketing body might have quickly recognised why the government's Sports and Recreation Commission (SRC) dismissed the board in the first place.""I genuinely thought that it would have been ideal if one member of the ICC had come and overseen the election process, for the reasons SRC dismissed the board, while we continued to play cricket. I thought that would have been a very good quick fix,"" Raza said.During the ICC Annual Conference, the cricketing body announced that concussion replacements will be introduced following successful trials in domestic cricket. The rule will be included in ICC playing conditions from August 1 this year.Moreover, the punishment for slow over-rate has been changed. According to the new decision, not only the captain but the players will also be held equally responsible and be fined at the same level as the captain.

Neumann still remains the single largest shareholder in the company, the report claimed.",TechCrunch,"Adam Neumann,  the co-founder and chief executive of the international real estate co-working startup WeWork has reportedly cashed out of more than $700 million from his company ahead of its initial public offering.The size and timing of the payouts, made through a mix of stock sales and loans secured by his equity in the company, is unusual, considering that founders typically wait until after a company holds its public offering to liquidate their holdings.Despite the loans and sales of stock, first reported by The Wall Street Journal, Neumann remains the single largest shareholder in the company.According to the Journal’s reporting, Neumann has already set up a family office to invest the proceeds and begun to hire financial professionals to run it.He’s also made significant investments in real estate in New York and San Francisco, including four homes in the greater New York metropolitan area, and a $21 million, 13,000-square-foot house in the Bay Area, complete with a guitar-shaped room (I guess a fiddle would be too on the nose). In all, Neumann reportedly spent $80 million on real estate.Neumann has also invested in commercial real estate (the kind that WeWork leases to provide work space with more flexible leases for companies and entrepreneurs), including properties in San Jose, Calif. and New York. Indeed, four of Neumann’s properties are leased to WeWork — to the tune of several million dollars in rent. According to the Journal, Neumann will transfer those property holdings to a WeWork-controlled fund.The WeWork chief executive has also invested in startups in recent years.

320,Man who set fire to Japan studio said firm stole his ideas: Reports,"The man suspected of setting fire to a Japanese animation studio was heard complaining that the studio had stolen his ideas, according to witnesses. The suspect, identified as Shinji Aoba, used large amounts of what appeared to be petrol, to set fire to the three-storey building. Thirty-three people were killed and over 30 others were injured in the arson attack.",The Guardian,"Investigators are searching for clues to the motive of an arsonist who killed at least 34 people in an attack on a popular Japanese anime studio that has plunged country into a state of shock.Thirty-six others were injured, some of them critically, in Thursday’s blaze at Kyoto Animation, which is Japan’s deadliest fire in nearly two decades.Everyone from Anime fans to prime minister Shinzo Abe expressed anger, prayed and mourned the Kyoto victims on social media and a crowdfunding appeal set up to support the company and victims – who remain unidentified – has also gathered more than $1m in pledges.The suspect, named by police as Shinji Aoba, did not work for the studio but shouted that he had been plagiarised and appeared to have planned the attack, Japanese media reports said on Friday.A woman who saw the suspect being detained told reporters he “seemed to be discontented, he seemed to get angry, shouting something about how he had been plagiarised”.Survivors said he was screaming “you die!” as he sprayed what emergency services officials called an unidentified liquid accelerant. They said some of the survivors were splashed with the liquid. The suspect was injured in the attack and is being treated in hospital.NHK footage also showed sharp knives police had collected from the scene, though it was not clear if they belonged to the attacker.Earlier, Hideaki Hatta, the chief executive of Kyoto Animation, said the company had recently received emails containing death threats, though it was unclear whether they related to Thursday’s attack. “They were addressed to our office and sales department and told us to die,” he said. “I am heartbroken. It is unbearable that the people who helped carry Japan’s animation industry were hurt and lost their lives in this way.”The fire appeared to have been set near the front door with some kind of flammable liquid, police said, forcing people to scramble up the stairs to the roof. Of the 34 bodies found by firefighters, 20 were on the third floor and some on the stairs to the roof, where they had apparently collapsed, Kyoto fire official Kazuhiro Hayashi said. Two were found dead on the first floor, 11 others on the second floor, he said.The building has a spiral staircase that might have allowed flames and smoke to rise quickly to the top floor, broadcaster NHK noted. Yuji Hasemi, a fire expert at Waseda University, told NHK that paper drawings and other documents in the studio also might have contributed to the fire’s rapid spread.The suspected arsonist started the fire in Japan’s ancient capital on Thursday morning when about 70 people had gathered for their day’s work at the three-storey building.“There was an explosion, then I heard people shouting, some asking for help,” a witness told TBS TV. “Black smoke was rising from windows on upper floors. Then there was a man struggling to crawl out of the window.”Most of the victims were employees of Kyoto Animation, which does work on movies and TV productions but is best known for its mega-hit stories featuring high school girls. The tales are so popular that fans make pilgrimages to some of the places depicted.Kyoto Animation, better known as KyoAni, was founded in 1981 as an animation and comic book production studio, and its hits include Lucky Star in 2008, K-On! in 2011 and Haruhi Suzumiya in 2009.The company does not have a major presence outside Japan, though it was hired to do secondary animation work on a 1998 Pokemon feature that appeared in US cinemas and a Winnie the Pooh video.Violent crime is rare in Japan, though it is not unknown. In July 2016, a mass stabbing at a care home by a former employee killed 16 and injured more. In September 2001, a fire at a building in the Kabukicho entertainment district of central Tokyo killed 44. Arson was suspected, but nobody was ever charged, meaning the Kyoto Animation attack is the worst confirmed mass murder in Japan’s post-war history.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jul/19/kyoto-animation-fire-police-search-for-clues-as-donations-pass-1m-mark?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts
321,Netherlands 10% liable for Srebrenica massacre: Supreme Court,"The Netherlands' Supreme Court has ruled that the state is 10% liable for the deaths of 350 Bosnian Muslim men in the Srebrenica massacre in 1995. Dutch UN peacekeepers evacuated the men from their military base near Srebrenica despite knowing that they ""were in serious jeopardy"", the court said. Bosnian Serb forces killed 8,000 Muslim men in Srebrenica in 1995.",Reuters,"THE HAGUE (Reuters) - The Dutch government accepted on Friday that the state was partially liable for the deaths in 1995 of 350 Muslim males who were expelled from a U.N. base and killed by Bosnian Serb forces at Srebrenica. The Supreme Court of the Netherlands upheld a previous ruling against the Dutch state and set its liability at 10% of the overall loss suffered. “The government accepts the verdict of the Supreme Court,” the defense ministry said in a statement. “The state thereby accepts liability for the damages as determined by the Supreme Court.” The Dutch ruling paves the way for payments to the families of victims and survivors of the killings at Srebrenica, when around 8,000 Muslim men and boys in all were taken away and murdered in what was the worst mass slaughter on European soil since World War Two. It was recognized as a genocide by the International Court of Justice. The adjudication of 10% liability means claimants are only likely to receive around a few thousand euros in compensation. However, the case could still set an international legal precedent for states’ liability when they contribute troops to peacekeeping operations.  During the Bosnian conflict in 1995, several hundred outgunned Dutch peacekeeping troops had been assigned to protect a U.N.-designated “safe area” where thousands of Muslims had sought refuge from Bosnian Serb forces - among them 350 men who made it into the Dutch base. The Supreme Court found that the Dutch forces could have allowed those men to stay in the base and that, by handing them over, they had knowingly and unlawfully sent them to possible abuse or death at the hands of the Bosnian Serb troops. “They took away the men’s chance to stay out of the hands of the Bosnian Serbs,” it said. Kada Hotic, one of the Mothers of Srebrenica group of survivors present in court, told Reuters that the Dutch government was responsible for the start of the genocide in Srebrenica.  “No matter if it’s one percent, ten percent or 100 percent, they are responsible,” she said. A lawyer for the victims said he would study the verdict to see if there are possibilities to fight the case further at the European Court of Human Rights. While the supreme court upheld the partial liability of the state, it rejected a second charge - that the assistance given by Dutch forces in removing those gathered outside the base had been unlawful. “Their accountability can never be erased. We won’t leave it here, we will go to the European court to see if we have the right to justice as Muslims,” said Munira Subasic, another plaintiff in the case.   The amount of the damages was not specified by the Supreme Court on Friday, but in an earlier case the Dutch state paid tens of thousands of euros to several survivors.  Hotic said the amount of compensation was not the priority for the Mothers of Srebrenica. “We want justice.” Additional reporting by Bart Meijer; Writing by Anthony Deutsch; Editing by Toby Chopra",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-netherlands-bosnia-srebrenica/dutch-state-partly-liable-for-srebrenica-deaths-supreme-court-idUSKCN1UE0TV?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts
322,"IndiGo posts highest ever profit of ₹1,200 crore as Jet collapses","India's largest airline IndiGo posted its highest-ever quarterly profit of ₹1,203 crore for the April-June period from ₹27 crore a year ago, benefiting from the collapse of Jet Airways. The company's revenue rose 45% to ₹9,420 crore. IndiGo expects available seat kilometres (ASK), a measure of its passenger carrying capacity, to grow 30% in the current financial year.",Reuters,"BENGALURU (Reuters) - Interglobe Aviation Ltd, the operator of India’s top  airline IndiGo, said on Friday it expected passenger capacity to grow by nearly a third this fiscal year, as the company posted a record quarterly profit, gaining from the collapse of Jet Airways. Interglobe and its peer SpiceJet Ltd have both seen a surge in passenger growth, after Jet Airways, once the country’s biggest private carrier, declared bankruptcy. IndiGo is now India’s largest airline by market capitalisation. However, the company does not expect gains from Jet’s shut down to last in the longer term.  “We do not expect any meaningful impact of Jet Airways to continue as all airlines have now replaced the capacity vacated by Jet,” Chief Executive Officer Ronojoy Dutta said in a conference call with analysts after results. In the near term, Interglobe expects available seat kilometres (ASK), a measure of its passenger carrying capacity, to grow 30% in the financial year ending March 2020 and sees a 28% jump in the current quarter. The company, in the middle of a spat between its co-founders, said it had submitted a report on a review by auditors Ernst & Young to the market regulator. “We don’t intend to make the report public at this time,” Dutta said, adding that the company’s board meeting will continue on Saturday.  IndiGo co-founder Rakesh Gangwal had earlier alleged violations of corporate governance rules at the parent group and asked the country’s securities regulator to intervene. Dutta had then sought to allay concerns and asked employees to remain focused on running the airline. EY had conducted an independent review on the company after the allegations, but found no major lapses, according to media reports. Dutta did not elaborate further on the proceedings. The ongoing spat, however, did not hit IndiGo's quarterly performance. The New Delhi-based company's net profit here for the three months ended June 30 surged to over 12 billion rupees ($174.29 million) from 277.9 million rupees a year ago. Revenue rose 45% to 94.2 billion rupees. “Strong passenger revenues along with a sharp improvement in cargo performance were key drivers to this improved profitability,” Dutta said. IndiGo’s yield, a measure of the average passenger fare per kilometre, rose 12.8% during the quarter, reflecting the rising passenger preference for the airline, while its ASK rose 30.3% during the period. Interglobe shares closed 0.28% higher on Friday, amid a broader market that ended 1.53% down.

""It's fun. It's not fun while you're doing it, but it's fun when you're finished. It's hard work, actually,"" Englert said about his feat.",The Guardian,"Roy Englert, 96, added yet another world record to his collection at last week’s USATF Masters Outdoor Championships, running the 5000m in 42:30.23 to shatter the existing age-group mark by nearly eight minutes at the Cyclone Sports Complex in Ames, Iowa.The Virginia native, who already held the 95 to 99 age group records for the 800m and 1500m and is a member of the world record 4x100, 4x400 and 4x800 relay teams, broke Frank Levine’s decade-old record of 50:10.56.The new mark is still pending approval by USATF.According to a Run Washington profile, Englert lives at a Lake Ridge retirement community and does most of his running on a treadmill: two to three miles for three days a week, or upping the mileage if a competition is nearing.“It’s fun. It’s not fun while you’re doing it, but it’s fun when you’re finished,” he said. “It’s hard work, actually.”Englert, a retired attorney, credits his late-career success to not to any natural gift but dogged persistence.“I don’t consider myself that much of an inspiration.

330,Instagram to warn if account faces risk of being disabled,"Instagram will now warn users if their accounts face a risk of getting disabled over violation of rules, through a notification process. The process will also offer the opportunity to appeal content deleted in certain cases, Instagram said. It added it will start removing accounts with a certain number of violations within a set window of time.",TechCrunch,"Instagram  this morning announced several changes to its moderation policy, the most significant of which is that it will now warn users if their account could become disabled before that actually takes place. This change goes to address a longstanding issue where users would launch Instagram only to find that their account had been shut down without any warning.While it’s one thing for Instagram to disable accounts for violating its stated guidelines, the service’s automated systems haven’t always gotten things right. The company has come under fire before for banning innocuous photos, like those of mothers breastfeeding their children, for example, or art. (Or, you know, Madonna.)Now the company says it will introduce a new notification process that will warn users if their account is at risk of becoming disabled. The notification will also allow them to appeal the deleted content in some cases.For now, users will be able to appeal moderation decisions around Instagram’s nudity and pornography policies, as well as its bullying and harassment, hate speech, drug sales and counter-terrorism policies. Over time, Instagram will expand the appeal capabilities to more categories.The change means users won’t be caught off guard by Instagram’s enforcement actions. Plus, they’ll be given a chance to appeal a decision directly in the app, instead of only through the Help Center as before.In addition, Instagram says it will increase its enforcement of bad actors.Previously, it could remove accounts that had a certain percentage of content in violation of its policies. But now it also will be able to remove accounts that have a certain number of violations within a window of time.“Similarly to how policies are enforced on Facebook,  this change will allow us to enforce our policies more consistently and hold people accountable for what they post on Instagram,” the company says in its announcement.The changes follow a recent threat of a class-action lawsuit against the photo-sharing network led by the Adult Performers Actors Guild. The organization claimed Instagram was banning the adult performers’ accounts, even when there was no nudity being shown.“It appears that the accounts were terminated merely because of their status as an adult performer,” James Felton, the Adult Performers Actors Guild legal counsel, told The Guardian in June. “Efforts to learn the reasons behind the termination have been futile,” he said, adding that the Guild was considering legal action.The Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) also this year launched an anti-censorship campaign, TOSSed Out, which aimed to highlight how social media companies unevenly enforce their terms of service. As part of its efforts, the EFF examined the content moderation policies of 16 platforms and app stores, including Facebook, Twitter, the Apple App Store and Instagram.It found that only four companies — Facebook, Reddit, Apple and GitHub — had committed to actually informing users when their content was censored as to which community guideline violation or legal request had led to that action.“Providing an appeals process is great for users, but its utility is undermined by the fact that users can’t count on companies to tell them when or why their content is taken down,” said Gennie Gebhart, EFF associate director of research, at the time of the report. “Notifying people when their content has been removed or censored is a challenge when your users number in the millions or billions, but social media platforms should be making investments to provide meaningful notice.”Instagram’s policy change focused on cracking down on repeat offenders is rolling out now, while the ability to appeal decisions directly within the app will arrive in the coming months.",https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/18/instagram-will-now-warn-you-before-your-account-gets-deleted-offer-in-app-appeals/?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

The accommodation needs to be done without affecting the present ratio of the unreserved. If the government had told to decrease the number of unreserved then we would have happily done that.

In 2016, the then PM John Key had to delay a visit to India after his plane broke down on a refuelling stop in the north of Australia.",Reuters,"SYDNEY (Reuters) - New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern was forced to fly  home on a commercial flight on Friday after a technical snag hit her air force plane, following a two-day trip to Australia, where she spoke of the need to boost regional cooperation.     New Zealand media said Ardern was returning on a commercial flight, and the country’s defense force said her aircraft had suffered a failure of its air data computer during pre-flight checks, affecting the flight management system. “A replacement part is being flown to Australia and it is expected the repair will be made tomorrow,” the defense force  added in Friday’s statement to the Australian Associated Press.  New Zealand does not have a dedicated aircraft such as the U.S. presidential Air Force One for its leaders, and the experience was not the first for one of its prime ministers.  In 2016, Prime Minister John Key had to delay a visit to India after his plane broke down on a refueling stop in the north of Australia.  On her visit, Ardern raised the issue of Australia deporting criminals with a New Zealand background, particularly those brought up in Australia with no connection to New Zealand. “He knows that I consider it to be corrosive to the relationship,” she said, referring to Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison. “I just think we can’t take our friendship for granted,” she added. There were no plans to change the policy, an Australian government spokesman told the agency, although Morrison did not directly address the topic.

A cricketer becomes eligible for this award only after he completes five years of retirement. Dravid and Kumble had retired in 2012 and 2008 respectively, while Sachin had retired from international cricket in November 2013.",Hindustan Times,"Legendary India cricketer Sachin Tendulkar added a fresh feather into his already illustrious cap as he was finally inducted into the ICC Hall of Fame on Friday. The batting icon was inducted along side South African pace legend Allan Donald and two-time World Cup-winning Australian woman cricketer Cathryn Fitzpatrick.Tendulkar became the sixth Indian to achieve this feat after Bishan Singh Bedi (2009), Kapil Dev (2009), Sunil Gavaskar (2009), Anil Kumble (2015) and Rahul Dravid (2018). Also Read: Sachin Tendulkar, Allan Donald inducted in ICC Hall of FameIn total, 87 cricketers have been inducted into this exclusive club with 28 cricketers from  England, 26 from Australia and 18 from West Indies. Pakistan have five representations from their nation, New Zealand and South Africa three each and Sri Lanka have one player chosen for this club.Before Tendulkar, five Indians were inducted into his list and one would argue why Rahul Dravid was chosen before ‘Master Blaster’ considering he had a better overall record. Moreover, Tendulkar was part of the team that won the 2011 World Cup while Dravid failed to add this particular trophy into his bulging cabinet.The answer to this question lies within the strict rules set by the ICC with respect to the prestigious award.  For a batsman to qualify for this exclusive club, he must have scored at least 8,000 runs and 20 centuries in any of the two major formats (ODIs and Tests). As for a bowler, he should have scalped at least 200 wickets and his strike-rate must be 50 in Tests and 30 in ODIs.Also Read: Tendulkar names two standout performers from India in World Cup",https://www.hindustantimes.com/cricket/sachin-tendulkar-inducted-into-icc-hall-of-fame-after-rahul-dravid-and-anil-kumble-here-s-why/story-kdMimJTmGVZttulKrUGW2N.html?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

347,ShopClues fires about 50% workforce to cut costs: Reports,"E-commerce platform ShopClues has reportedly fired about 200 employees, reducing its workforce by nearly 50%. ""The company is left with almost no money and that is why it didn't even pay the two months standard payout to employees,"" a report cited its sources as saying. A recent report had earlier claimed ShopClues lost an acquisition deal offered by Snapdeal.",Entrackr,"The road towards fall for ShopClues seemed inevitable when Snapdeal lost acquisition interest in it. Since the elephant (Unicorn) was falling, it was expected to affect several hundreds involved in either causing the fall or preventing the fall – employees.Sensing the wind that is taking ShopClues in direction of ceasing operations, the company has fired over 200 employees across functions marketing, ops, tech, admin, and human resource. According to multiple sources including over a dozen employees, ShopClues has laid off about half of its workforce this week. “About 200 employees were asked to leave today by their respective team managers. The company is left with almost no money and that is why it didn’t even pay the two months standard payout to employees,” said sources.About half a dozen employees confirmed that they also got compensation of about one and a half months’ pay. “The message that was communicated to us mentioned that the company is laying us off because of low performance. However, everyone knows – that’s not the case,” they added.While many employees saw this coming and were exploring opportunities elsewhere for several months, some cry foul as they have not been given time to find the their next employers. Notably, several companies such as Cars24, UrbanLadder, Rubique, Treebo and Rivigo had collectively laid off over 1,000 employees over the past few months.“We knew this might happen but at least expected leadership team or co-founders to announce this. The company didn’t even bother to send an official email on the layoff,” said employees. Sources also emphasised that salary and compensation of the leadership team have been cut by 70%. It’s worth noting that ShopClues was engaged in conversation for acquisition by Snapdeal for several months. However, Snapdeal backed out because of the amount of money ShopClues owed to Google, Facebook,  and several third-party vendors including logistics partners.Entrackr had exclusively reported about ShopClues acquisition by Snapdeal and its fall through. In response to our detailed queries, ShopClues spokesperson said, “We have been steadily reducing our workforce mostly in operating functions as we leverage gains from our technology. Our customer NPS has been increasing steadily for the last 2 years while our workforce has dropped by 50% in this time period. We have always been an employee-first company and have ensured that impacted employees, if any, are outplaced proactively. We hold this to the core of our culture.”Some sources also revealed that ShopClues is in the conversation for a stressed deal with FutureBazaar and few others. “It’s very unlikely that ShopClues would find a buyer from here. If someone acquires it then the deal would be largely meant to save taxes,” they added.This is for the first time any Unicorn in India has been pushed into such a shamble state. Nevertheless, such a situation could be possible with the company of any size and scale if business fundamentals are ignored. While we aren’t sure about ShopClues’s fate, it’s likely a dead-end for the Unicorn that was once considered as disruptor in Indian e-commerce space.Hat tip",https://entrackr.com/2019/07/shopclues-lays-off-over-200-employees-may-go-off-soon/?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the blast.",Reuters,"KABUL (Reuters) - A powerful bomb blast outside the gates of Kabul University in the Afghan capital on Friday killed at least eight people and wounded 33, as students and lawyers waited to take an examination, officials said.  Taliban militants are carrying out almost daily attacks, despite reported progress in efforts by the United States to broker an end to Afghanistan’s nearly 18-year war. There was no immediate claim of responsibility for Friday’s blast. On Thursday Taliban insurgents set off two car bombs outside police headquarters in the southern city of Kandahar, killing at least 12 and wounding more than 80. Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid said he was not aware of any Taliban involvement in Friday’s attack.  Health ministry spokesman Wahidullah Mayar said there were students among the 33 injured taken to hospital after the blast, which a student at the university campus said occurred while some were waiting to take a law exam.

354,South Koreans boycott Japanese brands amid diplomatic tensions,"Over 200 South Korean supermarkets and grocery stores are boycotting Japanese products and services amid the diplomatic tensions between the two nations, a trade group said. The boycott impacted sales of several products and services, including beer and tourism. The tensions escalated after South Korea's top court ordered Japanese firms to compensate Koreans they used as forced labour in WWII.",Reuters,"SEOUL (Reuters) - As soon as supermarket manager Cho Min-hyuk got to work the day after Tokyo imposed curbs on exports to South Korea, he pulled all Japanese products off the shelves. It was Cho’s way of taking a stand against Japan in a quickly worsening political and economic dispute between the two east Asian neighbors.  Such anger has prompted a widespread boycott of Japanese products and services, from beer to clothes and travel, disrupting businesses in what was already the worst economic climate for South Korea in a decade. Cho, who manages a 1,500 square meter Purunemart supermarket in Seoul, is taking the hit voluntarily. Over 200 other supermarkets and grocery stores are doing the same, according to Korea Mart Association, a trade group representing them. “Japan putting pressure on South Korea through export curbs, showing no regret over its past wrongdoings, is completely unacceptable,” said Cho, adding the 10-15% drop in sales he is already facing won’t change his mind.  Diplomatic tensions intensified since a South Korean court last year ordered Japanese companies to compensate Koreans who were forced to work for Japanese occupiers during World War Two.  On July 4, in apparent retaliation, Japan restricted exports of high-tech materials to South Korea, but denied the move was related to the compensation issue. Tokyo cited “inadequate management” of sensitive exports, with Japanese media reporting some items ended up in North Korea. Seoul has refuted that. Seoul has resisted taking any countermeasures, saying it would raise the dispute with the World Trade Organization. But Koreans are taking matters into their own hands, with beer apparently an easy target. The country’s top two convenience stores CU and GS25, run by BGF Retail (282330.KS) and GS Retail (007070.KS), told Reuters sales of Japanese beer plunged 21.5% and 24.2%, respectively, in the first two weeks of July from the previous two-week period. E-Mart (139480.KS) reported a 24.6% fall. Hongcheon Culture Foundation, a beer festival organizer, told Reuters it canceled an order of 1.2 tonnes of Kirin beer even as at last year’s edition the Japanese brand accounted for a tenth of revenues. South Korea buys 61% of Japan’s beer exports, spending 7.9 billion yen ($73.13 million) in 2018. Asahi Super Dry is the most popular imported brand, with sales tripling in the past five years, according to Euromonitor. An Asahi spokesman said the company was monitoring developments but declined to comment on the impact. Screenshots of Japan trip cancellations are trending on social media. Hanatour (039130.KS) said it now receives 500 tour reservations for Japan a day, from an average 1,100. Very Good Tour (094850.KQ) said new bookings fell 10% while cancellations rose 10% week-on-week. “If someone did something wrong, they shouldn’t be proud of themselves,” said Lee Sang-won, a 29-year-old designer, who canceled his Japan trip for a 130,000 won ($110.15) fee. Lotte Home Shopping said it stopped airing TV ads for Japanese tour packages as they expect poor results.  JejuAir (089590.KS) and Korean Air (003490.KS) reported a “slight drop” in bookings for Japan, with the latter blaming the pulling of the TV ads. Japan’s Fast Retailing (9983.T) fashion brand Uniqlo, which sells clothes worth around 140 billion yen - 6.6% of its revenue - in 186 Korean stores, is also feeling the anger. “There is a certain impact on sales,” chief financial officer Takeshi Okazaki, told reporters last week, without elaborating. Economists say the tech export curbs could shave 0.4 percentage point off South Korea’s gross domestic product this year. The boycott - if it proves to be more than just a brief burst of nationalistic fervor - could marginally add to that, unless consumers spend on something else. “We are pleased to see this has turned consumers’ favor towards our pens,” said Park Seol, assistant manager at stationery maker Monami (005360.KS), whose online sales have risen five-fold since the curbs. Shinsung Tongsang (005390.KS) said its ‘national liberation day’ limited edition t-shirt by his TOPTEN10 fashion brand sold twice as fast as last year’s version. For now, emotions are running high. Marvel fan Jang Bum-jin, 34, said he threw away all his Japanese pens and is not going to watch the latest Spiderman movie, which is distributed by Sony Pictures - a U.S.-based company owned by Japan’s Sony Corp (6758.T). “I love Spiderman, but I am fighting my desire to watch it,” he said.

The government will now directly monitor the cases against him and take legal action, Singh added.",The New Indian Express,"LUCKNOW: Turning the heat on senior SP leader and Rampur MP Mohammad Azam Khan, who has been booked in a series of intimidation and land grabbing cases, the Rampur district administration declared him land mafia on Thursday. Khan is accused of grabbing huge expanses of farmers’ land forcibly through coercion while being a minister in Akhilesh cabinet for his prestigious Ali Jauhar University project in Rampur. Confirming the latest development, Additional District Magistrate, Sadar, Prem Prakash Tiwari said that Khan’s name is figured on the anti-land mafia portal of UP government.Rampur DM Anjaney Kumar said that as per the government order, those, who are habitual of indulging in land grabbing using muscle power, were declared land mafia. “Their name gets registered in UP Anti-Land Mafia Portal which is monitored by the government,” said the DM adding that the case of Azam Khan fell in the same category.In fact, during the last one week, Rampur police lodged a series of FIRs on the basis of complaints of over two dozen farmers accusing Azam Khan and Ale Hasan, the then CO city, of grabbing their land through intimidation for Ali Jauhar university.As per police sources, over two dozen (26) such complaints of land grabbing through coercion were received from as many farmers during the last one week. So far around 15 cases under Sections 342, 384, 447 and 506 of IPC have been lodged against the Rampur MP. The cases registered against him also include his unsavoury comments against women in the recent past.SSP Rampur, Dr Ajay Pal Sharma said that the cases lodged against Azam Khan would be analysed by a three-member Special Investigation Team (SIT) and a fair report would be submitted on the basis of which further action would be taken against Khan.Meanwhile, Azam Khan rejected all the accusations against him calling all the FIRs ‘false’. He condemned the police action against him as part of BJP’s politics of vendetta. Khan said he was being tormented unnecessarily by the ruling  party in the wake of upcoming by-polls. “We have won the Lok Sabha election. Now we will win Rampur bypoll as well,” claimed the SP leader. The party has also protested against the allegations and raised the issue in UP Legislative Council alleging that he is being framed in ""fake"" cases. Khan accused the ruling BJP of creating a wedge in the society just for the sake of a few bighas of land and resisiting his move to enlighten the society through education.The state BJP government dismissed the SP's allegations, asserting it is treating everyone the same and the action is not driven by any political vendetta. Leader of the House and Deputy Chief Minister Dinesh Sharma termed the SP's allegations as baseless. ""The government is treating everyone in the same manner, and it is not an act of vengeance. The government has made an online provision of registering a report, and action will be done only after examining all aspects. The allegations which are levelled against the government are totally baseless, and do not have any link with the policy and intention of the government,"" Sharma said referring to the cases against Khan.However, taking exception of the cases registered against Azam Khan, SP chief Akhilesh Yadav has already set up a 21-member committee, led by leader of opposition in the Legislative Council Ahmad Hasan, to probe the veracity of charges levelled against party MP from Rampur.(With inputs from PTI)",http://www.newindianexpress.com/nation/2019/jul/19/samajwadi-party-mp-azam-khan-declared-land-mafia-by-rampur-administration-2006005.html?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

He was cast in 'Namdev Bhau: In Search of Silence' as the director was convinced he had ""cinematic appeal"", revealed Momaya. ""It's like living a life I never...dreamt of,"" said Namdev.",Times Now,"It's the power and beauty of cinema that makes it appear from places one doesn't usually think of. Namdev Gaurav, a 65-year-old driver, perhaps realised this when the family he used to work for asked him to give acting a try in their film, Namdev Bhau: In Search of Silence. Little did anyone anticipate that the film would go on to be selected for the prestigious Indian Film Festival of Melbourne (IIFM) and would even earn him a nomination in the Best Actor category. Producer Dheer Momaya, who decided to cast his chauffeur as the lead in his film, opened up about his decision. Momaya shared that there was a sense of relaxed urgency about him. He shared that while he wasn't sure if he'd be able to hold the screen for about ninety minutes, it was after the first day of the rehearsal that the film's director, Dar Gai, was sure of his potential. “Namdev Bhau inherently has a sense of relaxed urgency about him. That coupled with boundary-less wit are great to recreate emotions naturally for the camera. Also, the deep characteristic of his face helps distinguish the subtlest of emotions that he feels. However, initially, I just wasn't sure whether he would be able to hold the screen for 90 minutes. Moreover, I just didn't think he was prepared enough as an actor to deliver performance on a tightly budgeted schedule. Dar was convinced from the first day of rehearsals though,” he said. The producer also revealed that Namdev Gaurav has received offers from leading production houses. An elated Namdev Gaurav, who has earned a nomination alongside the likes of Amitabh Bachchan, Ayushmann Khurrana and Manoj Bajpayee, shared that he still can't believe he's acted in a film. ""I am feeling very happy and excited about my nomination. My family is also very happy about it. I still can't believe I acted in a film. Before making the film I had never been outside Maharashtra and now I have travelled outside abroad as well.”“It is like living a life, I never even dreamt of. We would always talk about all of these actors. All of these people from a very young age have worked really hard to reach where they are today and getting a nomination alongside Amitabhji and Manojji feels unreal to me,” he said. Namdev Bhau revolves around the life of Namdev Gaurav, who is tired of the noisy life of Mumbai and leaves the town in search of a 'Silent Valley'. It's his journey that finds the basic premise of the film. This isn't the first film festival Namdev Bhau is travelling to. From Busan International Film Festival, Dharamshala International Film Festival to MAMI - Mumbai Film Festival and IFFI - Goa, the film has turned into a festival favourite and how. ",https://www.timesnownews.com/entertainment/news/bollywood-news/article/65-year-old-driver-namdev-gaurav-nominated-in-best-actor-category-alongside-big-b-manoj-bajpayee-at-iifm/455960?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

7232,"UrbanClap, RentoMojo may list services on govt e-marketplace","Home services startup UrbanClap and furniture and appliance rental startup RentoMojo held talks to potentially list goods and services on GeM, the government's e-marketplace. GeM facilitates online procurement of common use goods and services needed by various government departments, organisations or PSUs. Earlier in January, the government decided to let startups list goods and services on GeM.",Entrackr,"The government had issued a notification in December 2017 to build an online marketplace that would cater solely to government departments, organisations, institutions, and PSUs. This was named GeM and within five months it was up and running.36 states and union territories use the platforms to procure goods and services from this marketplace and 24 of these have made it their exclusive source of supplies after a formal authorisation and mandate by the Ministry of Finance.Today, the platform counts for 35,816 buyer organisations, 2.34 lakh sellers and service providers, almost a million products and 10,136 services. It has completed 1.82 million orders together worth 25,443 crore of which 43% accounts for MSE order value.In an unprecedented move during January this year, the Government e-Marketplace (GeM) decided to join hands with the private consumer internet startups in the country to mutually benefit from the opportunities they can offer each other.For GeM, allowing startups to become sellers on its platform meant that instead of buying the entire supplies or service providing mechanisms, they can source them from these startups. This means a significant cut in capital expenditure, increased efficiency and enhanced savings for the govt.Online air tickets, hotel bookings, furniture, appliances, repairs maintenance, inventories etc are few of the categories that are being deliberated upon for a start.Startups, at the same time, stand to make huge gains from this opportunity. They get to sell their products or services to these government organisations directly, leading to an increase not just in scope but also scale.These will not just be beneficial for the revenue aspects of the firm but also increase their market value and reputation as the regular customers will put more faith in these firms that have associations with the government, vis-a-vis their products and services usage.The first of the consumer internet startups to identify and bank on this opportunity have already paid frequent visits to GeM quarters.To start with the process of listing on the platform, home service marketplace UrbanClap and furniture and appliance leasing platform Rentomojo have initiated talks with GeM to figure out the appropriate way of enrolling their services on the platform, reports ET.UrbanClap can offer its repair maintenance, cleaning crew to these govt entities and Rentomojo can spread its mojo by renting out appliances like A/C, refrigerators and microwaves to these government offices. These are small examples of the scope for these startups.The talks taking place are around figuring out the exact kind of services and products that can be offered by these startups on the platform and what are the financial rules that require modification to enable smooth processing of this partnership.Many more consumer internet startups are looking at this opportunity and intend to follow Rentomojo and UrbanClap’s suit as this an opportunity only a few would want to miss out on. It would be interesting to see how these synergies go on to increase the potential of not just the startup industry, but the digital commerce space as a whole.",https://entrackr.com/2019/05/gem-startups-urbanclap-rentomojo/?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

The cause of the animal’s death was not immediately clear, but previous media reports suggested he was suffering from kidney and liver problems.Tam’s death puts pressure on the ongoing efforts of conservationists hoping to use in vitro fertilisation to create offspring from Iman and an Indonesian male. Tuuga said there were problems with Iman’s uterus and that she was incapable of becoming pregnant, but was still able to produce eggs. “We just have to look after the last remaining rhino.

7236,Alibaba plans to raise $20 bn through HK listing: Reports,"Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba is considering raising as much as $20 billion through a second listing in Hong Kong, following its 2014 record $25-billion float in New York. The company is working with financial advisers on the offering, reports said. It aims to file an application confidentially in Hong Kong as early as the second half of 2019, reports added.",Reuters,"HONG KONG (Reuters) - Alibaba is considering raising as much as $20 billion through a listing in Hong Kong, people familiar with the matter told Reuters, lining up a second blockbuster deal following its 2014 record $25 billion float in New York. The deal, the biggest follow-on share sale in seven years globally, would give Alibaba a war chest to keep investing in technology - a priority for China as growth flags and as the world’s second-largest economy is locked in a mounting trade spat with the United States. The e-commerce giant is working with financial advisers on the offering and is aiming to file an application confidentially in Hong Kong as early as the second half of 2019, three people said on condition of anonymity as the plans are not public yet. While advisers and others close to the deal downplayed any trade war reasoning for the move, analysts said the context and geography could not be ignored. “For Chinese companies listed in the United States, one has to prepare a contingency plan,” said Hao Hong, head of research at broker BOCOM International.  “Given most of the Alibaba investors are in Asia, it makes sense to come closer to your home base and give investors an option to trade in the same time zone.”  Last week, Chinese chipmaker SMIC said it was delisting its New York shares in favor of focusing on its Hong Kong listing.    Sources with knowledge of Alibaba’s plans cautioned that many details were not yet clear, including the final planned size. One person with direct knowledge said it was more likely to be between $10 billion and $15 billion.  At $20 billion, Alibaba’s deal would be the sixth-biggest follow-on share sale ever, Refinitiv data shows.  It would rank behind NTT’s 1987 $36.8 billion sale, crisis era offerings of $24.4 billion and $22.5 billion from the Royal Bank of Scotland and Lloyds Banking Group, and the $20.7 billion raised by U.S. insurer AIG in 2012. A spokesman for Alibaba declined to comment. SoftBank Group, Alibaba’s largest investor, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The Japanese tech investor has a 28.8% stake, worth $115.7 billion, in Alibaba after it sold a small part of its original holding via derivatives to fund its acquisition of chip designer ARM in a transaction that completes next month. SoftBank founder and CEO Masayoshi Son is a close friend of Alibaba founder Jack Ma. Bloomberg was the first to report the plan for a Hong Kong listing.  Since its U.S. listing, Alibaba has nearly doubled in size to become the largest-listed Chinese company with a market value of more than $400 billion.  A Hong Kong listing would give mainland investors their first direct access to one of China’s biggest success stories, via the stock connect trading link between Hong Kong, Shanghai and Shenzhen.  It would also give the company an extra pocket of liquidity and potentially a better valuation if the household name became a favorite among retail investors in Hong Kong.  A Hong Kong-based analyst said while Alibaba is not in need of cash, the listing could help it improve its access to loans from Asian banks. “It means closer access to Chinese investors, and maybe Chinese investors are more bullish than the global investors in Alibaba,” the analyst added.  Rival Tencent, which is listed in Hong Kong, is trading at 26 times its expected earnings compared with Alibaba’s 22 times in New York, according to Refinitiv data. A Hong Kong listing for Alibaba would come as its 54-year-old founder prepares to step down as chairman in September, handing over the mantle to CEO Daniel Zhang. The company is also expanding into new sectors including cloud computing division and Hema, its chain of brick-and-mortar supermarkets as growth in its core e-commerce business slows. The listing would provide Alibaba with additional capital to fund its new and expensive initiatives, said James Hull, founder of Hullx capital and co-host of the China Tech investor podcast. “Alibaba has strong and growing free cash flow, but they’re also pursuing cash-hungry new initiatives,” he added.  An Alibaba float would be seen in Hong Kong as a victory, after the city lost the tech giant’s initial public offering to New York because its then rules precluded it accepting Alibaba’s governance structure, where a self-selecting group of senior managers control the majority of board appointments. Any big listing would also be a bonus to the city’s traders.  “With such a big market cap, it will enhance the daily trading volume [and] attract more funds into the market - that’s exciting many investors,” said Steven Leung, a director at UOB Kay Hian in Hong Kong. Trading in Alibaba shares averaged $2.2 billion a day in the first quarter of this year, according to Refinitiv data, compared with the total average daily turnover on the Hong Kong exchange of $12.9 billion in the same period.  Hong Kong amended its rules last year to make it easier for “innovative companies” already listed in New York or London to sell shares in Hong Kong, as part of a broader shake up of the city’s listing regime. The new rules allow companies based in greater China to list in the city even if their current weighted voting rights structures contravene Hong Kong’s rules for primary listings.  Such companies can also apply confidentially for a listing, as Alibaba is expected to do.  A spokesman for HKEX declined to comment on news of Alibaba’s listing plans in Hong Kong.  Reporting by Kane Wu, Sumeet Chatterjee and Julie Zhu in Hong Kong, Josh Horwitz in Shanghai and Saumya Sibi Joseph and Aditi Sebastian in Bengaluru; Additional reporting by Alun John and Donny Kwok in Hong Kong, Sam Nussey in Tokyo and Gaurav Dogra; in Bengaluru; Writing by Jennifer Hughes; Editing by Himani Sarkar",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-alibaba-listing-hong-kong/alibaba-mulls-raising-20-billion-via-second-listing-bloomberg-idUSKCN1SX1OR?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts
7237,"PNB Q4 loss narrows to ₹4,750 crore on lower provisions","PNB on Tuesday reported a ₹4,750-crore loss for the March quarter, improving its performance from a year ago when it reported a ₹13,417-crore loss. The state-owned lender's provisions declined to ₹7,611 crore during the quarter, from ₹12,970 crore last year. The lender's net interest income grew 37.1% from a year ago to ₹4,200 crore in the March quarter.",Livemint,"MUMBAI: India’s second-largest public-sector lender Punjab National Bank (PNB) slipped into the red, incurring net losses of  ₹4,750 crore in the January-March quarter, after posting a net profit of  ₹247 crore in the preceding quarter.The bank posted losses of  ₹13,417 crore in the year-ago period.The lender could not garner profit in the quarter ended March as recovery from stressed assets of  ₹5,000-6,000 crore were stuck in insolvency courts, PNB managing director and chief executive officer (CEO) Sunil Mehta said on Tuesday.“A few things which we thought will happen during this quarter didn’t materialize. In two-three major accounts (Essar Steel and Bhushan Steel and Power), which have already been resolved by the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT), were on the table, but that money could not be unlocked. Against that, we had to make 100% provisioning because of the ageing,"" Mehta said. The bank expects a write-back of roughly  ₹4,000 crore, he added.“Because of some regulatory permission we could not get in time, our stake sale for PNB Housing Finance didn’t materialize. These were the expected inflows that would have given us a net profit (in January-March),"" he said. There has been a delay in the recovery of stressed assets because of litigations. A slowdown in the economy affects the prospect of investment proposals for stressed assets and, thus, slows down resolution. Bad loans also restrict the bank’s ability to finance more projects.PNB’s provisions declined 41.3% year-on-year to  ₹7,611 crore in January-March. Gross non-performing assets (NPAs) in the quarter fell to 15.5% from 18.38% year-on-year, while net NPAs declined to 6.56% from 11.24%.The lender also has an exposure of less than  ₹900 crore to Jet Airways, a senior PNB official said, on the condition of anonymity. The lender’s net interest income grew 37.1% from a year-ago to  ₹4,200 crore in the March quarter. Net interest margin, a key measure of profitability, rose from 1.90% in the March quarter of 2018 to 2.45%. Due to an improvement in the asset quality, led by lower provisioning, fewer NPAs and fresh slippages, PNB’s net loss narrowed to  ₹9,975 crore in 2018-19, from  ₹12,283 crore a year ago.Gross NPA fell to  ₹78,473 crore during 2018-19 from  ₹86,620 crore a year ago. Similarly, net NPAs fell by 38% year-on-year to  ₹30,038 crore in 2018-19.The bank had incurred net losses during the fiscal year 2017-18, after it discovered fraud of more than  ₹14,000 crore involving jewellers Nirav Modi and Mehul Choksi at its Brady Road branch in Mumbai in January 2018.Thereafter, PNB had posted losses for three consecutive quarters, beginning January-March 2017-18.“The bank has strong fundamentals. We suffered a setback last year of which 50% provisioning was made last year and 50% has been made this year. We have taken a conscious step to clean up the book and take provision coverage ratio to a reasonably high level, which gives a high degree of safety to our stakeholders,"" Mehta added. Mehta said he expects PNB to be back in black soon and hopes to garner  ₹1,000 crore from the sale of non-core assets during the current fiscal year. PNB will focus on the recovery of NPAs, conservation of capital, rationalization of operation, and sale of non-core assets, he said.Mehta also said that the bank has not received any proposal for taking control of two-three small state-owned banks and has not thought about it.Shares of PNB ended at  ₹86 on the NSE, down 3.1% from its previous close.",https://www.livemint.com/companies/company-results/pnb-q4-net-loss-narrows-to-rs-4-750-crore-on-lower-provisions-1559019193216.html?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

7241,"No time to lick wounds, Rahul best person to lead Congress: Tharoor","Congress leader Shashi Tharoor has said Rahul Gandhi ""undoubtedly"" remains the best person to help rally Congress party out of the predicament it finds itself in. Adding that Congress party members have no time to sit and lick their wounds and must instead pick up again immediately and effectively, Tharoor said, ""It's far too premature to write Congress' obituary.""",Hindustan Times,"Rahul Gandhi is the best person to pull the Congress out of its predicament following the setback in the Lok Sabha polls, says party leader Shashi Tharoor while declaring that his party is “alive and kicking” and it is too premature to write its obituary.   The Congress has no time to sit and lick its wounds as it must immediately pick itself up for the upcoming state elections, Tharoor told PTI.The party faces an existential crisis with the party president adamant on his decision to quit after the poll debacle -- winning just 52 Lok Sabha seats -- and its state governments facing an uncertain future.   Tharoor, who scored an electoral hat-trick by winning from the Thiruvanathapuram seat in the Lok Sabha polls, also said he is ready to take on the job of the Congress’ leader in the Lok Sabha if offered the post. The Congress still represents the only credible national alternative to the BJP and it will take its message to the country, hopefully under Gandhi’s leadership, he said.Also read| ‘Rahul’s decision to quit suicidal… walking into BJP trap’: Lalu Prasad In his view, the Gandhi-Nehru family will continue to command “great clout and respect” within the party, on the basis of the tremendous contributions it has made in shaping and guiding the party since Independence.

Asked about Gandhi’s offer to resign and if he was still Congress’ best bet in terms of leadership, Tharoor said attempts in the media to pin all the blame for the party’s  electoral setback on his shoulders are simplistic and unfair. “I think it does a disservice to the very complex challenges facing the Congress party to reduce it to a question of one person. “While Rahulji has bravely taken full responsibility for the defeat, we all are responsible for what went wrong and we all have a responsibility to ensure the party’s revival,” the 63-year-old leader said. Gandhi will easily beat any other interested candidate by a landslide if the party decides to hold a free and fair election tomorrow for the position of party president, he claimed.Also read| Priyanka meets Rahul Gandhi as he stays firm on quitting as Congress chief “That is the kind of place he has built in the hearts of the rank and file of the Congress party and therefore, to my mind, he still undoubtedly remains the best person to help rally the party out of the predicament it finds itself in and help us collectively move forward,” Tharoor said. Asked whether a non-Gandhi could lead the party, Tharoor said others can rise to prominent positions in the Congress and a case in point is that the last two Congress prime ministers were not Gandhis. “Still, I have no doubt the Gandhi-Nehru family will continue to command great clout and respect within the party, just on the basis of the tremendous contributions they have made in shaping and guiding the party since Independence,” the former diplomat said. Two former prime ministers from the Gandhi family -- Indira Gandhi and Rajiv Gandhi -- even sacrificed their lives for the nation and this is the proud legacy to which Rahul Gandhi is heir, he said. Asked if the Congress still remains a credible alternative to the BJP, he said, “It’s far too premature to write any obituary for the party – as Kerala and Punjab have shown, we are very much alive and kicking.”   Despite Congress’ poor showing across the country, the party performed well in Kerala and Punjab, winning 15 and eight seats respectively. “I strongly believe that we have no time to sit and lick our wounds and must instead pick up again immediately and effectively — not least because we have several state elections coming up, some of which are four or five months away,” he said. Elections are due in the states of Jharkhand, Haryana and Maharashtra later this year. Tharoor said he strongly disagreed with Swaraj India leader Yogendra Yadav’s recent “ill-considered” statement that the “Congress must die”. “I genuinely and passionately believe that what the Congress stands for and offers the nation is fundamentally indispensable to the future of the country,” he said. The Congress represents an alternate vision of the idea of India, an inclusive and pluralist vision, that reflects truly the heart and soul of the country, Tharoor said. Asked if he would take up the role of Congress leader in the Lok Sabha, he said, “If offered, certainly I would, but that is not for me to determine. It is clear, though, that since so many of our stalwarts have lost these elections, those of us who remain will have to pull our weight and take on extra responsibility. I am ready for that.”   Talking about polarisation playing a role in elections, Tharoor said certainly the party has to understand why voters chose not to vote in their economic self-interest. With unemployment at a 45-year high, farmers in such distress that record numbers are committing suicide, and small and micro enterprises are shutting down all over the country, one would think that economics would decide the election, he said. “...Why should a young man who voted for Mr Modi in 2014 in the hope of getting a job vote for him again in 2019 when he still doesn’t have a job? And yet he did,” Tharoor said.",https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-time-to-lick-wounds-rahul-gandhi-best-person-to-lead-congress-shashi-tharoor/story-zLA1agxDflYYWlMDm8cVbL.html?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

7256,Afghanistan is in the WC not just because of me: Rashid Khan,"On being asked whether he is the key player who helped Afghanistan qualify for the 2019 World Cup, spinner Rashid Khan said, ""No, not really. We have got a good team. We fought back really well in the qualifying round."" ""For us, every match is very important... The whole of Afghanistan will be praying for our success,"" Rashid added.",Times Now,"Afghanistan cricket team has developed tremendously over the past year or so and now find themselves in the ICC World Cup 2019, hoping to produce at least a few upsets and stun the cricketing world. While a number of players have developed over the years, a particular name that has performed on a consistent basis is that Rashid Khan's. The spinner has gradually developed himself into an all-rounder who is able to finish games for his team as a No. 6 or No. 7 batsman. But when asked whether it's him that the team's success mostly relies on, Rashid asserted that it's the team whose performance has made Afghanistan what it is today.In an interview with Times of India, Rashid revealed Afghanistan fought as a team in the qualifiers to book themselves a spot in the World Cup finals. With the tournament opener only a few days away, he can't wait to take on the big teams like India, Australia, England and the others.“No, not really,” Rashid said when asked whether he is the key to Afghanistan making the top-10 for the marquee event. “We have got a good team. We fought back really well in the qualifying round. That’s the reason we are in the main draw.” “We are glad that we have to play against mighty teams like India, Australia, England, New Zealand, South Africa and of course Pakistan. For us, every match is very important. We have to make a mark in all the matches. The whole of Afghanistan will be praying for our success. The countrymen are the strength of our team. We are all emotionally charged to do well in England and Wales,” he added.Rashid further admitted that the players in the national team have shown tremendous development over the past 14 - 15 months and they plan to continue working hard in order to become good cricketers.“I cannot deny this,” Rashid said when asked whether it's the recent 14-15 month period in which the team has shown rapid development. “According to the current situation, all the Afghanistan players have to do well in any game, anywhere in the world. I always tell myself, unless we work hard, we cannot become good cricketers.”Having already made his name as a spinner, Rashid has gradually started to show his abilities with the bat as well as those on the field. Still only 20 years old, the Afghan sensation said that he plans his practice session keeping in mind that he wants to be a top player in all the formats of the game – Test, ODI and T20Is – with franchise cricket across the globe being one of the reasons why he has had to develop the other aspects of his game – batting and fielding – as well.“Limited-overs cricket has become a part and parcel of every international cricketer’s life. There are very few cricketers who play only the Test matches. For me, I have to play in all versions of the game and if any cricketer wants to play and establish himself as a professional cricketer, he has to improve in all the departments. I plan my practice schedule accordingly. Other than bowling in the nets, I spend time with the bat as well. Since I have been playing lot of T20 cricket in Bangladesh, Australia and India, I had to develop my fielding. As I told you earlier, my aim is to improve as a cricketer every day. In order to achieve that, I am spending lot of time during the practice sessions,” revealed the talented cricketer.As for the World Cup hopes, Rashid said, “We will fight and we will try to do well as a team.”",https://www.timesnownews.com/sports/cricket/article/afghanistan-not-just-about-me-we-have-a-good-overall-team-rashid-khan-on-icc-world-cup/426527?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

7279,Schoolgirl killed as man stabs 18 people at Japan bus stop,A schoolgirl was killed and 17 others were injured in a stabbing carried out by a man in his 50s at a bus stop in Japan on Tuesday. The alleged attacker had stabbed himself in the neck and was later confirmed dead. Police officials said the attacker was seen holding knives in each hand during the attack.,Reuters,"TOKYO (Reuters) - A knife-wielding man slashed at a group of schoolgirls at a bus stop in Japan on Tuesday, killing one girl and an adult who may have been the father of one child, media reported. Sixteen other girls between the ages of 6 and 12 and a woman were wounded in the attack by a middle-aged man who died later of a self-inflicted wound, broadcaster NHK said, citing police. Police said an 11-year-old girl and a man, 39, were killed, but declined to give further details. The 39-year-old, a foreign ministry official, was believed to be the father of one of the girls, NHK said. The girls were students at Caritas Gakuen, a Catholic school in Kawasaki city, south of Tokyo, and were waiting to board their school bus when the suspect attacked, school officials said at a news conference. “I’m extremely angry and feel the utmost regret that this brutal act caused harm to innocent children and to their guardians who lovingly nurtured them,” said school director Tetsuro Saito. The motive for the attack was unclear but there were no immediate fears of a wider security threat. Most mass killings involve knives or swords due to Japan’s strict gun laws, and sometimes target vulnerable people.  The Asahi and Nikkei newspapers quoted a witness saying he saw a middle-aged man with a knife scream, “I’ll kill you!” Other media reports said the man had knives in both hands.  Satoru Shitori, the school headmaster, said he was near the bus stop at the time of the attack and did not hear the man shout anything. “He did not speak, cry out or shout. He did not say a word. That’s why children did not notice” the suspect, who attacked them from behind, Shitori said. “If he had come shouting, the children might have been able to escape,” he said.    The suspect, a resident of Kawasaki, was found unconscious near the scene and died later from a self-inflicted stab wound to his neck, NHK reported, citing police. Prime Minister Shinzo Abe described the attack as “extremely harrowing” and promised to tighten security for children commuting to and from school. TV footage showed scores of police officers and emergency vehicles at the scene, with large areas cordoned off. A witness told NHK he saw people lying on the ground covered in blood and a police officer was hosing down the sidewalk. Violent crime is relatively rare in Japan but occasional high-profile incidents have shocked the nation. In 2016, a man armed with a knife broke into a facility for the disabled in a small town near Tokyo and killed 19 patients in their sleep.  And in 2010, more than a dozen people were injured in a stabbing spree on a school bus and a commuter bus in a Tokyo suburb. Two children were killed and a dozen injured in western Japan earlier this month after a car involved in an accident with another vehicle skidded into a nursery school group out for a walk with their teachers.

7292,"England thrash Afghanistan by 9 wickets, with 195 balls remaining","England defeated Afghanistan by 9 wickets and with 195 balls remaining in a World Cup warm-up match in London on Monday. Afghanistan were dismissed for 160 in 38.4 overs, with Joe Root and Jofra Archer taking three wickets each. England opener Jason Roy smashed an unbeaten 89 off 46 balls including 11 fours and four sixes to help England win.",The Guardian,"The bars are stocked, the bunting is up, each last little part of the Oval and every other ground has been swathed in ICC branding, and the names of all existing, conflicting sponsors covered over with black tape. Everything is ready. And so are England.“We have been for the last week,” Eoin Morgan said, “and, if we didn’t play these last warm-up games, we’d still be in a position where we felt confident enough to win going into that first game against South Africa.” They won their final practice match, against Afghanistan, by nine wickets and, better yet, they also had confirmation that Morgan and Mark Wood will be fit to play the opening match on Thursday.It was, Morgan said, “the best possible news”. He was pretty worried when he injured his finger in training last Friday. “It looked worse than it was. I’m lucky it was a dislocation and not a break,” but the doctor popped the joint back in. He was able to play on Monday, although he did not actually get to bat. Nor did Wood bowl but he was able to train. “I jarred my foot when I bowled a slower ball,” he explained, “I thought I might have tweaked my soleus muscle in my calf but the scans couldn’t have been any better.”As warm-ups go, this last one was a gentle bend-over to touch the toes. After that fraught weekend, when they lost two players to injuries and a match to Australia, it was just what they needed. The only problem was, Morgan said, that his fast bowlers did not get enough of a work-out. Jofra Archer still managed to do plenty in the time he had. Afghanistan were two down by the end of his opening spell, which he seemed to enjoy a lot more than the Afghan batsmen did. They spent most of it ducking underneath bouncers and backing away to leg to try to find space to play in.Archer had both Hazratullah Zazai and Rahmat Shah caught at mid-on, and then he hit Hashmatullah Shahidi flush in the box. When Ben Stokes came on first change, Noor Ali Zadran played on and Afghanistan were 49 for three. It got worse. They lost four wickets for four runs in eight balls. Some of this damage was self-inflicted. Hashmatullah was run out by Liam Plunkett trying to sneak an unnecessary second run, then Najibullah Zadran made a similar mistake taking on Jonny Bairstow’s throw. In between, Gulbadin Naib flapped a catch to long-on, and then Rashid Khan sliced his first ball to slip.Afghanistan were 92 for eight then, so did well to make it all the way to 160. That was down to Mohammad Nabi, who batted as if he was angry at how wrong it had all gone and blazed three brilliant sixes, the best of them a preposterous flat drive over extra cover off Adil Rashid. He had a little help from the No 11, Dawlat Zadran, but in the end Morgan whistled up Archer again and he soon finished things off. Nabi top-edged a catch to third man, where Bairstow took the ball once, threw it up, then stepped back over the boundary and back into play to catch it again.Afghanistan were all out in 38.4 overs and England needed just over half that number to make the runs. They lost only one wicket along the way. Bairstow was stumped by Rahmat Shah off Nabi’s off-spin. Not that Shah could claim much credit for it. The ball bounced out of his gloves as if it had hit a brick wall and ricocheted into the stumps just as Bairstow’s toes were in the air. The dismissal did not slow England too much. Jason Roy, who made 89 off 46 balls, batted like a man with a tee-time to make. Maybe he was. Morgan said a lot of the squad were going to spend Tuesday playing golf.England seem honed to a sharp point, they look ready, and sound relaxed. Morgan said he expected they would all feel a little more nervous when the tournament finally starts on Thursday, but they are prepared for that too. “I’ve always said the first game of a World Cup feels different from any other game, so naturally you do think more about it and how it will look on the day,” he said. “Everybody’s going to feel that anticipation, and that excitement of playing the first game. It will be different than any other day. It will be great. I will be encouraging guys to embrace it.”… we have a small favour to ask.

The reserve price of these properties, mostly residential units, ranged from ₹16 lakh to about ₹8 crore.

The national carrier could sell less than 10 of the 56 properties that were put up for sale in April, according to two people directly aware of the development.The reserve price of these properties, mostly residential units, ranged from  ₹16 lakh to about  ₹8 crore and were located in cities such as Mumbai, Delhi, Pune, Bengaluru, Chennai and Kolkata.“The high reserve prices for the properties were not in tune with current market conditions and was the primary reason for the lacklustre response. Less than 10 units were actually sold at the end,"" said the first of the two people cited above, a senior Air India official.The auction oversight committee would meet soon to decide if some of the properties were to be re-auctioned, said the second person requesting anonymity. The money-losing airline had put up for sale a plot that has 14 flats with a total built-up area of 2,030 sq. m in Pali Hill, an upscale neighbourhood in Mumbai.Properties located in other prominent parts of the city, including Mahim, Bandra, Prabha Devi, Colaba and Khar, were also on the block. Similarly, the airline had offered five flats at New Delhi’s Asian Games Village complex, a flat at Chennai’s Besant Nagar and 10 flats at Kolkata’s Golf Green area, for sale.An Air India spokesperson didn’t respond to Mint’ s queries till press time. The airline has generated about  ₹450 crore from the sale of properties since 2012, when the government announced a turnaround plan for the debt-ridden national carrier, said the second person.Properties that remained unsold in the April auction would be put on the block again in a few months, according to Air India employees handling the auction process. Prices of some of the properties, especially those in tier I cities, are very high because they are located in prime locations, say real estate consultants.“The fact that many of the assets the airline owns are in prime locations does not help, as any ‘discount’ on such prominent assets would set benchmarks that other commercial asset owners in these localities would not react well to, as a lower reserve price would affect the market value of similar assets,"" said a Mumbai-based property consultant on condition of anonymity.“There are also smaller assets owned by the airline such as residential quarters for staff,"" the consultant said. “However, interested buyers may also hope that the government, which owns the airline, will bundle these assets as an added incentive if and when it makes a final decision to sell off the airline. So far, the interest in buying the airline’s real estate assets has been far from spectacular."" Meanwhile, the government plans to raise up to  ₹10,000 crore by selling Air India’s subsidiaries and other assets, including real estate, to repay part of the carrier’s debt of  ₹29,000 crore that the government had taken over from the airline, reports said earlier in May. The airline had earlier set a target of  ₹500 crore through the sale of land assets in FY19.“We haven’t quite met the target set for FY 19 through sale of land assets, though we were successful in selling some real estate assets,"" said the senior Air India official cited earlier. “But a lot of properties that were earlier entangled in legal issues and couldn’t be put on the block have now been sorted. Almost all title deeds for our real estate meant to be put on the block are in place."" The official did not elaborate on the amount raised from selling real estate assets in FY19. The official added that Air India expected to raise an additional  ₹500 crore from the sale of real estate assets in FY20.

American tariffs on Chinese goods could go up ""very, very substantially, very easily"", Trump further said.",Bloomberg Quint,"(Bloomberg) -- The U.S. isn’t ready to make a trade deal with China, President Donald Trump said while on a state visit to Japan.“I think they probably wish they made the deal that they had on the table before they tried to renegotiate it,” Trump said Monday at a joint press conference in Tokyo alongside Japanese leader Shinzo Abe. “They would like to make a deal. We’re not ready to make a deal.”Trump said American tariffs on Chinese goods “could go up very, very substantially, very easily.” His comments came after trade talks between the two countries stalled earlier this month. Each side has since blamed the other, and Trump has threatened billions more in tariffs.Read more: Abe to Charm Trump With Sumo, Warships as Trade Spat LoomsTrump said businesses were leaving China for countries without tariffs, including the U.S. and Asian neighbors including Japan. Still, he also expressed optimism that the world’s biggest economies would eventually reach an agreement.“I think sometime in the future China and the United States will absolutely have a great trade deal, and we look forward to that,” Trump said. “Because I don’t believe that China can continue to pay these, really, hundreds of billions of dollars in tariffs. I don’t believe they can do that.”For some time, the U.S. “has had various voices on China-U.S. trade talks. Sometimes it is said that an agreement will be reached soon, and sometimes that it is difficult to reach an agreement,” Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Lu Kang said in Beijing Monday when asked about Trump’s comments.“In the same period of time, China’s position has always been the same,” Lu said. “China has always believed that the differences between any two countries should of course be resolved through friendly consultations and negotiations.”Over the weekend, China pushed back at the perception that Trump’s tariffs are hurting its economy.Higher tariffs will have a “very limited” impact, and would hurt the U.S. about as much, according to Guo Shuqing, head of China’s banking and insurance regulator. Guo is the highest-ranking Chinese financial official to publicly comment on the trade standoff since talks deteriorated.Earlier: China Regulator Downplays Trade War Impact, Warns on FXA commentary published by the official Xinhua News Agency accused the U.S. of “scapegoating” China for its trade imbalance and even some domestic economic issues, as Chinese state media urges unified resistance to foreign pressure.“The United States is attempting to squeeze an unequal trade deal out of China, using measures such as tariff hikes and targeting its tech companies,” it said, while praising Beijing’s “utmost sincerity” in the negotiations.China has escalated its anti-U.S. discourse since the talks faltered and Trump blacklisted Huawei Technologies Co. and scores of its affiliates earlier this month in a bid to stymie its access to the U.S. market.

Manmohan's current term will end on June 14.",The New Indian Express,"GUWAHATI: The Congress will not nominate former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh to the Rajya Sabha from Assam.His current term – and also that of another Assam Congress MP Santius Kujur – will end on June 14 next.“The Congress will not nominate anyone this time around. This is because we don’t have the numbers (in Assembly),” senior Assam Congress spokesman Apurba Kumar Bhattacharya told Express. There is a possibility that Congress will nominate Singh from another state where it has the numbers.In the 126-member Assam House, Congress has 25 MLAs compared to the combined 87 MLAs of ruling alliance which is made up of BJP (61), Asom Gana Parishad (14) and Bodoland People’s Front (12). The All India United Democratic Front (AIUDF) has 12 MLAs while there is an independent MLA who is lending his support to the ruling alliance.So, even if Congress and AIUDF come together with a consensus candidate, they cannot ensure his victory. Speculations are rife that the ruling alliance will nominate former MPs Birendra Prasad Baishya of AGP and Kamakhya Prasad Tassa of BJP in the two seats.Singh has been representing Assam in the Upper House since 1991. The last time he got elected was on May 30, 2013 when the Congress was in power in the state and it had a large number of legislators.Singh was first offered a Rajya Sabha seat in 1991 by the then Assam Chief Minister Hiteswar Saikia and following his election, he was appointed as Union Finance Minister. As there was then a law that said a person getting elected to Parliament from a state has to be its ordinary resident, Saikia had made Singh a tenant in his house which is located at Sarumotoria locality of Guwahati. Singh and his wife Gursharan Kaur are voters in the Dispur Legislative Assembly constituency in the city. They had come to Guwahati recently to exercise their franchise in Lok Sabha elections.

Patanjali toned milk will be available from May 28 in major cities including Delhi-NCR.",The Financial Express,"Baba Ramdev has raised the competition for rival milk brands such as Amul and Mother Dairy with the launch of the toned variant of Patanjali’s cow milk, the company announced. The Ayurveda company will also launch the full-cream variant soon along with a proposed ‘herbal milk’, Baba Ramdev added. The new addition to the company’s portfolio will be available for customers of Delhi NCR, Rajasthan, and some parts of Haryana and Maharashtra from 28 May.Talking about the rival brands, Baba Ramdev said that he promotes competition and does not see either Amul or Mother Dairy as rivals. “There must be healthy competition among us since Mother Dairy and Amul are not ‘videshi’ brands”. However, Patanjali said that Cargill Oils and Wilmar will be seen as competitors for their foreign origin and Patanjali will continue to fight in the FMCG category. Patanjali said that its own plants in Maharashtra, Rajasthan, and Meerut will process the milk. Also, Patanjali will be directly sourcing the produce from the dairy farmers cutting the need of a middle man. “This is a revolution and historical moment in the dairy industry,” Baba Ramdev said. Patanjali is purchasing about 4 lakh litre of milk as of now and looks to notch it up to 10 lakh litre. Addressing reporters, Baba Ramdev said that the rival companies increased their milk prices because Patanjali was giving better remuneration to dairy farmers which forced others to do the same. Baba Ramdev also said that Patanjali will be selling the milk cheaper by Rs 4 as compared to Amul. Previously, Acharya Balkrishna said that the company is gradually recovering from the after-effects of a consumer slowdown. Patanjali MD Acharya Balkrishna acknowledged the FMCG sector’s sluggish growth and said that the Baba Ramdev-founded company is also reeling under it. “There has been a difference and Patanjali has faced it too. We are gradually coming out of the effects of the slowdown,” he said in an interview to a TV channel. However, with the rising interest in herbal and natural products, the company said that the market for these products will not go down in the future.

It has changed the very grammar of electoral politics in India. Traditional discourse of politics earlier used to remain confined to socialism, welfarism and patronage. This time it has gone far beyond all this as people have realised that development alone can bring a real change in their lives,” Sahasrabuddhe said.Development and nationalism are now the centre stage of the country’s political discourse, he added.Sahasrabuddhe underlined that this verdict has cornered identity politics and a new model of politics engineered by the BJP based on development and nationalism has emerged.The Narendra Modi-led central government has ensured that development becomes a part of one’s everyday life bringing it at the experiential level, the BJP vice president said.After Jawaharlal Nehru and Indira Gandhi, Narendra Modi is the third prime minister of the country who has been able to retain power for a second term with full majority in Lok Sabha.Development has also given people a new aspirational identity. Instead of being known by their caste, they feel better to be identified as those who have gas cylinders or electricity at their homes, he said, adding that this has enhanced their social dignity as well.Sahasrabuddhe, who is the president of the Indian Council for Cultural Relations (ICCR), is in-charge of BJP’s policy research and good governance departments.Recalling the party’s journey, he said the BJP is no more “untouchable” and is the preference of every section of society.",https://www.india.com/news/india/lok-sabha-poll-result-has-changed-political-discourse-vinay-sahasrabuddhe-3672432/?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

""It's never easy in the first year, to come to a new country and new league, new football, new culture,"" Alonso said.",Times Now,"It has been rumoured by several media outlets that Chelsea manager Maurizio Sarri might leave the club in the summer. This comes after a season where Chelsea finished 3rd in the Premier League and made it into the finals of 2 tournaments (League Cup and Europa League). But his style of play has been criticised by the fans and after a 0-6 drubbing at the hands of Manchester City, it was thought to be the final nail in the coffin for him.However, Chelsea’s form improved after that game and they went on to finish inside the top-four. But now Sarri has been rumoured to return to Italian football and become the next Juventus boss after Massimiliano Allegri’s sacking. But why has Sarri found it difficult to get his methods across in England? Chelsea defender Marcos Alonso claims that the Italian found Chelsea a steep learning curve which was even made tougher because he never played top-level football. 60-year-old Sarri is a former banker and never played professional football. “It’s never easy in the first year, to come to a new country and new league, new football, new culture. It is many different things. The gaffer is still learning, he was not a football player either so he is learning a lot this year,” said Alonso.Alonso has also found it difficult to adjust to Sarri’s instructions this season. After a stupendous time under Conte, Alonso failed to nail down a starting place in the Chelsea side this year. He managed to score four goals this season compared to eight last year but still appeared 31 times in the Premier League for Chelsea. Explaining his downfall in form, Alonso said that he found it difficult in the middle part of the season.“It’s not easy, of course not. We are 11 players in there. We have to all try to go in the same direction. Managers are different, they have different aspects of tactics. He wanted to change the team, not just me. He wanted to change the way.

As far as I am aware, the sum was paid to the respective Boards after going through the necessary legal framework,"" he said in an email response to PTI.A tax of over  ₹500 crore was deposited with the Income Tax Department pertaining to this transaction, he said.He said the issue cropped up when a member of the COA raised queries with regard to the requirement of travel of the CFO to Australia probably with a view to see ""if it was frivolous"".""It is only when the travel was questioned that some really strange ideas started erupting out of nowhere for the first time ever and it appears that an effort was made to propagate those ideas,"" he said. ""It is my view that someone wishes to obfuscate this issue for some purpose and therefore is attempting to plant things that may not be factually correct.""Emails sent to COA and its chief executive officer Rahul Johri for comments remained unanswered.Under FEMA, overseas remittances are categorised as capital account transactions, for which RBI permission is needed, or current account transactions, which banks are authorised to approve.BCCI had in 2008 started CLT20 as a joint venture with CA and CSA. BCCI held 50 per cent stake in the joint venture while CA had 30 per cent and CSA the remaining 20 per cent.Apart from the participation fee that the teams from Australia and South Africa got, their respective boards were paid the surplus. This surplus was transferred as 'additional participation fee'.But since BCCI's rules and regulations did not allow the board to form such joint ventures a sub-committee -- CLT20 Governing Council -- was formed. The panel had former BCCI head N Srinivasan, former IPL commissioner Lalit Modi, and two other members.None of the current BCCI functionaries were on the board when the CLT20 was scrapped and its accounts settled in 2015.This story has been published from a wire agency feed without modifications to the text.

This had reportedly caused US officials to ask Kunlun to sell Grindr. Reportedly, the Committee on Foreign Investment in the US was worried the database may have military and intelligence personnel data which Chinese government may get.",Engadget,"When the US pushed Grindr's owner to sell the app over national security concerns, it made only vague allusions to what might have prompted the decision.  Now, however, the situation is clearer.  Reuters sources have claimed that Beijing Kunlun triggered alarms after it gave engineers in Beijing access to Grindr's database for several months.  While there wasn't evidence that the company misused the data, the tipsters believe the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) was worried that the Chinese government could comb the database to find info on US intelligence and military personnel.CFIUS ordered Beijing Kunlun to restrict access to the database in September, according to the insiders.  The Grindr team complied and functionally separated Grindr, but by February its parent company had decided to close the Beijing office entirely over policy and privacy concerns.  The effort was for nothing, though, as CFIUS reportedly asked Beijing Kunlun to sell off Grindr in March.As for skipping the review process?  The sources said that CFIUS reviews for submission were strictly optional, and Beijing Kunlun didn't think the deal would pose a national security risk at the time.The parent company hasn't commented on the report so far, but a spokeswoman for Grind said that data privacy and security ""is and always will be a top priority.""The explanation still leaves Grindr with an uncertain fate, but it does shed light on just why the US was nervous.  It also reflects the US government's increasingly strict approach to Chinese companies -- it doesn't want even the slightest risk of China's having access to private information.",https://www.engadget.com/2019/05/26/grindr-owner-selloff-explained/?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts
