Security tests have also not found evidence the app uploads a user’s entire camera roll.', 'FaceApp goes on to specify that it “might” store the photos users have chosen to upload in the cloud for a short period, claiming this is done for “performance and traffic” — such as to make sure that a user doesn’t repeatedly upload the same photo to carry out another edit.', '“Most images are deleted from our servers within 48 hours from the upload date,” it adds.', 'It also claims no user data is “transferred to Russia”, even though its R&D team is based there.

Update: Founder Yaroslav Goncharov told us it uses AWS and Google Cloud.)', '“We don’t sell or share any user data with any third parties,” it adds.', 'FaceApp also says users can request their data is deleted.

FaceApp performs most of the photo processing in the cloud. We only upload a photo selected by a user for editing. We never transfer any other images from the phone to the cloud.', '2. We might store an uploaded photo in the cloud. The main reason for that is performance and traffic: we want to make sure that the user doesn’t upload the photo repeatedly for every edit operation. Most images are deleted from our servers within 48 hours from the upload date.', '3. We accept requests from users for removing all their data from our servers. Our support team is currently overloaded, but these requests have our priority. For the fastest processing, we recommend sending the requests from the FaceApp mobile app using “Settings->Support->Report a bug” with the word “privacy” in the subject line. We are working on the better UI for that.', '4. All FaceApp features are available without logging in, and you can log in only from the settings screen.
