4 days after winning World Cup, Bayliss appointed SRH head coach
Four days after leading England to 2019 World Cup victory, Trevor Bayliss has been appointed as SunRisers Hyderabad head coach. The 56-year-old Australian's tenure with England will come to an end after the Ashes. It will be Bayliss' second stint in the Indian Premier League, having already led KKR to two IPL titles during his tenure from 2012 to 2015.

CricTracker
The Sunrisers Hyderabad (SRH) has appointed England’s World Cup-winning coach Trevor Bayliss as the head coach of the franchise. This comes as a surprising move as the team had done well under the watchful eyes of Tom Moody over the last few years. SRH won the Indian Premier League (IPL) title in 2016 and also made it to the final in 2018 under him. The franchise has now parted ways with Moody and signed Bayliss for the top job.
Tom Moody was with the franchise for the last seven years and during his stint, SRH qualified for the playoffs on five occasions and won the trophy under David Warner‘s captaincy in 2016. In a press release which confirmed Trevor Bayliss’ appointment, the franchise thanked Moody for his superb work with the team and wished the former Australian cricketer for his future endeavours.

“We would like to thank Tom Moody, who has made an enormous impact with the franchise, helping us achieve 5 playoff appearances over the past 7 years including a much treasured championship in 2016. We would also like to thank him for his work ethic and leadership over our journey and wish him all the success moving forward,” the press release read.
Trevor Bayliss has been at the centre stage of England’s resurgence in the limited-overs format. He, along with captain Eoin Morgan, turned the fortunes of the team and they deservedly won the World Cup only a few days ago at Lord’s. Bayliss is likely to resign from the helm post the Ashes series and the SRH has grabbed the opportunity to sign him for the upcoming season.
“After very careful consideration, the SunRisers franchise has decided to take a new direction with the Head Coaching role and will be parting ways with the services of Tom Moody. Trevor Bayliss, England’s 2019 World Cup-winning coach, has been appointed Head Coach of SunRisers Hyderabad. Trevor has already won 2 IPL trophies with KKR and has also won the Big Bash League and Champions League with Sydney Sixers.
“He is a proven winner and we feel that his successful track record will be ideal in taking SunRisers Hyderabad forward,” the release further read. The SRH will now be hoping that Bayliss continues his good run as the coach with them as well and work wonders with the team in IPL 2020.

England and New Zealand played out the most thrilling World Cup final ever at Lord’s on July 14. Both the teams scored 241 runs in their allotted 50 overs and the match went to the super over. They scored the same number of runs in the super over as well only for the hosts to pip the opponents on the boundary count and win the trophy for the first time. The Kiwis were hard done with the absurd rules and their fans were in shock back home on Monday morning.
Jimmy Neesham was in the middle of the action in the super over and the southpaw had given a realistic chance for his team by hitting a six off Jofra Archer early. However, at the same time, the cricketer’s high school teacher Dave Gordon was battling with life and took his last breath after Neesham smacked a six in the super over.

“One of the nurses came in for the final over, the super over, and she said his breathing is changing. You know, I think Jimmy Neesham had just hit that six and he took his last breath,” Gordon’s daughter Leonie Gordon was quoted as saying by stuff.co.nz.
Jimmy Neesham who was heartbroken after the World Cup final and put up a series of tweets in disappointments also paid tribute to his teacher on social media. “Dave Gordon, my High School teacher, coach and friend. Your love of this game was infectious, especially for those of us lucky enough to play under you. How appropriate you held on until just after such a match. Hope you were proud. Thanks for everything. RIP,” Neesham’s tweet read.

Leonie Gordon was also heartened to see Neesham’s tribute and said, “It was lovely, you know, he’s kept in touch with Jimmy and he is friends with Jimmy’s father. He always had a soft spot for Jimmy Neesham, he was very proud of him. He would definitely be following his career,” she further said.
Dave Gordon taught at Auckland Grammar for as many as 25 years where he coached a few young New Zealand cricketers as well and Lockie Ferguson was also one of his students.

New Delhi [India], July 18 (ANI): Union Minister Gen (retired) VK Singh on Thursday hailed the Kulbhushan Jadhav verdict and asserted that the positive judgment may make Pakistan realize their mistake.Speaking to ANI on the International Court of Justice's verdict delivered yesterday, Singh said, "The judgement is positive. With a judgment of 15:1 they have supported what we have said. It is visible that ICJ has honoured the basic conventions of law and justice and India has been successful in its mission".On being asked about whether India will further exhort more pressure on Pakistan for resolution of this issue, he said, "The way they had abducted Kulbhushan and filed a fake case, we believe something must be done about it. Hopefully, Pakistan will realise the mistake that they have made and will take action to ensure that Kulbhushan Jadhav gets justice and is returned to India. "His reaction comes after the ICJ on Wednesday continued its stay on the execution of the Indian national Kulbhushan Jadhav, held in a Pakistani jail on allegations of spying, and called for an effective review and reconsideration of the conviction.Jadhav, 49, was purportedly "arrested" from Balochistan by Pakistani security forces on March 3, 2016, after he allegedly entered the country from Iran, as claimed by Islamabad.India has held that Pakistan, which faces several problems on its border with Iran, has been using Jadhav's case to blame India for its problems in Balochistan. It has used proxy groups such as Jaish al Adl against Iran, while Iranian officials have spoken of Pakistan's sponsorship of terror activities along the Iran-Pakistan border.It was on March 25, 2016, that then Foreign Secretary of Pakistan, Aizaz Ahmad Chaudhry, had informed the Indian High Commissioner in Islamabad of Jadhav's "arrest."Since then, Pakistan has not offered any explanation as to why Islamabad took over three weeks to inform the Indian High Commissioner about Jadhav's arrest.Jadhav was sentenced to death by a Pakistani military court on April 11, 2017.Following this, India on May 8, 2017, approached the ICJ against Pakistan "for egregious violations of the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations, 1963" in the matter.India alleged that Pakistan is in breach of Article 36(1) (b) of the Vienna Convention, which obliged Pakistan to inform India of the arrest of Jadhav "without delay".

Veteran Congress leader and MLA from BTM Layout in Bengaluru Ramalinga Reddy on Wednesday evening announced that he would continue with the Congress party. It is also confirmed that Reddy has assured the Congress that he will vote in favour of the trust vote. Reddy, who was one among the rebel legislators, had tendered his resignation to the Speaker on July 6 along with 11 other MLAs.
In a statement to the media, Ramalinga Reddy said that after several rounds of talks with the Congress leaders and the high command, he had decided to stay with the Congress.
“Due to several occurrences within the Congress party, I had resigned on July 6, 2019 as the MLA of BTM Layout. I have never sought or demanded a ministerial post. I have been with the Congress party for the last 45 years and I have been an MLA seven times. I had only resigned as an MLA but I had never said I would move away from the Congress,” Ramalinga Reddy’s statement reads.
The veteran leader and former Home Minister of the state also said that he had received several pleas from party workers requesting him to withdraw his resignation. However, Reddy did not specify whether he would withdraw his resignation.
“I have received numerous letters and pleas from party workers who have asked me to withdraw my resignation. Several leaders from the party have also asked me to do the same. In light of these developments, I would like to say that I will continue with the Congress party,” the statement said.
Speaking to the media, Ramalinga Reddy said that he would not make any announcement about his resignation to the media and that he would first discuss it with the Speaker.
“I tendered my resignation to the Speaker. I will not talk about whether I am withdrawing my resignation or not. I will discuss it with the Speaker and then make an announcement,” Ramalinga Reddy added.
Unlike the other rebels who resigned and flew to Mumbai stay at Renaissance Hotel, Ramalinga Reddy had remained in Bengaluru and persisted that he was with the Congress party.

Google had repeatedly faced heavy criticism over its decision to create a censored search engine to comply with Chinese laws. Google CEO Sundar Pichai, in late 2018, had said work on the project was "limited".

I never want to be involved in a Super Over ever again: Ben Stokes
England all-rounder Ben Stokes, who was named Man of the 2019 World Cup final, has said he never wants to be involved in a Super Over ever again. The 28-year-old hit eight runs in Super Over against New Zealand. He further revealed he had suggested captain Eoin Morgan to send Jos Buttler and Jason Roy to play the Super Over.

On July 14, Sunday, the world saw probably the best ODI of all time between England and New Zealand, which was also the final of the ICC World Cup 2019. The hosts were chasing a meagre total of 242 runs set by the Kiwi team and the initial match ended up in a tie, the first for any final in tournament history and in another first in ODI history, Super Over was employed to find the champions.
Henry Nicholls made a valiant fifty in the finals as England bowlers kept the pressure on the hosts, who were looking for their first-ever world title. Somehow, they posted 241/8 in 50 overs. Their bowlers reduced England to 89/4 and then in pressure, Ben Stokes and Jos Buttler added over 100 runs to bring the team back in the final. However, Kiwis pegged the batsmen back and Stokes managed to make the 15 runs required in the last over, when 16 were needed and the match was tied, with everything coming down to the super over.

When the super over was employed for the very first time in the ODI cricket history, England batted first and needed to send two batsmen to take advantage of the six balls. However, the England all-rounder Ben Stokes revealed that he wasn’t ready to go out there and bat again with Jos Buttler, as he was angry at not finishing the game.
“I was annoyed at myself, I was angry, I thought I’d thrown it away but when I went upstairs I had to give myself five minutes because Morgs (Morgan) wanted me to go back out and do the super over. I said that we should send Jos [Buttler] and Jason [Roy] out but Morgs said we need a left and right because it’s a small boundary. I had to go out the back into the shower room and give myself five minutes. ‘I never want to be involved in one [super over] ever again,” the 28-year-old all-rounder was quoted as saying by timesnownews.
England managed 15 runs in 6 balls with Stokes hitting a six off Boult. In return, New Zealand tried their best with Neesham making 13 runs and hitting Archer for a six. However, Martin Guptill was run out coming for the second run which would have made New Zealand champions and the super over was tied. England won the contest on the basis of hitting more boundaries in the match than the Kiwis, which was seen as a controversial ruling by many.

Abdul Razzaq reveals he has had 5-6 affairs after marriage
Former Pakistan all-rounder Abdul Razzaq, during a TV programme, said that he has had "five-six affairs that also had a validity of 1-1.5 years". He further said that all those affairs happened after he got married. "How do people laugh and clap at such statements? Won't be laughing when they're at [the] receiving end," a user tweeted reacting to it.

Former Pakistan all-rounder Abdul Razzaq had said after his country’s heavy defeat to arch-rivals India in the cricket World Cup 2019 that he would like to coach Hardik Pandya to make him as one of the best all-rounders in world cricket. Razzaq had also made a controversial remark after India’s loss to England that seamer Mohammed Shami performed well in the match because he is a Muslim (Shami took 5 for 69 in that game). Razzaq’s frustration was understandable since Pakistan’s chances of making the quarter-finals had taken a huge blow after India lost the match.
And now, the 39-year-old former cricketer has confessed that will certainly put the cricketing world on fire once again. Razzaq made his bold confession while speaking on a TV programme. The former batting all-rounder said he has had five-six extramarital affairs that also had a validity of 1-1.5 years. And when the astonished anchor asked him whether those had happened before marriage, Razzaq said they had happened after his conjugal life started.

Razzaq’s confessions took all those who present on the show by surprise. The man had represented Pakistan in 46 Tests, 265 ODIs and 32 T20Is. He scored over 8,000 runs and took 389 wickets in international cricket.
In a matter of coincidence, Hardik Pandya too had made a similar confession on a reality show back in January. He was accused of making sexist remarks related to women and the episode had seen him getting suspended, along with KL Rahul who was also on the programme, although temporarily.
He missed the ODI series in Australia and a couple of games in New Zealand and it was a big blow for the cricketer who was just about to make a comeback after a long stint with an injury. Nevertheless, Hardik made it to the World Cup and produced a decent performance for his team, both with the bat and ball.

About his coaching proposal for Hardik, Razzaq had said in his tweets: “Today I have been closely observing Pandya and I see a lot of faults in his body balance while hitting the bowl hard. I observed his footwork as well and I see that has also let him down sometimes. If I can give him coaching, for example in the UAE, I can make him one of the better all-rounders, if not the best. If the BCCI wants to make him a better all-rounder I will always be available.”

With various steps taken by the government for promotion of sports and its infrastructure in the country in the last 5 years, winning 100 Olympic medals by 2032 could be a possibility, Rajyavardhan Singh Rathore said in the Lok Sabha on Wednesday.
Participating in a debate on Demands for Grants of Ministry of Youth and Affairs, he said the Khelo India campaign launched by Prime Minister Narendra Modi has brought a remarkable change in the arena of sports.
Rathore, a former Youth and Sports Minister, said the Khelo India campaign initiated by the Modi government has changed the attitude of the country towards sports.
Thanking Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman for the proposal to set up a National Sports Education Board during her budgetary announcements, he said, it will help widen the scope of Khelo India campaign.
Besides, he said, the government has envisaged setting up of a sports school in every district.
Rathore, an Olympic medal winner, said there is no dearth of money for sports now with setting up of the National Sports Development Fund.
He expressed hope that winning 100 medals in 2032 Olympic Games can be a realty with various steps taken by the government and pool of talents available across the country.
Participating in the debate Danish Ali (BSP) asked the government to take steps to clean up various sports associations in the country.
Hibi Eden (Cong) said the government should desist from changing the name of Nehru Yuva Kendra which has been playing a major role.
The government’s move to remove the name of Nehru would be unholy on the part of the ruling party given the tremendous contribution the first Prime Minister made in shaping India, he added.

Daily Mail
Juventus will be known as 'Piemonte Calcio' on the next FIFA game after signing a naming rights deal with Pro Evolution Soccer. 
FIFA's traditional rival have stolen a march on their video game competitor, although the names and faces of Juventus players will stay realistic. 
The 2020 version of PES secured exclusive naming rights with an agreement between Konami and the Italian champions. 
Cristiano Ronaldo's Juventus have signed a name rights deal with Pro Evolution Soccer
This deal entitles PES to the name, kit, stadium and badge for Juventus in their game. 
The licensing issue has pushed many gamers to FIFA over the years as they enjoy playing with more realism. 
But PES are fighting back and over the past few seasons have incrementally started to claim rights of their own. 
Barcelona, Liverpool and Inter Milan have agreed partnerships from everything from team strips to crowd chants. 
But the fact that Juventus and Cristiano Ronaldo are now PES property will particularly rankle given that the striker has been a cover star for FIFA in the past. 
Gamers will now have to play as Piemonte Calcio if they want to use Juventus on FIFA

Court withdraws order to distribute Quran for bail over communal post
A Jharkhand court has modified its earlier order which had mandated a student, accused of writing a communal post on social media, to distribute five copies of the Holy Quran for bail. The court withdrew the order after the police filed an application saying it was difficult to implement the condition. Notably, the student had refused to obey the order.

Ranchi: A Ranchi court on Wednesday modified its earlier order which mandated distribution of copies of the Holy Quran by student named Richa Bharti, ANI reported. She was earlier arrested for allegedly uploading a communal post on social media.
“The I.O. has prayed that the condition of donating Holy Kuran by the petitioner may be done away with because of difficulties in its implementation. The petition of the I.O. has been forwarded by Id. AAP (sic),” the Court of Judicial Magistrate XXI, Ranchi said in a statement.

On July 12, Richa Bharti, a BCom student, was arrested following a complaint filed by a member of the Anjuman Committee for allegedly sharing a communal post on Facebook.
She was earlier ordered by the Court to distribute the Holy Quran as a condition for bail. However, she refused to abide by the verdict and reportedly approached the Jharkhand High Court for relief, Financial Express reported.

3 TN SRM Institute students kill themselves in same manner in 60 days
A 21-year-old student killed himself at Tamil Nadu's SRM Institute of Science and Technology's Kattankulathur campus on Monday, the third such incident there in a span of 60 days using the same method. The police said it has been understood that the victim had multiple arrears in his exam. In May, two students killed themselves inside the same campus.

The News Minute
On Monday, students and faculty at the SRM Institute of Science and Technology Kattankulathur campus (Kancheepuram district) woke up to devastating news. A 21-year-old student had killed himself in the campus. This was the third such incident inside the 250-acre campus in a span of 60 days, and all three students used the same method. While police sources say that the institute should have done more to avoid the deaths, faculty and some students tell TNM that this was not a case of institutional oversight.
Sree Raghav, a final year B.Tech student from Kanyakumari district, killed himself on Monday. The police are investigating the incident, but as per the first round of questioning, it has been understood that the victim had multiple arrears in his exam. In May, two students killed themselves inside the same Kattankulathur campus of the college, though different reasons were attributed to their suicides. The method that all three students used was the same, and all of them had accessed restricted areas of the campus.
(NOTE: TNM will not be revealing the method of suicide as mental health experts urge that such reporting may lead to more copycat suicides.)
A press statement from SRM Institute of Engineering and Technology expressed anguish over the incident and stated that as a policy, support and guidance is being offered by the college to students who are in need of counselling. However, speaking to TNM about Sree Raghav's suicide, a police officer at the Maraimalai Nagar station, in whose jurisdiction the college falls, said that the college should have been more careful in watching over its students.
"There have been two other suicides very recently in the same campus. The college should have installed preventive measures, and at least cordoned off restricted areas. But when our officers went for inquiry, they found that no such precautionary measures have been taken,” he said.
A professor at the college, however, told TNM that the institute had taken precautions, and the restricted area had been opened for some maintenance work only. The staff member, however, added that there is no clarity on how the students managed to access a restricted area in the previous two cases of suicides in the same campus.
A student of SRM said that students also get mailers frequently, telling them about counselling options available in case they need them. They also have a counsellor on campus, he said.
Psychological rehabilitation crucial
“People who are mentally disturbed or are in bereavement are vulnerable to copycat suicides. When they see others killing themselves, they tend to feel that it is the way out and follow them. Copycat suicides also happen among people who try it for fun and end up losing their lives,” explained Vandhana, a Chennai-based clinical psychologist. 
She added that following suicide attempts, while families and friends focus on physical health of the person who has survived, they do not focus as much on emotional well being.
“So what happens when the trauma is raw is that the next time they get triggered and attempt to kill themselves, it ends in death,” she said.
If you’re worried about a person’s mental health, there are some behavioural changes you can look out for.
Vandhana added that more suicide prevention helplines must be set up to address this issue in a holistic manner. Mass media must also do its part in preventing suicides, she added.
“Movies that give warning for alcohol and drugs, do not give similar warning for suicides. These warning one-liners don’t compensate for anything. We need to create more warning signs that are visible,” she said.
Making it clear that suicides do not happen in one day, Vandhana said that these build over a period of time and hence suicide prevention helplines must ideally double up and act as helplines which can aid people who need help to call and talk about their pain.

18-yr-old defender Gahlot becomes India's 2nd youngest goalscorer
India's 18-year-old defender Narender Gahlot on Tuesday became the second youngest footballer to score a goal for the national team. Gahlot achieved the feat after his 51st-minute header in India's last league match of 2019 Intercontinental Cup against Syria. Jerry Zirsanga, who scored aged 16 in May 2004, is the youngest footballer to score for India.

The 18-year-old Narender Gahlot on Tuesday became the second-youngest player to score an international goal for the Indian football team. Gahlot achieved the feat during the team’s match against Syria in the Intercontinental Cup at the EKR Arena in Ahmedabad.
He registered the goal as he headed Anirudh Thapa’s corner against Syria. This was Gahlot’s first goal for India. Mizoram’s Jerry Zirsanga holds the record for being the youngest player to register a goal for the Blue Tigers.
Jerry was 16 years and 311 days old when he scored the goal against Kuwait in 2004.
On Tuesday, India played a 1-1 draw against Syria in their last group stage match of the Intercontinental Cup.
The match witnessed a fanatic first half, as both teams had a flurry of chances, but neither team was able to convert their chances and at half-time, the scoreline read 0-0.
In the second half, Gahlot struck a goal for India, giving them lead of 1-0 in the game. Gahlot’s thumping header found the back of the net off the cross of Anirudh Thapa in the 51st minute.
However, Syria were awarded a penalty kick, against the run of play, in the 78th minute, and Firas made the most out of it, as he equalised bringing the scoreline to 1-1.
India ended their Intercontinental Cup campaign with two losses and one tied match to their credit.

Shubman should be groomed for India's no. 4 batting spot: Whatmore
Former Sri Lanka coach Dav Whatmore has said that batsman Shubman Gill should be groomed for Team India's number four batting position. "He has got the technique to be a number four...I am sure he will have a long career," he added. The 19-year-old Shubman was the player of the tournament in 2018 Under-19 World Cup.
https://www.crictracker.com/dav-whatmore-backs-shubman-gill-to-solve-indias-no-4-issue/?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts
CricTracker
The conundrum surrounding India’s number four continues to cause problems aplenty for the Team. The problem started right after Yuvraj Singh was dropped in mid-2017. Since then, India have tried out a number of batsmen without much success. The experimentation started with KL Rahul and later the likes of Dinesh Karthik, Hardik Pandya and Suresh Raina were tested. However, those experiments did not yield the desired result.
India then recalled Ambati Rayudu in 2018 and it looked like the team’s search was finally over. A good show in the Asia Cup, a fine century against West Indies and some handy knocks in Australia and New Zealand bolstered Rayudu’s reputation. However, the team surprisingly dropped him for the World Cup after his poor outing in the home series against Australia. India instead picked Vijay Shankar who looked anything but impressive in England before an injury ruled him out of the tournament.

India then tried out Rishabh Pant at that crucial position. The youngster played some handy knocks but clearly lacked the temperament to excel at number four. The middle-order was one of the reasons why India bowed out of the World Cup at the semifinal stage.
With India struggling to find a reliable number four, celebrated coach Dav Whatmore opines Shubman Gill can solve the problem. Whatmore rightly said that India failed to solve their middle-order woes. At the same time, he also had some words of praise for the Men in Blue’s performance in the World Cup.
“The No. 4 issue kept raising its head. India should look at the future. Shubman Gill is a fantastic young batsman and he could well fill that slot. He’s got the technique,” Whatmore was quoted as saying by Sportstar.
“India had a good tournament. It topped the group after nine matches, made runs, had a very good bowling attack, both pace and spin. But India ran into New Zealand in the semifinal, and the Kiwis made full use of helpful conditions. It’s just one defeat in a World Cup semifinal that can happen to any team. New Zealand did too much damage in the first 10 overs. India has got some powerful stroke makers and a potent attack. It should do very well in the coming days,” he added.

Telangana govt employees shoot TikTok videos at work; transferred
Several employees of the Telangana government's Khammam Municipal Corporation (KMC) were transferred and their wages were reduced after a series of their TikTok videos shot at work went viral on the internet. In the videos, they can be seen singing, dancing and playing pranks during office hours. According to KMC officials, 11 outsourced employees were found involved in the activity.

The News Minute
Officials are often seen engrossed in files in government offices in India but employees at a government office in Telangana surprised everyone and amused some, by filming and sharing TikTok videos.
Singing, dancing and playing pranks, employees of the Khammam Municipal Corporation (KMC) recorded the videos using TikTok app and uploaded them on the video sharing platform.
The videos featuring the employees, with film songs and dialogues playing in the background, were shot in the office during office hours. The videos went viral on social media.
Taking a serious note of this, the KMC cracked the whip on Tuesday by transferring the employees and also reducing their wages.
The issue even reached Khammam Collector R V Karnan through the media as Telugu channels found the videos and aired them.
According to KMC officials, 11 outsourced employees were found involved in the activity and all of them were shifted to other departments. KMC Commissioner J Srinivasa Rao said they were also punished by having their wages reduced.
The incident saw mixed reactions on social media as some appreciated the videos and said that it was just a little harmless fun at work, while others criticised the government officials for seemingly ignoring their duties.
The salaries of the employees who were transferred were also reduced. Some of them were in clerical positions, while others were involved in field work. They seem to have many such TikTok videos, many of whose screenshots are being shared on social media.
The videos themselves are not recent, but were found to be shot about two months ago, a senior official from KMC told PTI. The administration only came to know about the employees shooting the videos when they appeared in the media, and then issued a stern warning against such activities.

Kerala IPS officer Merin Joseph brings child rape accused from Saudi
A team led by Kollam Police Commissioner Merin Joseph arrested a man accused of raping a 13-year-old Kerala girl from Saudi Arabia and brought him to India on Tuesday. The accused, a Kollam native who works in Saudi Arabia, allegedly raped his friend's niece for three months in 2017. The child and her uncle later committed suicide.
https://www.thenewsminute.com/article/kerala-ips-officer-merin-goes-saudi-nab-child-rape-accused-brings-him-india-105608?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts
The News Minute
On Sunday, Kollam Police Commissioner Merin Joseph IPS and her team left to Riyadh in Saudi Arabia. Merin was unsure of the procedures that would follow once she landed in Riyadh, but one thing she was sure of, she would return to India with Sunil Kumar Bhadran (38), a man wanted in a child rape case.
Sunil Kumar, a native of Kollam, was a tile worker in Saudi Arabia. In 2017, while he was holidaying in Kerala, he sexually assaulted his friend’s niece for three months. 
The 13-year-old girl, who belonged to a scheduled caste community, was devastated and finally revealed her ordeal to her family. By the time the police issued a lookout notice, Sunil had fled to Saudi Arabia.  The girl was later moved to Government Mahila Mandiram rescue home at Karicode in Kollam district. However, she killed herself in June 2017. Before this, the victim’s paternal uncle who had introduced Sunil Kumar to the family had also killed himself.
Merin, who took charge as the Kollam Commissioner in June 2019, had reviewed pending cases, with an emphasis on cases related to women and children.
“I found this case and got to know that this man was absconding for almost two years. This was a case that had impacted public conscience and people were outraged at the crime. The International Investigation Agency of the Kerala police had been following up with Saudi police, we just strengthened these efforts,” she explains.
Though an Interpol notice had been issued for Sunil Kumar in 2017, the case had never progressed. Many cases don’t progress though Interpol notices are issued, as it required continuous follow-up and  co-operation from the other country involved.
In 2010, then  Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and Saudi King Abdulla had signed the India- Saudi extradition treaty. Despite many Keralites who were wanted in cases in the state having fled to Saudi, no extradition has happened till now. A few days ago, the Kerala police was informed that Saudi police had Sunil in custody. Though most IPS officers would have sent junior officers to secure the man, Merin chose to go herself. 
“This was the first time that we would be doing such an extradition. I wanted to learn how it works so that I could, in turn, share the knowledge with my team. There was a lot of paperwork, it involved the CBI and the Interpol too. We also had to make documents to bring him back. This is why I decided to go. I am also passionate about cases involving women and children, and this was a man I believed should be brought back to face trial," she told TNM.
Sunil Kumar Bhadran has now become the first person to be extradited for a crime committed in Kerala. And this, will perhaps pave the way for many more criminals seeking refuge in Saudi to be brought back.

NCRB doesn't maintain specific data on lynching cases: MHA
MoS for Home Nityanand Rai on Wednesday said the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) doesn't maintain specific data of lynching incidents in the country. He said this in response to a question on whether mob lynchings have increased in the last six months. "State governments are responsible for prevention, detection and investigation of crimes and for prosecuting criminals," he added.

New Delhi: Mob Lynching again became a topic of discussion today in Rajya Sabha when Ministry of Home Affairs was asked if incidents have increased in the last six months.
The Ministry of Home Affairs said that ‘Police’ and ‘Public Order’ are State subjects under the seventh schedule of the constitution and State Governments are responsible for prevention, detection and investigation of crimes.
Minister of State (Home Affairs) Nityanand Rai, replying to the question of Rajya Sabha, said that the state governments are responsible for prosecuting the criminals through their law enforcement agencies.
“National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) does not maintain specific data with respect to lynching incidents in the country,” said Rai.

On Saturday, Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) chief had demanded a pan-India stringent to curb mob-lynching and said that mob lynching has emerged as a dreadful disease (bhayanak bimari) across the country, and the loss of lives in it is a matter of serious concern.”
Senior Congress Leader Salman Khurshid had opined that the mob lynching atmosphere prevails in small towns and villages in India, and not so much in ‘areas of Delhi, where we live or work’.
Last month, a 24-year-old Muslim man named Tabrez Ansari in Jharkhand died after a mob attacked him and forced him to chant ‘Jai Shri Ram’ over suspicion of theft.

Australia urges China to let Uighur mother and son leave country
The Australian government has called on China to let an ethnic Uighur mother and son to leave the country. Sadam Abdusalam, an Uighur-Australian, has made a public call for the release of his wife and son, whom he has never met. China is believed to have held nearly 10 lakh Uighur Muslims in detention camps in the Xinjiang province.

Sadam Abdusalam has been campaigning for months so his Uighur wife and their son can come to Australia
Australia's government on Wednesday called on China to allow an Australian child and his Uighur mother to leave the country, days after co-signing a letter denouncing Beijing's treatment of the Muslim minority.
China has rounded up an estimated one million Uighurs and other mostly Muslim Turkic-speaking minorities into re-education camps in tightly controlled Xinjiang region, in the country's northwest.
Sadam Abdusalam has campaigned for months for his Uighur wife, Nadila Wumaier, and their son Lutifeier, whom he has never met, to be allowed to come to Australia.
Australia's embassy has "formally requested that the Chinese authorities allow Ms Wumaier and her son (who is an Australian citizen) to travel to Australia", Foreign Minister Marise Payne said Wednesday.
The statement came after Abdusalam, an Australian citizen, shared his plight publicly for the first time during a documentary on the Xinjiang camps aired Monday on national broadcaster ABC.
He told AFP that his wife was taken in for questioning by Chinese authorities the following day, but was later released.
Payne said that she was aware of the reports that Wumaier was interrogated, but added that diplomats had no consular access rights as she was not an Australian citizen.
China's foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said at a regular press briefing in Beijing on Wednesday that he had not seen the Australian statement.
"If the Australian side provides China with detailed relevant information through bilateral channels, China will provide the necessary assistance," he said.
Canberra had initially denied citizenship to Lutifeier, who was born in Xinjiang in August 2017, but backtracked last year following a legal battle.
Foreign Minister Marise Payne said Canberra has formally asked China to allow Nadila Wumaier and Lutifeier to come to Australia
Abdusalam said he was "really happy" that Australia was taking action, but called on officials to do more.
"I'm going to keep trying to keep pressure on China and keep pressure on the Australian government," he told AFP.
"On 31 August he will be two years old," Abdusalam said of Lutifeier.
"I would like to see my son before 31 August so we can celebrate his birthday as a family."
Australian lawyers representing the family are urging Canberra to fast-track a visa for Wumaier.
"Bringing this family together safely is the goal," Marque Lawyers wrote on Twitter.
- Escalating tensions -
Canberra has traditionally been keen to avoid friction with its biggest trading partner, but tensions between the two countries have escalated over security concerns and Beijing's growing presence in the Pacific.
Australia was among 22 countries, along with Britain, Canada and Japan, that last week wrote to top United Nations officials condemning China's treatment of ethnic minorities.
Beijing downplays the camps as "vocational education centres" aimed at steering people away from religious extremism through job training, Mandarin lessons and law classes.
It has blocked Australian diplomats from visiting Xinjiang since early 2017 and said Monday's ABC programme on the facilities was "full of lies, distortion and bias".

MS Dhoni's parents want him to retire: Childhood coach Banerjee
Team India wicketkeeper-batsman MS Dhoni's childhood coach Keshav Banerjee has revealed that the former India captain's parents want their son to retire from international cricket. "Dhoni's parents told me that the entire media is saying that Dhoni should retire and they feel that the media is right. They said they can't handle their big property alone anymore," he added.

Over the last few days, there has been a lot of commotion surrounding MS Dhoni’s retirement from international cricket. The veteran, who turned 38 on July 7, recently plied his trade the World Cup, which India couldn’t win and bowed out following the semi-final defeat. The Men in Blue’s next series is versus the Windies and it’s not confirmed whether Dhoni will be a part of the fixtures or not.
It has recently been learned that the wicketkeeper may not remain an automatic choice and chief selector MSK Prasad will have a word with him on the matter. Even as Dhoni has been a recipient of extreme criticism of later, a number of eminent personalities including the likes of lyricist Javed Akhtar and singer Lata Mangeshkar, spoke in his favour. Dhoni has also been backed by skipper Virat Kohli.

Amidst all the hullaballoo regarding Dhoni’s position in the team, his parents don’t wish for their son to continue as India can’t handle the ‘big property’ anymore. Keshav Banerjee, his childhood coach from Ranchi, visited Dhoni’s family at their home on Sunday where they discussed the matter.
“Dhoni’s parents told me that the entire media is saying that he should retire, and we feel they’re right. They said we can’t handle this big property anymore,” Banerjee was quoted as saying in Sports Tak.
He asked them to hold their patience for one more year. “You’ve handled it for so long – around 10 to 12 years. You can do it another year,” he added. Banerjee also told Dhoni’s parents that the experienced campaigner should play until the 2020 edition of the T20 World Cup in Australia, which is scheduled to get underway on October 18.
Dhoni had a topsy-turvy run the World Cup 2019. He could only manage 273 runs in eight innings. He got the top score of 56* versus the Windies. In the semis against New Zealand at the Old Trafford in Manchester, he scored a half-century and kept his team alive. However, Martin Guptill pulled off a thunderous direct hit to run Dhoni out and also seal the fate of the encounter.

Woke up wondering if it was a bad dream: Williamson on World Cup final
Reacting to losing World Cup final on boundaries to England, New Zealand captain Kane Williamson said, "I woke up wondering if it was just a bad dream and it wasn't, was it?"

It was a heartbreaking loss for New Zealand in the World Cup 2019. A tie-breaker couldn’t break the tie in this humdinger of a game. Ultimately, England was declared the winner since they hit the more number of boundaries in the match. New Zealand’s skipper Kane Williamson still seems to have not gotten over the defeat and said he thought if it was a bad dream when he woke up the next day.
There were several factors which snatched the World Cup away from New Zealand. Some umpiring blunders, some serious misfortune and a few bad moves cost them dearly. It isn’t easy for any team to lose two World Cup finals in a row but nevertheless, it was an undeniably incredible final. The Kiwi players are still sinking in this bitter truth and can’t believe how fate played them. James Neesham seemed absolutely dejected and even came up with an emotional tweet after the loss.

Kane Williamson compared New Zealand’s loss to a ‘bad dream’ and spoke about how he’s been tackling with it in an interview with ESPNCricinfo. The Kiwi skipper spoke about the mixture of emotions after this loss. He still seemed to be bewildered with whatever has happened and is finding it hard to believe it.
“I sort of explained it to a few people, it’s like sort of hits you in waves. You feel like, 10 minutes, you forget about it and then you make little jokes and then it comes back to you and you go… ‘that just happened’ and ‘did that just happen’. ‘Is that real’. I woke up wondering if it was just a bad dream and it wasn’t, was it?” Williamson was quoted as saying.

Who would have won WC final had both teams hit equal boundaries?
If England and New Zealand had hit equal boundaries both in Super Over and the match in World Cup final, a count-back from Super Over's final ball would've decided the winner. The team with the higher scoring delivery would've been declared the winner. England would've won as they hit a four on the last ball, while New Zealand scored one.

CricTracker
The 2019 World Cup final between England and New Zealand came to a rather dramatic end. The encounter at the iconic Lord’s Cricket Ground went down to the Super Over after both teams got tied on 241 runs. Even in the one-over eliminator, the Brits and the Kiwis notched 15 runs. Martin Guptill was run out in the last delivery of the over and the Three Lions won the championship.
It was also England’s maiden World Cup after they qualified for the finals for the first time since 1992 when Imran Khan’s Pakistan defeated them. Eoin Morgan and Co were declared the winners since they had hit more number of boundaries (50 overs plus Super Over). The decision to hand the trophy to England at the Home of Cricket triggered a massive outrage on social media because of the ‘boundary count’.

After the jaw-dropping encounter, Kane Williamson, the Black Caps’ skipper, said that his team didn’t lose the game and there was only one winner. Even as the ICC’s rules remain the same, the question is — what would have happened had the boundary count been the same for both teams?
Rule Number 1: If the number of boundaries in the above case is also equal, in that scenario, boundary scored in the 50 overs played by both teams (Super Over excluded) would have been counted.
Rule Number 2: In a rare scenario, even if after applying the above two scenarios, the count is still equal, in that case, a count-back would have been taken from the final balls faced by both teams in the Super Over and the side with the higher scoring delivery would have won.
For example, if both teams faced six balls in the Super Over, where one side scored four runs off the final ball and the other side scored six off their final delivery, the second side would have been the winner. Whichever was the last delivery faced by two teams in the Super Over (in case if a team lost 2 wickets and had faced just 4 balls in Super Over) would have been taken into account and the team that scored more runs off its final delivery would have lifted the trophy.

Stokes asked umpires to not award 4 overthrows in final, they ignored
England pacer James Anderson has revealed what all-rounder Ben Stokes requested umpires after the ball deflected off his bat and England got four overthrows in World Cup final's last over. "Stokes...said, 'Can you take that four runs off. We don't want it'," Anderson said. The umpires ignored the request because it was a four as per rules, Anderson added.

CricTracker
England won the World Cup for the first time on Sunday by defeating New Zealand on the basis of the boundary count. Many are criticising the ICC rules which decided the winner, the game had changed in the last over of the chase when the ball deflected off Ben Stokes’ bat to go for four overthrow runs. It led to the hosts coming back in the contest and having a realistic chance of winning the trophy. The game eventually ended in a tie and clearly, the overthrow runs helped England.
However, England’s Test pacer James Anderson has now revealed that Stokes had asked the umpire overturn the overthrow decision which would’ve cost them the World Cup. If at all, the on-field had obliged to Stokes’ request, the equation would’ve come down to seven runs off the last two balls.

The game-changing moment is being talked all over the world and Ben Stokes apologised to New Zealand skipper Kane Williamson soon after the incident. But the all-rounder’s gesture of asking to overturn the decision should win a lot of hearts.
“The etiquette in cricket is if the ball is thrown at the stumps and it hits you and goes into a gap in the field you don’t run. But if it goes to the boundary, in the rules it’s four and you can’t do anything about it. I think, talking to Michael Vaughan who saw him after the game, Ben Stokes actually went to the umpires and said, ‘Can you take that four runs off. We don’t want it’,” James Anderson said while speaking on the BBC’s Tailenders podcast.
Anderson also praised Stokes for having the presence of mind to ask the umpire not to add those four runs to England’s total. “But it’s in the rules and that’s the way it is. It’s been talked about for a while among the players, potentially that being a dead ball if it does hit the batsman and veer off somewhere.
“It was truly an incredible question to ask of the umpires, considering the gravity of the situation and the fact it would have left England struggling to force a tie after 50 overs of batting,” Anderson further added.

When the host asked if Jack, Leonardo's character, could have fit on the floating door in the scene towards the end of 'Titanic', Brad said, "You could've [squeezed in there], couldn't you?"

Leonardo DiCaprio's Once Upon a Time in Hollywood co-stars Brad Pitt and Margot Robbie amusingly weighed in on his Titanic raft controversy.
Fans have often debated whether the 44-year-old Oscar winner's character Jack could've fit on the floating wreckage, which spared the life of Kate Winslet's Rose from the 1997 hit film.
'Could you, could you have squeezed in there? You could've, couldn't you?' Pitt needled his grinning castmate during an MTV News interview posted Monday.

Margot admitted to 'bawling' her eyes out when she saw DiCaprio's tragic scene and agreed that it was the 'biggest controversy in modern cinema ever.'
'Did you mention it at the time?' the 29-year-old Oscar nominee asked Leo.
'Were you like, should we make the door smaller?'
At that, the former child star smiled coyly and repeated: 'Like I said, I have no comment.'

Titanic director James Cameron has argued that it's not a question of whether there was room for Jack, it's a question of buoyancy.
'When Jack puts Rose on the raft, then he tries to get on the raft - he's not an idiot, he doesn't want to die - and the raft sinks; and it kind of flips,' the 64-year-old Oscar winner told IGN back in 2012.
'So it's clear that there's really only enough buoyancy available for one person. So he makes the decision to let her be that person instead of taking them both down. If you know anything about hypothermia, the more you're submerged... and she's completely out of the water on the raft.
'It's only [a couple inches] above the surface. If he got on with her, they'd both be half in and half out of the water. Even if they could balance on it and they would've both died.'

Footage taken on a jungle safari in South Africa shows the exact moment a group of tourists had a lucky escape from a rampaging elephant.
The wild animal was filmed charging at tourists who were on board a Jeep and travelling through the region.  
Some of the people on board were believed to be Australian.
The vision showed the driver desperately attempting to reverse out of the elephant's path as it continued to charge toward them.
The tourists all remained calm throughout the ordeal, with some even choosing to film it.

Viewers on the Reddit thread where the video was shared commended the driver's ability to 'floor it in reverse and still not topple over'. 
Others noted it 'probably wasn't his first time in the situation'. 
Meanwhile, others said they must have been Australian because they all remained so calm. 
'You can tell they're Australian because of the accent but mainly because they're not screaming.
'Takes more than an elephant to get an Aussie sheila to scream.' 
Those at the back of the jeep continued to assist the driver by offering directions and describing what was in his path as he continued to drive backwards.
The vision cut off before the tourists were out of harm's way.

New Delhi (India), July 16 (ANI): In the backdrop of public hue and cry over the deaths of cows at a cow-shelter in Uttar Pradesh's Barabanki district, BJP MLA Ajay Singh on Tuesday said most of the deaths are from natural causes, adding that there is no laxity on the part of government to provide shelter and fodder to cattle. "Every animal has a life span. Human beings have a life span of 100 years while cattle's life is for 20 years. Even those cattle that are taken care of very well live for 12-13 years. There is much outcry but most of the cattle have died a natural death," he said.Singh also demanded accident services to be put in place for cattle."I had demanded from Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath that ambulance services should be started for animals similar as we have an ambulance for human beings. Animals are meeting accidents on road, on Highways," he said.Locals in Barabanki's Safdarganj on Monday alleged that some cows at a cow shelter died due to lack of fodder and water and poorly maintained the shelter. "We do not get proper fodder for cattle. No sufficient funds provided for the upkeep of the shelter. Around two to three cattle have died due to miserable conditions of shelter," a worker at the cow shelter had said.However, Barabanki District Magistrate denied allegations of lack of funds and fodder-water in the shelter. "The matter will be investigated and if found true then strict action would be taken. But as far as I know, there is no lack of fodder-water at any cow-shelter," he said.Last month, over a dozen cows allegedly starved to death in Jalalabad cow shelter of Uttar Pradesh's Kannauj district, triggering protests by locals outside a cow shelter.Following this,  Adityanath had held a meeting with the officials of Gau Seva Aayog and Animal Husbandry Department in Lok Bhavan to discuss the issue of stray cattle in the region.He had instructed the officials to ensure that all the cow-sheds are self-reliant in order to combat the menace.The Chief Minister had also announced that the government will give Rs 30 on a daily basis for each cattle for the fodder if the owners are not using them for commercial purpose. He instructed the officials to take this plan as a pilot project in the Bundelkhand region. (ANI)

Vistara flight makes emergency landing with just 10 mins of fuel left
A Mumbai-Delhi Vistara flight, with 153 passengers onboard, made an emergency landing in Lucknow after it had just 10 minutes of fuel left on Monday. The plane was supposed to land in Delhi around 5 pm but couldn't due to poor weather conditions. It landed in Lucknow around 6.30 pm after the pilot declared 'Mayday' over critical fuel levels.

India.com
New Delhi: A Vistara flight travelling from Mumbai to Delhi with 163 people on board made an emergency landing in Lucknow after it had just a few more minutes of fuel left.
Vistara’s Mumbai-Delhi UK 944 was hovering over Delhi for nearly 3-1/2 hours on Monday due to poor weather conditions following which it was diverted towards Lucknow. The aircraft also considered Kanpur and Allahabad (Prayagraj) as alternate airports.
However, the pilots declared ‘Mayday’ as the situation worsened with barely 10 minutes of fuel left. The air traffic controllers at Lucknow airport saved the day as flying to Prayagraj, the next nearest airport, would have taken at least 30 minutes more.
“The pilot who was operating UK944 flight and issued a ‘Mayday’ call on Monday has been grounded by the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA),” a source told news agency PTI.
On a normal occasion, an Airbus A-320 NEO which operated flight UK 944 has enough fuel for at least 60 extra minutes of flight that is used in such situations where the aircraft has to be diverted to alternate destinations.
A Vistara spokesperson stated, “The unexpected drop in visibility at the destination alternate was the main reason why the aircraft ended up in a low-fuel situation despite carrying excess fuel over and above the required Flight Plan Fuel as per regulations. Safety of passengers and crew was kept at the highest priority throughout the flight.”
The pilot flying the Vistara aircraft has been ‘de-rostered’ as per instructions of the regulator. (With PTI inputs)

Ex-South Africa footballer Marc Batchelor shot dead at 49
Former South Africa footballer Marc Batchelor was shot dead near his home in Johannesburg. "He was attacked by two men who were driving a motorbike," a police spokesman Col Lungelo Dlamini said. The 49-year-old, who played for South African teams Kaizer Chiefs, Orlando Pirates and Mamelodi Sundowns, was shot in his car.

Daily Mail
A former South African football star who was once threatened by Oscar Pistorius has been shot and killed outside his home in a suspected assassination. 
Mark Batchelor was gunned down by two men on motorbikes as he pulled into his driveway in Olivedale, Johannesburg, around 6pm on Monday.
Police say they have opened a murder investigation. Pictures being circulated on social media show the windscreen of Bachelor's car riddled with bullets.
Batchelor had previously claimed that Oscar Pistorious had threatened to break his legs in a row over a woman, and was present during his court case for shooting dead girlfriend Reeva Steencamp. 
Mark Bachelor was shot dead by two motorbike assassins as he pulled into his Johannesburg home around 6pm on Monday 
Mr Bachelor once accused Oscar Pistorius of threatening to 'break his legs' in a row over a woman (pictured, Mr Bachelor attends Pistorious's 2014 sentencing after he was convicted of shooting girlfriend Reeva Steencamp to death)
Pistorius threatened to break Mr Bachelor's legs because he believed the footballer was sleeping with his then-girlfriend Samantha Taylor (pictured together), it was claimed
Pictures being circulated on social media show the bullet-riddled windshield of Mr Batchelor's vehicle
South Africa has one of the highest rates of gun deaths in the world, with 23 people shot and killed per day on average.
Gun ownership is legal in South Africa, subject to background checks, a competency test, and a police licence.
However, rampant gang violence in cities such as Johannesburg coupled with up to 60,000 lost or stolen firearms, have combined to produce an epidemic of violence.
Many of these weapons and ammunition were stolen from security forces. 
Ineffective policing and corruption within forces is also a major contributing factor, according to a 2019 study.
The former Kaizer Chiefs and Orlando Pirates soccer player said Pistorius made his threat because he thought Mr Bachelor was sleeping with his then-girlfriend, Samantha Taylor.
Investigators say the motive for Monday shooting is not known, and they have not yet identified a suspect. 
Batchelor would regularly sit with Steenkamp's family during proceedings. 
Pistorius shot dead Reeva Steenkamp in the early hours of Valentine's Day in 2013 when he fired four times through the locked door of his bedroom toilet, later saying that he thought she was an intruder.
Former striker Mr Batchelor played for a number of clubs in South Africa , including Kaizer Chiefs and Orlando Pirates.
He is perhaps best remembered for being part of the Pirates team that won the African Champions League tournament in 1995.

The Trinamool Congress has written to Rajya Sabha Chairman Venkaiah Naidu and Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla, complaining against both Houses of Parliament allowing repeated questions on the law and order situation in West Bengal despite rules stating that members “shall not repeat in substance questions already answered”.
The letters were authored by Rajya Sabha MP Derek O’Brien and Lok Sabha MP Sudip Bandyopadhyay.

Bandyopadhyay cited Rule 41 (xiii) of the Rules of Procedure and Conduct of Business in the Lok Sabha, which says a member “shall not repeat in substance questions already answered’’. According to his letter to the Lok Sabha Speaker, three questions on political violence in Bengal during the 2019 general elections, have been allowed in the lower house.
Similarly, O’Brien referred to Rule 47 (xiv) of the Rules of Procedure and Conduct of Business in the Rajya Sabha, informing Chairman Venkaiah Naidu that four questions had been allowed on political violence in Bengal in the current session.
In their separate letters, the TMC leaders wrote, “This is butchering the parliamentary democratic process. Why is the Bengal government being targeted in such a manner? We strongly protest this and request you to kindly look into it.’’
O’Brien also pointed out that 10 advisories have been sent by the Centre to the West Bengal government in as short a span as ten days. Earlier in the day, TMC MP Sudip Bandyopadhyay had made the same statement in the Lok Sabha, claiming that the Bengal government was being unnecessarily harassed for political motives.

The New Zealand team ended up being the bridesmaids for the second time in a row when England defeated them thanks to a technicality in the final played at the Lord’s Cricket Ground. The Kane Williamson-led side was equal to England at all levels and the match ended in a tie with both teams on 241 runs and even the Super Over ended at levels with 15 runs each.
It can be said that luck was not with the Kiwis in the match as in the last few overs they managed to let a few things slip out of their hands. A turning point in the proceedings was Trent Boult taking Ben Stokes’ catch and then stepped onto the boundary ropes. Then the infamous four overthrows happened which was added to the two runs the batsmen completed and England got six runs off that ball. Though controversial, the runs stood and helped the hosts square the target.

In the Super Over, New Zealand was asked to chase down 15 runs and Jimmy Neesham made 13 of those, including a six off Jofra Archer. With two needed off the last ball, Martin Guptill was run out attempting the second and England won the encounter as they had hit more boundaries than their opponents and became World Champions.
Neesham was gutted and consoled Guptill, whose throw had hit Stokes’ bat and went for four runs turning the game on its head and couldn’t seal the deal when it mattered the most. He went on Twitter after the game and put a message on that kids shouldn’t take up sports due to the heartbreak and advised them to take up bakery and life their life happily.
Neesham tweeted, “Kids, don’t take up sport. Take up baking or something. Die at 60 really fat and happy.”

However, one celebrity from the field of movies and entertainment, who was once known for his enormous girth disagreed with Neesham’s advise. Adnan Sami, the famous singer replied to the cricketer saying that he should be proud of the way he and his team played. He also said that being fat doesn’t necessary means happiness.
Sami, who became famous due to his amazing voice and for being on the heavier side on the weighing scale; made a complete transformation a few years ago and even got Indian citizenship, leaving behind his home country of Pakistan.
Sami tweeted, “Hey chin-up mate! You guys were brilliant. Besides, fatness doesn’t necessarily lead to happiness. You all taught the world the most important lesson of how to fight. Much love!”

Jofra Archer's old tweets resurface, users connect it with WC final
England fast bowler Jofra Archer's old tweets went viral, with fans connecting them to the 2019 World Cup final. Users related his 2013 tweet reading, "16 from 6" with the target set for New Zealand by England in the Super Over. Users also shared his 2015 tweet reading "What stupid rule is this," after the final ended on boundary count.

England won the World Cup for the first time in their history after a cliffhanger of a final which went into the super over. Jofra Archer who only became eligible to play for them just before the mega event was at the centre stage again as he was handed the ball to deliver the super over. It looked all destined for the Caribbean born cricketer who made the cut at the last moment and here he was, delivering for his team to win the World Cup. He did it successfully, in the end, to etch his name in history.
It was a memorable World Cup for Archer. He was always the lead bowler for England and ended up picking 20 wickets in 11 matches. Whenever they needed a wicket, Eoin Morgan looked at him and Archer didn’t disappoint. The same happened on Sunday as well and the 24-year-old obliged helping England win the title. However, more than his performance, his tweets were going viral throughout the tournament.

After having tweeted earlier about the semi-final clash between England and Australia, Jofra Archer once again proved that he is from the future with his hilarious tweets about the final.
With England needing 15 from the last over and after all the drama unfolded, the equation had come down to 2 runs off the last ball. At the same time, Jofra Archer’s tweet reading, “Wouldn’t mind the super over,” went viral and as the destiny had it, the man himself was at the helm to defend 16 runs later.
Interestingly, New Zealand needed 16 off 6 deliveries in the super over and the pacer had a similar tweet on his timeline which is seriously crazy. A lot of such tweets related to certain matches have been already tweeted by him and this World Cup was a testimony to it.
Having said that, Jofra Archer delivered when it mattered the most for his team and has the World Cup trophy to his name today. He has a long way to go in his career and it should be no surprise if he is picked in the England squad for the Ashes which is set to begin from August 1.

Madras Christian College prof sacked for sexually harassing students
Madras Christian College in Chennai has sacked Zoology professor R Raveen after an internal inquiry found him guilty of sexually harassing female students. Several students had complained that Raveen made lewd remarks about their clothes, harassed them and behaved inappropriately during a department trip earlier this year. Another faculty Samuel Tennyson was accused of abetting Raveen's behaviour.

The News Minute
The Madras Christian College in Chennai has sacked a professor from the department of Zoology after he was found guilty of sexually harassing the female students of the department during a college tour. R Raveen, who was an assistant professor in the Zoology department was dismissed after a detailed inquiry by the college Internal Complaints Committee into the incident. 
His colleague Samuel Tennyson, another faculty from the department, too had been accused of abetting Raveen's behaviour. However, the college is yet to dismiss Samuel due to a case filed by him on the issue in the Madras High Court. 
MCC's principal Alexander Jesudasan confirmed the dismissal. "We have dismissed the professor after the ICC found him guilty of multiple cases of sexual harassment against students of the department. As for Samuel, the college cannot issue a dismissal order as there is a court case pending on the issue. However, the court has directed Samuel not to enter the campus premises," the principal said. 
A student from the Zoology department also added that the dismissed professor had not visited the college for over three weeks. "Ever since college re-opened in June, he has not been coming to college. I had enquired with the other staff of the department and they also said that his attendance book showed that he was 'officially dismissed as per government norms',” the student added. 

In February this year, the dismissed professor along with Samuel Tennyson had taken a group of 50 students to Karnataka as part of a college excursion. During the trip, several girl students complained that the professor in question made lewd remarks about their clothes, harassed them and behaved inappropriately. They also alleged that throughout the trip, Tennyson had abetted Raveen’s behaviour by encouraging him. 
On returning to Chennai, the students complained to the Head of the Department who dismissed their complaints, calling it a 'first time offence' by the said teacher. Later, a petition signed by 30 odd students of the department protesting the college's lack of initiative in addressing the issue caught the attention of the authorities. 
An ICC inquiry was held on the issue, and statements of the students who were subjected to harassment and the accused professors were recorded. On May 24, the ICC released the results of the inquiry which found both the professors guilty. 
"We have not not received any official intimation by the college authorities regarding the professor's dismissal. However, we heard from teachers of the department that action has been taken. Further, the headmaster even confirmed this to the media," the student added.

US Air Force warns as 13L volunteer to storm Area 51 'to see aliens'
The US Air Force has warned that it's "ready to protect America and its assets" after 13 lakh people signed up for a Facebook event to "storm" Area 51 to "see aliens". "[Area 51] is an open training range...we'd discourage anyone from trying to come into the area where we train armed forces," a US Air Force spokesperson said.
https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-7248769/US-Air-Force-ready-protect-America-assets-one-million-join-Area-51-Facebook-event.html?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts
Daily Mail
The US Air Force has warned it is 'ready to defend America and its assets' after more than a million people joined an event to 'storm Area 51'.
The 'Storm Area 51, They Can't Stop All of Us' Facebook event is scheduled to take place on September 20 and has attracted millions of alien conspiracy theorists.
The organisers said: 'We can move faster than their bullets. Let's see them aliens.' 
It's likely few, if any, are actually serious about attending but the US Air Force has still issued a stern statement about the satirical event. 
Air Force spokesperson Laura McAndrews said: '[Area 51] is an open training range for the US Air Force, and we would discourage anyone from trying to come into the area where we train American armed forces.
'The US Air Force always stands ready to protect America and its assets.'
More than a million alien hunters are gearing up to storm Area 51, America's most secretive and secure military base shrouded in extraterrestrial conspiracy theories (file photo)
Fanatics took to social media to share their excitement at the event, with many posting memes and gifs of their hopeful alien interactions.
'We will all meet up at the Area 51 Alien Center tourist attraction and coordinate our entry,' the event description says. 
'If we Naruto run, we can move faster than their bullets. Lets [sic] see them [sic] aliens.'
The phrase 'Naruto run' refers to anime character Naruto Uzumaki, who is known for a running style that has his body tilted forward and low to the ground while his arms are stretched out behind his back. 
The Area 51 Alien Center is a truck stop on Interstate 95, about an hour's drive from the Nevada Test and Training Range - which contains Area 51.
The last known person who went hunting for aliens at Area 51 was shot dead by guards back in January. 
More than a million people have RSVPd that they are 'going' to the event. One attendee posted a map explaining how the group would approach the highly-secure base
The Facebook event is hosted by a 'religious organization' called 'S***posting because I'm in shambles' and a gaming page called 'SmyleeKun'.  'We will all meet up at the Area 51 Alien Center tourist attraction and coordinate our entry,' the event description says
'Area 51' is the codename for the highly-classified remote detachment of California's Edwards Air Base, located 83 miles northwest of Las Vegas. 
It was founded in 1955 as a test site for the Lockheed U-2 reconnaissance plane.  

Since then, however, it has become the subject of numerous UFO sightings and has become inextricably linked in the public's mind with captive aliens and government conspiracies.  
Famous machines developed there include the U-2 spy plane, SR-71 Blackbird, and the F-117A Nighthawk stealth fighter. 
Many conspiracy theorists claim the base has been used to research an alleged crashed alien spacecraft at Roswell, New Mexico, in 1947.
The base was erected in a remote part of the Nevada desert to avoid prying eyes 
What takes place inside the heavy-duty fence at Area 51 has remained a mystery to anyone without high-level security clearance, save for a few photos taken illegally by curious conspiracy theorists.
In 2013 the US government admitted that the base is a secret intelligence hub when the CIA released an official history of the U-2 and OXCART projects, along with aerial photos of the site.
NTTR experienced a rare security breach in January when an unidentified male sped through a checkpoint at the entrance. 
Guards and Nye County police chased him at high-speed for about eight miles before he came to a stop and exited his vehicle. 
He began advancing toward officers with an 'unknown cylindrical object' in hand and did not heed verbal warnings to stop, so security officials were forced to open fire. 
He was pronounced dead at the scene.

As many as 30 of the state's 33 districts are submerged in floodwater and over 52 lakh people have been affected. The state has set up 695 relief camps where nearly 1.5 lakh people have sought shelter.

The situation in Assam deteriorated further on Tuesday 17 July, as floodwaters submerged 32 of the 33 districts in Assam and the death toll increased to 27.
In light of the situation, the Centre has released Rs 251.55 crore grants-in-aid to the State Disaster Response Fund (SDRF) for 2019-20. Meanwhile, the Northeast Frontier Railway as decided to add additional coaches in some trains connecting important cities of lower & upper Assam, for passengers stranded due to floods in Assam.
Altogether 57 lakh people in 4,620 villages are reeling under the impact of the floods that have submerged over 1,53,211 hectares of farm land in 33 districts, Assam State Disaster Management Authority (ASDMA) told PTI.
Two people were killed in a landslide in Kamrup and Dima Hasao district, taking the toll to 17 so far, it said.
The ASDMA report said embankments, roads, bridges, culverts and many other infrastructure have been damaged at various places in Sonitpur, Golaghat, Jorhat, Baksa, Dibrugarh, Nalbari, Hojai, Morigaon, Lakhimpur, Darrang, Nagaon, Kamrup, Barpeta, Dhubri, Majuli, Karimganj, Sivasagar, Hailakandi and South Salmara districts, officials said.
Massive erosion has been witnessed in Udalguri, Barpeta and Sonitpur districts.
Around 15 teams of the NDRF with 38 deep divers, 48 IRB boats and other life-saving aids, have been deployed to tackle the flood situation in Assam.
Meanwhile, flood waters have submerged major portions of Kaziranga, Pobitora and Manas rhino habitats, forcing the animals to take shelter in the artificial highlands for safety.
A release by the Assam Ministry of Forest and Environment on Monday said about 90 percent of Kaziranaga National Park is presently inundated.
Though 155 of the 199 anti-poaching camps of the park are affected by flood waters, the staff and security personnel are discharging their duty using mechanised and country boats, it said.
A special rhino protection force has also been deployed in vulnerable locations of the park.
Around 70 percent of the 46 sq km area at Pobitora Wildlife Sanctuary in Morigaon district has also been inundated, forcing one-horned rhinos to venture into the nearby highlands, a forest official told PTI on Monday, 15 July.
The sanctuary near Guwahati has the highest density of Indian one-horned rhinos in the world at over 100.
Home Minister Amit Shah on Saturday, 13 July, chaired a high-level meeting on Saturday to review the current flood situation in different parts of the country and the preparedness of the States and Central Ministries and agencies concerned to deal with the situation.
Shah directed the National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) and all agencies dealing with flood rescue and relief operations in Assam to remain on high alert so that they can handle any situation arising out of the natural calamity.
Assam Chief Minister Sarbananda Sonowal said Shah has also assured all possible help from the Centre to tackle the floods.
Brahmaputra has been rising menacingly above the danger level across the state, swelling up in Guwahati and overflowing its bank in the Uzan Bazar area, PTI quoted officials as saying on Monday, 15 July.
Sonowal visited flood-hit Nalbari district and the Solmara flood relief camp on Monday.
Even as the NDRF and the SDRF continued their rescue operations, the Baksa district administration sought the Army's help to evacuate stranded people in Balipur Char village, inundated by the Beki river.
The army also rescued at least 160 people during a night operation on Monday in Assam’s Nalbari district, ANI reported.
An NDRF release said the force rescued more than 2,500 people from flood-affected areas in Baksa, Morigaon, Golaghat, Barpeta and Kamrup districts since 11 July.
The swirling flood waters have forced the railway authority to control train services due to “settlement of tracks” in Lumding-Badarpur hill section, Northeast Frontier Railway Chief Public Relations Officer Pranav Jyoti Sharma said.
Heavy rains have affected the train tracks between Jatinga Lumpur to New Harangajao station in Lumding-Badarpur hill section of the NF Railway, he added.
As a result, some trains have either been cancelled or short terminated, Sharma said.

Daily Mail
Instagram is under fire for allowing a disturbing photo of a slain 17-year-old social media star to stay up for nearly a day after it was posted by a man she was seeing, 21, who is accused of slitting her throat after she had traveled hours to see him. 
The image of Bianca Devins' body was shared by Brandon Andrew Clark, 21, of Cicero in upstate New York, with the caption 'I'm sorry Bianca' at around 6.40am on Sunday. He uploaded it to his Instagram story and also posted it on Discord, a server where computer game enthusiasts chat. 
Bianca and Brandon had been seeing each other for around two months after meeting online and she had gone to meet see him on Saturday. Her family have called him a 'family friend' who they trusted. 
According to a friend of the pair's, they had been at a concert and had gone home where he got angry and stabbed her because he was jealous she had flirted with another man.  
After allegedly killing her in their SUV, Brandon called 911 and threatened to harm himself. When police arrived at his home, he started stabbing himself in the neck in a suicide attempt. 
He was taken to the hospital, Bianca's body was discovered and has now been charged with her murder. 
But more than 12 hours after police found her body, Clark's Instagram story remained active. 
There was a filter on it which warned viewers that it was sensitive content but it was easily bypassed by a simple touch of the screen.  
Only after other users complained was it removed and it had been screen-shotted and shared by scores of users by then. It took even longer for Instagram to disable Clarks' account.  
Brandon Andrew Clark, 21, of Cicero, is accused of killing 17-year-old Bianca Devins, pictured, before inflicting severe injuries to himself in upstate New York. After allegedly slitting her throat, Clark posted a photo of her body on his Instagram story 
Now, the company is under fire for not acting quickly enough. 
It has not addressed the delay but told DailyMail.com on Tuesday: 'We removed this image, and subsequently the account, for violating our policies. 
'To stop the content from spreading, we have technology that allows us to proactively find other attempts to upload the image in question, and automatically remove these posts before anyone sees them. 
'We are also reviewing hashtags and accounts claiming to share this content and taking action in line with our policies.' 
Bianca's family have slammed it as 'disgusting' that people took photos of her body. 
They are begging people to stop sharing them online and have asked instead that they remember her in a positive way. 
'It is absolutely disgusting that people are sharing, screen-shotting the pictures of Bianca’s tragic death!
'I have seen the pictures. I will FOREVER have those images in my mind when I think of her. 
Before he called 911 himself, Clark posted this image of a road from inside an SUV on his Instagram story. He and Bianca had been at a concert in Queens and were driving back to Utica on Saturday night. He slit her throat then tried to kill himself hours afterwards 
Clark scrawled 'may you never forget me' next to his a tarp covering his girlfriend and took selfies of himself with her as police surrounded him 
'When I close my eyes, those images haunt me,' her mother, Kaleigh Nicole, said on Facebook on Monday night.
Nicole Dollenganger, the singer whose concert the pair had gone to earlier, also made a plea with fans to stop posting the photographs. 
'What happened to this beautiful angel was evil, cruel and senseless.
Clark had met Bianca online and the pair were seeing each other for two months before her death. After stabbing her in the neck, he called 911 and told police where they were. When officers arrived, he started stabbing himself in the neck, started filming it on Instagram stories and also posed for a selfie with her corpse which, by then, he had moved beneath a green tarp, according to police. He remains in the hospital 
'I am so heartbroken for her and all her loved ones.
'While I know some of u are very well-intentioned, I ask that U PLEASE STOP sharing the horrific content her murderer distributed.
'PLEASE stop sending them to me,' she wrote. 
The family arranged candlelit vigils for her on Sunday. 
They are also working to stamp out a fake GoFundMe account which is circulating online, asking for donations, which they said they had nothing to do with. 
Instagram declined to say what time the image of Devins' body was removed. 
Devins amassed thousands of followers on Instagram on two different accounts. 
Since her death, chat rooms and internet forums where people claim to have known her have been abuzz with rumor and discussion about her and Clark and how they met. 
They say he 'stalked' her and was obsessed with her profiles. According to Rolling Stone, after killing her, Clark posted on Discord: 'Sorry f*****s, you’re gonna have to find someone else to orbit.'
Orbit is an internet slang term for stalking a woman's social media profile in the hope that she will have sex with you. 
On Saturday, they had gone to a Nicole Dollenganger concert then driven back to Utica at around 10pm. Clark was the driver.  
 
 





 
Instagram came under fire for not doing more to stop the spread of the photos on Sunday and Monday
There was another man with them at the concert but he did not return with them. Instead, the three smoked marijuana at the concert, according to a woman who called herself Chels.
That is when, she said, Clark accused Devins of flirting with the other man and attacked her. 
He then took to Discord and posted a photo of a road on his Instagram story with the caption: 'Here comes hell. It’s redemption, right?' 
After photos of her body emerged online, numerous people called 911 to report it. Police were already trying to find the pair when he called himself.  
After news broke on social media of Devins' killing, users flooded both Clark and Devins' profiles with horrific comments about her death. 
They used the hashtag '#RIPBianca' and re-posted the gruesome image.   
Internet star Bianca struck up a relationship with Clark when the pair met on the internet, over two months ago. 
Bianca was known online as an 'e-girl' and had built up a large following on her two Instagram accounts, @escty and @beegtfo. 
She also frequented gaming website Discord and image board 4chan.
The pair initially communicated over Instagram before meeting in person and developing a more intimate relationship and becoming acquainted with each others families.  
Brandon Andrew Clark known as @yesjuliet on Instagram had his page disabled 
Bianca is shown with her sister, Liv, and her mother, Kim, in an image posted by the family after her deth 
Police arrived at the scene on Sunday morning to find Clark lying on the ground beside a black SUV. 
When the officer approached, he began to stab himself in the neck with a knife. 
The officer requested emergency medical care as Clark then laid himself across a green tarp that was on the ground. 
Bianca's family said she was a recent graduate who had overcome mental health issues
When asked about where the female was located, Clark told the officer that she was beneath the tarp. 
Clark then pulled out a cell phone and took photos of himself laying across the deceased female.
Utica police told BuzzFeed News Clark kept posting to Instagram story while he was being held at gunpoint by officers.   
In a statement released on Monday, Devins' family described her as a talented artist and wonderful young girl who was excited about starting college. 
'She is now looking down on us, as she joins her cat, Belle, in heaven,' the statement reads. 
'Bianca's smile brightened our lives. She will always be remembered as our Princess.
'Your prayers help to strengthen us through this difficult time.' 
The blogger's sister Liv paid tribute to her sister, writing: 'I hate that I have to write this. I hate knowing you're not going to ever come back home. 
'You were the best sister anyone could've ever asked for. Thank you for always being there for me. Thank you for being the best sister I could ever imagine.
'Thank you for always protecting me and sticking up for me.
'I am going to do this for you. Every day I'm going to do my best and I'm going to get through this thing called life and do it all for you.
'Rest easy, I love you so much forever and always.'

England pacer Dernbach retires on day of England's World Cup win
England's 33-year-old pacer Jade Dernbach, who last played an international match in 2014, announced his retirement from international cricket on the day England won 2019 World Cup. The Surrey cricketer said, "I think this is a good time...The team are in a good place moving forward." Dernbach, who made his international debut in 2011, represented England 58 times.

England made history on Sunday at the iconic Lord’s Cricket Ground by bagging their first-ever Men’s World Cup title. It was a long wait for the creators of the game for they had to return empty-handed from the final three times in the past. They then failed to make the semi-finals for 27 long years and when England did again, they ended up as the champions although their Super Over win over New Zealand didn’t look convincing to many.
However, the England fans were ecstatic to see their country eventually win a world title and one player even called it a day on the historic occasion to make his exit from the cricketing world a memorable one. It was Jade Dernbach, a right-arm medium pacer who hadn’t played much for England (24 ODIs and 34 T20Is) but decided to bask in the glory of the Englishmen conquering the cricketing world.

The Surrey cricketer, who is known for his wild celebrations after taking wickets, had last played for England in 2014 and has 70 wickets in international cricket (31 in ODIs and 39 in T20Is) with a couple of four-fors. The 33-year-old cricketer, however, will continue to play for Surrey and will guide youngsters in the club as a senior member. Dernbach, like many other cricketers of foreign origin who had played for England, was born in Johannesburg, South Africa, and moved to England as a 14-year-old.
He made his debut for Surrey against India A at the age of 17 and in 2006, he became the club’s leading wicket-taker and came up with a superlative performance at the Natwest Pro40.
He wrote- “I think this is a good time to announce that after a lot of consideration today I am announcing my international retirement. Thank you for all the support over the years but the team are in a good place moving forward. Looking forward to concentrating on Surrey now.”

In 113 first-class and 144 List A games, Dernbach, popularly called ‘Dirtbag’, has over 530 wickets with 13 five-wicket hauls in all. He got the England Cricket Board’s increment contract in 2011-12 but proved to be an expensive bowler in the ODI series against India. His performance improved in the later stages and he played the shorter formats for England between 2011 and 2014.
Dernbach thanked the supporters for standing by him and said he will continue to serve Surrey.

AI algorithm can solve Rubik's cube in about 1 second
California University researchers have created an AI algorithm that can solve a Rubik's cube in a "fraction of a second", the human record for which stands at 3.47 seconds. DeepCubeA algorithm solved 100% of all test configurations, finding shortest path about 60% of the time. DeepCubeA, however, is three times slower than MIT's non-AI 'min2phase' algorithm, the current fastest.

In an incident of suspected human sacrifice and black magic, three people were found dead with slit throats in the premises of an under-construction temple in a village in Andhra Pradesh's Anantapuramu. Moreover, blood was found splattered over the Shivling inside the temple. The deceased have been identified as the temple caretaker, his sister and a woman from the village.

The News Minute
In an incident of suspected human sacrifice and black magic, three people were found dead in the premises of a temple in Korthikota of Tanakal in Anantapur district of Andhra Pradesh. The three people – Shivarami Reddy who was looking after the temple, his sister Kamalamma, and another woman from the same village, Sathyalakshmi – were found with their throats slit in the under construction temple. 
On Monday morning, the local police found three dead bodies in the Shivalayam which is under construction, as the old temple in the village was demolished sometime back. 
Of the three victims, two were found lying on a cot, and on the ground, in a pool of blood. A  devotee who came to the temple in the morning found the dead bodies and informed the police. 
While the dead bodies were found right outside the temple, their blood was splattered over the Shivalingam inside the temple. 

Speaking to TNM, Kadiri Rural Circle Inspector Madhu said they’re also investigating whether the crime scene was arranged in such a way to throw off the probe. “We suspect that someone deliberately tried to influence the investigation by doing some suspicious things after the murders,” he said. 
Police suspect the three people were killed with sharp objects. A murder case has been registered and investigation is underway.
Kadiri DySP Srinivasulu said, “Unidentified persons have killed Shivarami Reddy by causing heavy injuries on his head, as per preliminary investigation. We have roped in the dog squad and clues teams, we will use all the clues to investigate the case from all possible angles."
An investigating officer also told TNM that they're looking into a “treasure hunt” angle given the abnormality of the crime scene.
In a similar case, a headless body was found in Nallamala forests of Kurnool district earlier this week raising suspicions about human sacrifice.

Delhi govt built 23 flyovers in last 4.5 years: CM Kejriwal
After inaugurating the Rao Tula Ram (RTR) flyover, Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal on Tuesday claimed that his government has built 23 flyovers in the last 4.5 years. Kejriwal added, "We believe in doing our work and not indulging in dirty politics." He said that a few more such projects will be coming up before the end of his government's tenure.

India.com
After inaugurating the 2.85 km signal-free new RTR Flyover on Tuesday, Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal, while interacting with reporters, said that his government has built 23 flyovers in the last four-and-a-half years and that many more such projects will be coming up in the national capital before the end of his government’s tenure.
The Rao Tula Ram Flyover, which was built at a cost of Rs 205 crore, is located on the Outer Ring Road and it branches out from the Munirka Flyover and ends before the Army Research and Referral Hospital near Subroto Park which is close to National Highway-8.
“In 15 years, the Sheila Dikshit government built 70 flyovers. In the last four-and-a-half years, our (AAP) government has built 23 flyovers. We do our work, but we don’t advertise much. Now, it is for the people to spread the word about the work we have done in the last four-and-a-half years,” Kejriwal said in his address after inaugurating the flyover.
Asked if more projects were in the offing before the end of his government’s tenure, Kejriwal said, “Yes, a few more such projects will come up soon.”
Work on the newly-built elevated corridor, which will help decongest the area and prove a boon for people commuting towards the IGI airport from south Delhi and Noida, started in November 2014 and it was supposed to be completed by November 2016 but it missed several deadlines.
Hitting out at his detractors, the AAP chief said after the inauguration of the Signature Bridge, a member of the opposition party had sought to take credit for the project.
“We believe in doing our work and not indulging in dirty politics. The Delhi government has worked a lot in education, health and other sectors, and our work will speak,” he said.
In his interaction with reporters after the event, Kejriwal also said that the AAP government not only worked on mega infrastructure projects but also built roads, sewage lines and provided other facilities in unauthorised colonies to reach out to the ordinary people.

Can't tell Speaker how to decide on resignation of MLAs: SC
The Supreme Court on Tuesday said that it cannot say how the Speaker should decide on the resignations or disqualification of the rebel Karnataka MLAs. "We cannot fetter him. The question here is if there is any constitutional obligation for him to decide resignation before disqualification or to club his decision on both," CJI Ranjan Gogoi said.

New Delhi: Hearing Karnataka rebel MLAs case, the Supreme Court on Tuesday said it could not say if the Speaker should decide on the resignations or the disqualification first. (Also read: ‘Cong MLAs Fought Like Tigers,’ Says DK Shivakumar)
It said, “We cannot fetter him.”  CJI Ranjan Gogoi said, “The question is if there is any constitutional obligation for him to decide resignation before disqualification or to club his decision on both”.
The apex court bench of the CJI and Justice Deepak Gupta is dealing with the plea of rebel MLAs who have sought that Karnataka Assembly speaker KR Ramesh Kumar should accept their resignations.
In their application before the bench, the MLAs on Monday sought an impleadment as parties to the pending plea on which it was ordered that the Speaker would not take any decision till Tuesday on the resignations and disqualifications.
On July 12, the apex court had asked the Speaker to maintain status quo. Abhishek Singhvi pleaded with the apex court to vacate the status quo order on MLAs’ resignation saying speaker will complete all the process by Wednesday.
What triggered the plea is a legislative loophole, say reports. Ministers can contest the by-polls and get re-elected in the current House if they resign. But if they are disqualified, they will be barred from contesting for a seat in the current Assembly.
Mukul Rohatgi, appearing for the rebel MLAs, has sought for the Speaker’s decision within a timeframe.

Farmer held for killing scientist whose body was found in Nazi bunker
A local farmer has been arrested on suspicion of murdering American scientist Suzanne Eaton on the Greek island of Crete. The 27-year-old has reportedly confessed to the murder, with the police saying sexual abuse was a likely motive. The body of Eaton, a molecular biologist, was found by the Greek authorities inside a bunker used by the Nazis during WWII.

Suzanne Eaton (pictured) body was found deep at the bottom of a cave
A man has been arrested for the murder of American biologist Suzanne Eaton. 
He is a 27-year-old father of two, DailyMail.com can reveal.
Police sources said he was arrested over the weekend and has reportedly confessed to killing Dr Eaton. 
Detective believed that only a local person would have known the locality of the hidden cave, which was a former Nazi bunker. 
The detained man is believed to come from Maleme, which is a only a few miles from the hidden 200-feet long cave’s location. 
Sources said police believed the suspect, a local farmer, had a sexual motive.
Dr Eaton was attacked as she walked back to the convention center she had been staying at.
‘He hit her with his car to stop her from running and then stabbed her’ said the source.
Police found him by tracing his cell phone to the area and found his car tracks near the cave.  
Dr Eaton's body landed face down, around 200 feet inside the labyrinth of passages that pass through this cave (pictured)
Local villagers said they believed only somebody from the area would have known about the cave, which is off a dust track and then involves a trek through rugged woodland and is not visible easily to the naked eye or from the road
Police believe she was picked up from the road outside the fishing village of Afrata and suffocated, before being dumped through a shaft into the cave
Dr. Eaton's body was found deep at the bottom of a cave which was used by Nazis to store ammunition during the second World War.
Crete has groups of Nazi fanatics and supporters who trade in memorabilia and souvenirs left behind by soldiers.
Police believe the location of the caves would only have been known to a few around there and particularly those with an interest in Nazi background.   
It comes as Dr Eaton's family pay heartfelt tributes to her.
Her mother, son Max, brother Rob and her sister have broken their silence to remember the 59-year-old scientist who was suffocated and stabbed after going out walking. 
Her mother Glynda said: ‘She was a devoted wife and mother, and dearly loved by her family. 
‘From the day Suzanne was brought to me right after she was born - stuffed into a red Christmas stocking, December 23 - not drowsy and sleepy but with her head up, her eyes alert, that interest in everything around her has never changed.
‘It has been a joy to share her love of books and music, to observe the combination of a certain flamboyancy with a calm, thoughtful, steady personality.
‘Her accomplishments are many and varied: avid gardener, accomplished pianist, black belt in Taekwondo, and of course her contributions to developmental biology.’
Dr Eaton left the Orthodox academy for a run and was discovered in a World War II cave near the settlement of Xamoudochori on Monday nigh
One of her two sons Max added that he would always ‘cherish’ her memory.
He added: ‘My mother was a remarkable woman.
‘She managed to live a life with few regrets, balancing out her personal life with her career.
‘I think the fact that I did not realize how well she had managed to do so was evident that other mothers around me had taken to caring for their children full time, yet mine was never outdone by any of them.
‘Supportive and encouraging, she nurtured and supported anything that the distractible mind of my childhood would come up with, and this curiosity has stuck with me to this day.
‘As I grew, her brilliance as a scientist began to dawn on me. Always armed with a question, she would show interest in any topic broached.
‘Many a time I discussed topics with her that I had studied at university, and within a week, she would be as well versed in that topic as any of my professors.
‘Yet she was far more than a scientist. Her love for music shone brightly, her eyes lit up every time she talked about a piece she was playing, and she would laugh with me in admiration of the sheer complexity of a piano arrangement.
‘I have many fond memories of her and my father playing duets together, filling our home with a beautiful, joyful sound that was unique to them, and I shall forever cherish the memory of lying on the floor, watching and listening to the thing that brought them together.’
Dr Eaton’s younger sister, in a written tribute, said: ‘Sue is too great a person for her legacy to be defined in any way by how we lost her.
‘I can’t help but think that if Suzanne were here, she would know how to write this statement.
‘She was good with words and it didn’t matter if it was a personal expression of grief or joy or a scientific paper on endocannabinoids.
‘She took great pleasure in preparing exquisite meals and had an exotic fashion sense.
‘She loved perfume. She taught and practiced Taekwondo as a second degree black belt. She finished crossword puzzles way too quickly, played concertos, and read extensively.
‘She fitted Jane Austin’s strictest description of an "accomplished woman" while maintaining a natural humility and "insatiable curiosity".
‘She worried that it was impossible to give both her science and her family her all. But anyone who read of her accomplishments in the field of molecular and developmental biology, or who witnessed her joy in tutoring, comforting, and inspiring her children, or sharing with, and loving her husband, would not have suspected.
‘With a deep sensitivity and compassion, she somehow made us all a priority.
‘We are immensely proud of her. It was her words that finally helped me deal with death, and she was in the process of teaching me how to live. So, I will continue on that journey.
‘I have made a conscious decision not to allow those facts to haunt my memory. My memory will be one of pure joy and gratitude, of love and admiration for an arm in arm sister, a closest confidant, a strong, kind, brilliant, selfless human being who made indelible contributions to science and added immeasurable beauty to our lives.
Her brother Rib said: ‘I have lost a sister. The world has lost more than it will ever know. Suzanne brought a new perspective to everything.
‘As a scientist she would pull together the threads of common knowledge from other disciplines to create profound new understandings in her own. As a chef she could make the most exotic dish seem simple and homey.
'I will miss our animated conversations. I would always walk away with a head full of new ideas and enthusiasm. Most of all I will miss the kindest, wisest person I will probably ever know.’  
An 85-year-old gardener and an elderly fisherman have both independently told detectives they saw Dr Eaton in the village of Afrata, which is three miles from the place she had been staying.
Officers now believe Dr Eaton disappeared a mile outside of Afrata as she made her way back to the Orthodox Academy of Crete where she was due to be a keynote conference speaker. 
Police have questioned several people and detained possible suspects, believing they are close to finding Dr Eaton's killer, DailyMail.com can reveal 
She had fought for her life against an attacker armed with a knife, and suffered substantial knife wounds to her body, police sources told ABC. 
The witnesses are adamant she came into the picturesque former fishing village, which does not have street surveillance cameras and is surrounded by cliffs and olive fields, before turning back towards the academy.
The retired gardener, who asked not to be identified, told DailyMail.com: 'I saw her and I recognized her from the photographs of her. I also told police correctly the pink and purple colors of her clothing.
'She was walking quite fast near a bridge and small church on the road out of the village. I was walking and she walked past me. I am sad about what has happened to her.'
It is believed she met her killer or killers on the road out of Afrata and may have become exhausted in the 90-degree heat and through having walked four miles.
She had walked north out of the academy and her body was found about six miles away south of the academy in a cave which had been a Nazi bunker during the Second World War.
It is thought she was picked up from the road outside Afrata and suffocated and stabbed, before being dumped through a shaft into the cave at Xamoudochori. 
Her body had still not been released to her British husband and forensic tests are being conducted to see if she had been raped.
Coroner Antonis Papadomanolakis told local news outlets: 'Her death was not immediate. It is not like in a shooting. There was duration involved.'
One of the last people to see her alive, Katerina Karkala-Zormpa of the Orthodox Academy of Crete, told DailyMail.com: 'She was in a good mood and laughing as she came through the reception.
'She played the piano and then went out. She always felt safe here and it was her fourth visit.
'She felt so comfortable here, she left her room unlocked with the key inside and her belongings.'
'It was a great shock when we heard that she was missing. She used to take walks whenever she was here and I could not believe she had got lost,' Karkala-Zormpa said. 'Her family came here and worked so hard to find her. They were always sending emails and on the telephone and helping the search.
Her body had still not been released to her British husband Tony Hyman (pictured) and forensic tests are being conducted to see if she had been raped 
'It was so sad when her body was discovered but in some way it was a relief because at least they knew what had happened. Of course they wanted to find her alive, but after a week they just needed to know.'
'After she had died, we found out what a brilliant scientist she was and the incredible research she had done. She was very modest and did not make a big deal about her achievements,' she added. 'The whole matter had been very difficult and we hope the killer or killers are found as soon as possible.'
She said Dr Eaton was an experienced and fit hiker and would not normally have accepted a ride from strangers.
Police are also talking to cell phone companies on Crete that the murderer or murderers possibly had on them when they suffocated and stabbed her before dumping her body.
Authorities are trying to establish whether a phone signal was picked up by cell phone masts close to the remote olive fields where her body was found.
Crucially, they have pin-pointed a two-hour period on the night of Tuesday, July 2 when several phone signals were picked up in an area which they believe would have been known to them and few from outside the area.
DailyMail.com previously revealed that officers, in the days after the mother-of-two's body was found, walked around the former Nazi bunker, talking to Greece's three major phone companies, Cosmote, Vodafone and Wind, from their own cell phones.
They talked with the phone companies' technicians and engineers while moving around the woodland and asking whether their locations were identifiable.
This is the Orthodox Academy of Crete where Dr Eaton was hosted while attending a conference and was due to be a keynote speaker 
Katerina Karkala-Zormpa (pictured), of the Orthodox academy, was one of the last people to see her alive and  told DailyMail.com she was 'in a good mood and laughing' before her final run
A source said: 'They did this because they wanted to test close to the cave their own phones and co-ordinates and then with the help of GPS mapping and computer data find out which other mobile phones have been in that area in the last week.
'It is a lonely spot and there is no reason really except for hikers or cave explorers, for anybody to go there.
'If the killers had their phone, they think that is enough to find them.
'There cannot be very many people who go there and if that is the evening her body was left there, they will be looking for the owners of the cell phones picked up in the area during that time.'
Those visiting the area found strong 4G signal strength on their cell phones, boosted by two towering phone masts nearby.
It was also revealed that the killer dumped the body of Dr Eaton, which was still dressed in her running gear, down a shaft, an approximate 40-foot drop.
They did so by removing a wooden pallet from the shaft and dropping the body down where it landed face down, around 200ft inside the labyrinth of passages that pass through the cave. 
Police and forensic officers have carried out a thorough examination of the cave, close to Xamoudochori and their discarded plastic gloves and other debris littered the opening to the cave, which is partially blocked by a fallen tree and accessible only on all fours.
