3,"4 days after winning World Cup, Bayliss appointed SRH head coach","Four days after leading England to 2019 World Cup victory, Trevor Bayliss has been appointed as SunRisers Hyderabad head coach. The 56-year-old Australian's tenure with England will come to an end after the Ashes. It will be Bayliss' second stint in the Indian Premier League, having already led KKR to two IPL titles during his tenure from 2012 to 2015.",CricTracker,"The Sunrisers Hyderabad (SRH) has appointed England’s World Cup-winning coach Trevor Bayliss as the head coach of the franchise. This comes as a surprising move as the team had done well under the watchful eyes of Tom Moody over the last few years. SRH won the Indian Premier League (IPL) title in 2016 and also made it to the final in 2018 under him. The franchise has now parted ways with Moody and signed Bayliss for the top job.Tom Moody was with the franchise for the last seven years and during his stint, SRH qualified for the playoffs on five occasions and won the trophy under David Warner‘s captaincy in 2016. In a press release which confirmed Trevor Bayliss’ appointment, the franchise thanked Moody for his superb work with the team and wished the former Australian cricketer for his future endeavours.Advertisement“We would like to thank Tom Moody, who has made an enormous impact with the franchise, helping us achieve 5 playoff appearances over the past 7 years including a much treasured championship in 2016. We would also like to thank him for his work ethic and leadership over our journey and wish him all the success moving forward,” the press release read.Trevor Bayliss has been at the centre stage of England’s resurgence in the limited-overs format. He, along with captain Eoin Morgan, turned the fortunes of the team and they deservedly won the World Cup only a few days ago at Lord’s. Bayliss is likely to resign from the helm post the Ashes series and the SRH has grabbed the opportunity to sign him for the upcoming season.“After very careful consideration, the SunRisers franchise has decided to take a new direction with the Head Coaching role and will be parting ways with the services of Tom Moody. Trevor Bayliss, England’s 2019 World Cup-winning coach, has been appointed Head Coach of SunRisers Hyderabad. Trevor has already won 2 IPL trophies with KKR and has also won the Big Bash League and Champions League with Sydney Sixers.“He is a proven winner and we feel that his successful track record will be ideal in taking SunRisers Hyderabad forward,” the release further read. The SRH will now be hoping that Bayliss continues his good run as the coach with them as well and work wonders with the team in IPL 2020.",https://www.crictracker.com/ipl-sunrisers-hyderabad-appoint-trevor-bayliss-as-the-head-coach/?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

81,Abdul Razzaq reveals he has had 5-6 affairs after marriage,"Former Pakistan all-rounder Abdul Razzaq, during a TV programme, said that he has had ""five-six affairs that also had a validity of 1-1.5 years"". He further said that all those affairs happened after he got married. ""How do people laugh and clap at such statements? Won't be laughing when they're at [the] receiving end,"" a user tweeted reacting to it.",CricTracker,"Former Pakistan all-rounder Abdul Razzaq had said after his country’s heavy defeat to arch-rivals India in the cricket World Cup 2019 that he would like to coach Hardik Pandya to make him as one of the best all-rounders in world cricket. Razzaq had also made a controversial remark after India’s loss to England that seamer Mohammed Shami performed well in the match because he is a Muslim (Shami took 5 for 69 in that game). Razzaq’s frustration was understandable since Pakistan’s chances of making the quarter-finals had taken a huge blow after India lost the match.And now, the 39-year-old former cricketer has confessed that will certainly put the cricketing world on fire once again. Razzaq made his bold confession while speaking on a TV programme. The former batting all-rounder said he has had five-six extramarital affairs that also had a validity of 1-1.5 years. And when the astonished anchor asked him whether those had happened before marriage, Razzaq said they had happened after his conjugal life started.AdvertisementRazzaq’s confessions took all those who present on the show by surprise. The man had represented Pakistan in 46 Tests, 265 ODIs and 32 T20Is. He scored over 8,000 runs and took 389 wickets in international cricket.In a matter of coincidence, Hardik Pandya too had made a similar confession on a reality show back in January. He was accused of making sexist remarks related to women and the episode had seen him getting suspended, along with KL Rahul who was also on the programme, although temporarily.He missed the ODI series in Australia and a couple of games in New Zealand and it was a big blow for the cricketer who was just about to make a comeback after a long stint with an injury. Nevertheless, Hardik made it to the World Cup and produced a decent performance for his team, both with the bat and ball.About his coaching proposal for Hardik, Razzaq had said in his tweets: “Today I have been closely observing Pandya and I see a lot of faults in his body balance while hitting the bowl hard. I observed his footwork as well and I see that has also let him down sometimes. If I can give him coaching, for example in the UAE, I can make him one of the better all-rounders, if not the best. If the BCCI wants to make him a better all-rounder I will always be available.”",https://www.crictracker.com/former-pakistan-all-rounder-abdul-razzaq-reveals-he-had-5-6-extramarital-affairs-after-marriage/?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

""I won't look back and say I redeemed myself. I am an athlete and a cricketer and it's what we are paid to do, to win trophies,"" he added.",CricTracker,"On July 14, Sunday, the world saw probably the best ODI of all time between England and New Zealand, which was also the final of the ICC World Cup 2019.

Somehow, they posted 241/8 in 50 overs. Their bowlers reduced England to 89/4 and then in pressure, Ben Stokes and Jos Buttler added over 100 runs to bring the team back in the final.

However, the England all-rounder Ben Stokes revealed that he wasn’t ready to go out there and bat again with Jos Buttler, as he was angry at not finishing the game.“I was annoyed at myself, I was angry, I thought I’d thrown it away but when I went upstairs I had to give myself five minutes because Morgs (Morgan) wanted me to go back out and do the super over. I said that we should send Jos [Buttler] and Jason [Roy] out but Morgs said we need a left and right because it’s a small boundary. I had to go out the back into the shower room and give myself five minutes. ‘I never want to be involved in one [super over] ever again,” the 28-year-old all-rounder was quoted as saying by timesnownews.England managed 15 runs in 6 balls with Stokes hitting a six off Boult.

The police said it has been understood that the victim had multiple arrears in his exam. In May, two students killed themselves inside the same campus.",The News Minute,"On Monday, students and faculty at the SRM Institute of Science and Technology Kattankulathur campus (Kancheepuram district) woke up to devastating news. A 21-year-old student had killed himself in the campus. This was the third such incident inside the 250-acre campus in a span of 60 days, and all three students used the same method. While police sources say that the institute should have done more to avoid the deaths, faculty and some students tell TNM that this was not a case of institutional oversight.Sree Raghav, a final year B.Tech student from Kanyakumari district, killed himself on Monday. The police are investigating the incident, but as per the first round of questioning, it has been understood that the victim had multiple arrears in his exam. In May, two students killed themselves inside the same Kattankulathur campus of the college, though different reasons were attributed to their suicides. The method that all three students used was the same, and all of them had accessed restricted areas of the campus.(NOTE: TNM will not be revealing the method of suicide as mental health experts urge that such reporting may lead to more copycat suicides.)A press statement from SRM Institute of Engineering and Technology expressed anguish over the incident and stated that as a policy, support and guidance is being offered by the college to students who are in need of counselling. However, speaking to TNM about Sree Raghav's suicide, a police officer at the Maraimalai Nagar station, in whose jurisdiction the college falls, said that the college should have been more careful in watching over its students.""There have been two other suicides very recently in the same campus. The college should have installed preventive measures, and at least cordoned off restricted areas. But when our officers went for inquiry, they found that no such precautionary measures have been taken,” he said.A professor at the college, however, told TNM that the institute had taken precautions, and the restricted area had been opened for some maintenance work only. The staff member, however, added that there is no clarity on how the students managed to access a restricted area in the previous two cases of suicides in the same campus.A student of SRM said that students also get mailers frequently, telling them about counselling options available in case they need them. They also have a counsellor on campus, he said.Psychological rehabilitation crucial“People who are mentally disturbed or are in bereavement are vulnerable to copycat suicides. When they see others killing themselves, they tend to feel that it is the way out and follow them. Copycat suicides also happen among people who try it for fun and end up losing their lives,” explained Vandhana, a Chennai-based clinical psychologist. She added that following suicide attempts, while families and friends focus on physical health of the person who has survived, they do not focus as much on emotional well being.“So what happens when the trauma is raw is that the next time they get triggered and attempt to kill themselves, it ends in death,” she said.If you’re worried about a person’s mental health, there are some behavioural changes you can look out for.Vandhana added that more suicide prevention helplines must be set up to address this issue in a holistic manner. Mass media must also do its part in preventing suicides, she added.“Movies that give warning for alcohol and drugs, do not give similar warning for suicides. These warning one-liners don’t compensate for anything. We need to create more warning signs that are visible,” she said.Making it clear that suicides do not happen in one day, Vandhana said that these build over a period of time and hence suicide prevention helplines must ideally double up and act as helplines which can aid people who need help to call and talk about their pain.Read: Some steps you can take to help a loved one struggling with mental health If you or anyone you know is feeling depressed or suicidal, consider reaching out to one of the following helplines:Tamil Nadu: State health department suicide helpline number - 104Sneha Suicide Prevention Centre - 044-24640050Telangana:  Telangana government suicide prevention toll free number - 104 Roshni- 040-66202000, 66202001SEVA- 09441778290, 040 - 27504682 (between 9 AM and 7 PM)Karnataka:Sahai : 24-hour helpline numbers: 080- 65000111, 080-65000222Kerala:Maithri helpline - 0484-2540530Chaithram helpline: 0484-2361161Both are 24-hour helpline numbers.Andhra Pradesh: Life Suicide Prevention Helpline No.78930-78930 Roshni - Helpline 1: 9166202000 Helpline 2: 9127848584",https://www.thenewsminute.com/article/copycat-suicides-srm-institute-what-colleges-families-and-friends-must-do-105615?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

109,Shubman should be groomed for India's no. 4 batting spot: Whatmore,"Former Sri Lanka coach Dav Whatmore has said that batsman Shubman Gill should be groomed for Team India's number four batting position. ""He has got the technique to be a number four...I am sure he will have a long career,"" he added. The 19-year-old Shubman was the player of the tournament in 2018 Under-19 World Cup.",CricTracker,"The conundrum surrounding India’s number four continues to cause problems aplenty for the Team. The problem started right after Yuvraj Singh was dropped in mid-2017. Since then, India have tried out a number of batsmen without much success. The experimentation started with KL Rahul and later the likes of Dinesh Karthik, Hardik Pandya and Suresh Raina were tested. However, those experiments did not yield the desired result.India then recalled Ambati Rayudu in 2018 and it looked like the team’s search was finally over. A good show in the Asia Cup, a fine century against West Indies and some handy knocks in Australia and New Zealand bolstered Rayudu’s reputation. However, the team surprisingly dropped him for the World Cup after his poor outing in the home series against Australia. India instead picked Vijay Shankar who looked anything but impressive in England before an injury ruled him out of the tournament.AdvertisementIndia then tried out Rishabh Pant at that crucial position. The youngster played some handy knocks but clearly lacked the temperament to excel at number four. The middle-order was one of the reasons why India bowed out of the World Cup at the semifinal stage.With India struggling to find a reliable number four, celebrated coach Dav Whatmore opines Shubman Gill can solve the problem. Whatmore rightly said that India failed to solve their middle-order woes. At the same time, he also had some words of praise for the Men in Blue’s performance in the World Cup.“The No. 4 issue kept raising its head. India should look at the future. Shubman Gill is a fantastic young batsman and he could well fill that slot. He’s got the technique,” Whatmore was quoted as saying by Sportstar.“India had a good tournament. It topped the group after nine matches, made runs, had a very good bowling attack, both pace and spin. But India ran into New Zealand in the semifinal, and the Kiwis made full use of helpful conditions. It’s just one defeat in a World Cup semifinal that can happen to any team. New Zealand did too much damage in the first 10 overs. India has got some powerful stroke makers and a potent attack.

114,Kerala IPS officer Merin Joseph brings child rape accused from Saudi,"A team led by Kollam Police Commissioner Merin Joseph arrested a man accused of raping a 13-year-old Kerala girl from Saudi Arabia and brought him to India on Tuesday. The accused, a Kollam native who works in Saudi Arabia, allegedly raped his friend's niece for three months in 2017. The child and her uncle later committed suicide.",The News Minute,"On Sunday, Kollam Police Commissioner Merin Joseph IPS and her team left to Riyadh in Saudi Arabia. Merin was unsure of the procedures that would follow once she landed in Riyadh, but one thing she was sure of, she would return to India with Sunil Kumar Bhadran (38), a man wanted in a child rape case.Sunil Kumar, a native of Kollam, was a tile worker in Saudi Arabia. In 2017, while he was holidaying in Kerala, he sexually assaulted his friend’s niece for three months. The 13-year-old girl, who belonged to a scheduled caste community, was devastated and finally revealed her ordeal to her family. By the time the police issued a lookout notice, Sunil had fled to Saudi Arabia.  The girl was later moved to Government Mahila Mandiram rescue home at Karicode in Kollam district. However, she killed herself in June 2017. Before this, the victim’s paternal uncle who had introduced Sunil Kumar to the family had also killed himself.Merin, who took charge as the Kollam Commissioner in June 2019, had reviewed pending cases, with an emphasis on cases related to women and children.“I found this case and got to know that this man was absconding for almost two years. This was a case that had impacted public conscience and people were outraged at the crime. The International Investigation Agency of the Kerala police had been following up with Saudi police, we just strengthened these efforts,” she explains.Though an Interpol notice had been issued for Sunil Kumar in 2017, the case had never progressed. Many cases don’t progress though Interpol notices are issued, as it required continuous follow-up and  co-operation from the other country involved.In 2010, then  Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and Saudi King Abdulla had signed the India- Saudi extradition treaty. Despite many Keralites who were wanted in cases in the state having fled to Saudi, no extradition has happened till now. A few days ago, the Kerala police was informed that Saudi police had Sunil in custody. Though most IPS officers would have sent junior officers to secure the man, Merin chose to go herself. “This was the first time that we would be doing such an extradition. I wanted to learn how it works so that I could, in turn, share the knowledge with my team. There was a lot of paperwork, it involved the CBI and the Interpol too. We also had to make documents to bring him back. This is why I decided to go. I am also passionate about cases involving women and children, and this was a man I believed should be brought back to face trial,"" she told TNM.Sunil Kumar Bhadran has now become the first person to be extradited for a crime committed in Kerala. And this, will perhaps pave the way for many more criminals seeking refuge in Saudi to be brought back.

We don’t want it’,” James Anderson said while speaking on the BBC’s Tailenders podcast.Anderson also praised Stokes for having the presence of mind to ask the umpire not to add those four runs to England’s total. “But it’s in the rules and that’s the way it is. It’s been talked about for a while among the players, potentially that being a dead ball if it does hit the batsman and veer off somewhere.“It was truly an incredible question to ask of the umpires, considering the gravity of the situation and the fact it would have left England struggling to force a tie after 50 overs of batting,” Anderson further added.",https://www.crictracker.com/ben-stokes-had-asked-the-umpires-to-overturn-four-overthrow-runs-james-anderson/

Several students had complained that Raveen made lewd remarks about their clothes, harassed them and behaved inappropriately during a department trip earlier this year. Another faculty Samuel Tennyson was accused of abetting Raveen's behaviour.",The News Minute,"The Madras Christian College in Chennai has sacked a professor from the department of Zoology after he was found guilty of sexually harassing the female students of the department during a college tour. R Raveen, who was an assistant professor in the Zoology department was dismissed after a detailed inquiry by the college Internal Complaints Committee into the incident. His colleague Samuel Tennyson, another faculty from the department, too had been accused of abetting Raveen's behaviour. However, the college is yet to dismiss Samuel due to a case filed by him on the issue in the Madras High Court. MCC's principal Alexander Jesudasan confirmed the dismissal. ""We have dismissed the professor after the ICC found him guilty of multiple cases of sexual harassment against students of the department. As for Samuel, the college cannot issue a dismissal order as there is a court case pending on the issue. However, the court has directed Samuel not to enter the campus premises,"" the principal said. A student from the Zoology department also added that the dismissed professor had not visited the college for over three weeks. ""Ever since college re-opened in June, he has not been coming to college. I had enquired with the other staff of the department and they also said that his attendance book showed that he was 'officially dismissed as per government norms',” the student added. In February this year, the dismissed professor along with Samuel Tennyson had taken a group of 50 students to Karnataka as part of a college excursion. During the trip, several girl students complained that the professor in question made lewd remarks about their clothes, harassed them and behaved inappropriately. They also alleged that throughout the trip, Tennyson had abetted Raveen’s behaviour by encouraging him. On returning to Chennai, the students complained to the Head of the Department who dismissed their complaints, calling it a 'first time offence' by the said teacher. Later, a petition signed by 30 odd students of the department protesting the college's lack of initiative in addressing the issue caught the attention of the authorities. An ICC inquiry was held on the issue, and statements of the students who were subjected to harassment and the accused professors were recorded. On May 24, the ICC released the results of the inquiry which found both the professors guilty. ""We have not not received any official intimation by the college authorities regarding the professor's dismissal. However, we heard from teachers of the department that action has been taken. Further, the headmaster even confirmed this to the media,"" the student added.Read our earlier report on the issue: 2 Madras Christian College profs found guilty of sexual harassment by internal panel",https://www.thenewsminute.com/article/win-students-madras-christian-college-dismisses-prof-found-guilty-sexual-harassment-105563?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

The 27-year-old has reportedly confessed to the murder, with the police saying sexual abuse was a likely motive. The body of Eaton, a molecular biologist, was found by the Greek authorities inside a bunker used by the Nazis during WWII.",Daily Mail,"Suzanne Eaton (pictured) body was found deep at the bottom of a caveA man has been arrested for the murder of American biologist Suzanne Eaton. He is a 27-year-old father of two, DailyMail.com can reveal.Police sources said he was arrested over the weekend and has reportedly confessed to killing Dr Eaton. Detective believed that only a local person would have known the locality of the hidden cave, which was a former Nazi bunker. The detained man is believed to come from Maleme, which is a only a few miles from the hidden 200-feet long cave’s location. Sources said police believed the suspect, a local farmer, had a sexual motive.Dr Eaton was attacked as she walked back to the convention center she had been staying at.‘He hit her with his car to stop her from running and then stabbed her’ said the source.Police found him by tracing his cell phone to the area and found his car tracks near the cave.  Dr Eaton's body landed face down, around 200 feet inside the labyrinth of passages that pass through this cave (pictured)Local villagers said they believed only somebody from the area would have known about the cave, which is off a dust track and then involves a trek through rugged woodland and is not visible easily to the naked eye or from the roadPolice believe she was picked up from the road outside the fishing village of Afrata and suffocated, before being dumped through a shaft into the caveDr. Eaton's body was found deep at the bottom of a cave which was used by Nazis to store ammunition during the second World War.Crete has groups of Nazi fanatics and supporters who trade in memorabilia and souvenirs left behind by soldiers.Police believe the location of the caves would only have been known to a few around there and particularly those with an interest in Nazi background.   It comes as Dr Eaton's family pay heartfelt tributes to her.Her mother, son Max, brother Rob and her sister have broken their silence to remember the 59-year-old scientist who was suffocated and stabbed after going out walking. Her mother Glynda said: ‘She was a devoted wife and mother, and dearly loved by her family. ‘From the day Suzanne was brought to me right after she was born - stuffed into a red Christmas stocking, December 23 - not drowsy and sleepy but with her head up, her eyes alert, that interest in everything around her has never changed.‘It has been a joy to share her love of books and music, to observe the combination of a certain flamboyancy with a calm, thoughtful, steady personality.‘Her accomplishments are many and varied: avid gardener, accomplished pianist, black belt in Taekwondo, and of course her contributions to developmental biology.’Dr Eaton left the Orthodox academy for a run and was discovered in a World War II cave near the settlement of Xamoudochori on Monday nighOne of her two sons Max added that he would always ‘cherish’ her memory.He added: ‘My mother was a remarkable woman.‘She managed to live a life with few regrets, balancing out her personal life with her career.‘I think the fact that I did not realize how well she had managed to do so was evident that other mothers around me had taken to caring for their children full time, yet mine was never outdone by any of them.‘Supportive and encouraging, she nurtured and supported anything that the distractible mind of my childhood would come up with, and this curiosity has stuck with me to this day.‘As I grew, her brilliance as a scientist began to dawn on me. Always armed with a question, she would show interest in any topic broached.‘Many a time I discussed topics with her that I had studied at university, and within a week, she would be as well versed in that topic as any of my professors.‘Yet she was far more than a scientist. Her love for music shone brightly, her eyes lit up every time she talked about a piece she was playing, and she would laugh with me in admiration of the sheer complexity of a piano arrangement.‘I have many fond memories of her and my father playing duets together, filling our home with a beautiful, joyful sound that was unique to them, and I shall forever cherish the memory of lying on the floor, watching and listening to the thing that brought them together.’Dr Eaton’s younger sister, in a written tribute, said: ‘Sue is too great a person for her legacy to be defined in any way by how we lost her.‘I can’t help but think that if Suzanne were here, she would know how to write this statement.‘She was good with words and it didn’t matter if it was a personal expression of grief or joy or a scientific paper on endocannabinoids.‘She took great pleasure in preparing exquisite meals and had an exotic fashion sense.‘She loved perfume. She taught and practiced Taekwondo as a second degree black belt. She finished crossword puzzles way too quickly, played concertos, and read extensively.‘She fitted Jane Austin’s strictest description of an ""accomplished woman"" while maintaining a natural humility and ""insatiable curiosity"".‘She worried that it was impossible to give both her science and her family her all. But anyone who read of her accomplishments in the field of molecular and developmental biology, or who witnessed her joy in tutoring, comforting, and inspiring her children, or sharing with, and loving her husband, would not have suspected.‘With a deep sensitivity and compassion, she somehow made us all a priority.‘We are immensely proud of her. It was her words that finally helped me deal with death, and she was in the process of teaching me how to live. So, I will continue on that journey.‘I have made a conscious decision not to allow those facts to haunt my memory. My memory will be one of pure joy and gratitude, of love and admiration for an arm in arm sister, a closest confidant, a strong, kind, brilliant, selfless human being who made indelible contributions to science and added immeasurable beauty to our lives.Her brother Rib said: ‘I have lost a sister. The world has lost more than it will ever know. Suzanne brought a new perspective to everything.‘As a scientist she would pull together the threads of common knowledge from other disciplines to create profound new understandings in her own. As a chef she could make the most exotic dish seem simple and homey.'I will miss our animated conversations. I would always walk away with a head full of new ideas and enthusiasm. Most of all I will miss the kindest, wisest person I will probably ever know.’  An 85-year-old gardener and an elderly fisherman have both independently told detectives they saw Dr Eaton in the village of Afrata, which is three miles from the place she had been staying.Officers now believe Dr Eaton disappeared a mile outside of Afrata as she made her way back to the Orthodox Academy of Crete where she was due to be a keynote conference speaker. Police have questioned several people and detained possible suspects, believing they are close to finding Dr Eaton's killer, DailyMail.com can reveal She had fought for her life against an attacker armed with a knife, and suffered substantial knife wounds to her body, police sources told ABC. The witnesses are adamant she came into the picturesque former fishing village, which does not have street surveillance cameras and is surrounded by cliffs and olive fields, before turning back towards the academy.The retired gardener, who asked not to be identified, told DailyMail.com: 'I saw her and I recognized her from the photographs of her. I also told police correctly the pink and purple colors of her clothing.'She was walking quite fast near a bridge and small church on the road out of the village. I was walking and she walked past me. I am sad about what has happened to her.'It is believed she met her killer or killers on the road out of Afrata and may have become exhausted in the 90-degree heat and through having walked four miles.She had walked north out of the academy and her body was found about six miles away south of the academy in a cave which had been a Nazi bunker during the Second World War.It is thought she was picked up from the road outside Afrata and suffocated and stabbed, before being dumped through a shaft into the cave at Xamoudochori. Her body had still not been released to her British husband and forensic tests are being conducted to see if she had been raped.Coroner Antonis Papadomanolakis told local news outlets: 'Her death was not immediate. It is not like in a shooting. There was duration involved.'One of the last people to see her alive, Katerina Karkala-Zormpa of the Orthodox Academy of Crete, told DailyMail.com: 'She was in a good mood and laughing as she came through the reception.'She played the piano and then went out. She always felt safe here and it was her fourth visit.'She felt so comfortable here, she left her room unlocked with the key inside and her belongings.''It was a great shock when we heard that she was missing. She used to take walks whenever she was here and I could not believe she had got lost,' Karkala-Zormpa said. 'Her family came here and worked so hard to find her. They were always sending emails and on the telephone and helping the search.Her body had still not been released to her British husband Tony Hyman (pictured) and forensic tests are being conducted to see if she had been raped 'It was so sad when her body was discovered but in some way it was a relief because at least they knew what had happened. Of course they wanted to find her alive, but after a week they just needed to know.''After she had died, we found out what a brilliant scientist she was and the incredible research she had done. She was very modest and did not make a big deal about her achievements,' she added. 'The whole matter had been very difficult and we hope the killer or killers are found as soon as possible.'She said Dr Eaton was an experienced and fit hiker and would not normally have accepted a ride from strangers.Police are also talking to cell phone companies on Crete that the murderer or murderers possibly had on them when they suffocated and stabbed her before dumping her body.Authorities are trying to establish whether a phone signal was picked up by cell phone masts close to the remote olive fields where her body was found.Crucially, they have pin-pointed a two-hour period on the night of Tuesday, July 2 when several phone signals were picked up in an area which they believe would have been known to them and few from outside the area.DailyMail.com previously revealed that officers, in the days after the mother-of-two's body was found, walked around the former Nazi bunker, talking to Greece's three major phone companies, Cosmote, Vodafone and Wind, from their own cell phones.They talked with the phone companies' technicians and engineers while moving around the woodland and asking whether their locations were identifiable.This is the Orthodox Academy of Crete where Dr Eaton was hosted while attending a conference and was due to be a keynote speaker Katerina Karkala-Zormpa (pictured), of the Orthodox academy, was one of the last people to see her alive and  told DailyMail.com she was 'in a good mood and laughing' before her final runA source said: 'They did this because they wanted to test close to the cave their own phones and co-ordinates and then with the help of GPS mapping and computer data find out which other mobile phones have been in that area in the last week.'It is a lonely spot and there is no reason really except for hikers or cave explorers, for anybody to go there.'If the killers had their phone, they think that is enough to find them.'There cannot be very many people who go there and if that is the evening her body was left there, they will be looking for the owners of the cell phones picked up in the area during that time.'Those visiting the area found strong 4G signal strength on their cell phones, boosted by two towering phone masts nearby.It was also revealed that the killer dumped the body of Dr Eaton, which was still dressed in her running gear, down a shaft, an approximate 40-foot drop.They did so by removing a wooden pallet from the shaft and dropping the body down where it landed face down, around 200ft inside the labyrinth of passages that pass through the cave. Police and forensic officers have carried out a thorough examination of the cave, close to Xamoudochori and their discarded plastic gloves and other debris littered the opening to the cave, which is partially blocked by a fallen tree and accessible only on all fours. ",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-7249367/Greek-police-arrest-man-27-murder-biologist-Crete.html?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

5,I didn't know there'd be Super Over in case of tie in WC final: Boult,"New Zealand pacer Trent Boult, who bowled Super Over for New Zealand in 2019 World Cup final against England, has admitted he didn't know there was going to be a Super Over in the final. ""When I saw three off two that's when umpires said to us there would be a Super Over [in case of a tie],"" he added.",CricTracker,"He was one of the central figures of the eventful final of the Cricket World Cup played at the iconic Lord’s between England and New Zealand last Sunday. Trent Boult misjudged a catch from Ben Stokes and he landed on the boundary rope with the ball in his hand in the penultimate over of the match. And then, in the final over that he bowled, a deflection off Stokes’ bat hurt them as it was sent for four overthrows, turning the game in favour of the hosts.Boult returned to his country on Thursday with some of his colleagues and is yet to get over the pain of losing the title clash by the count of boundary – a rule that many had found bizarre. The 29-year-old left-arm pacer even tendered an apology, saying he was “sorry for letting everybody down” in relation to the final loss. He was also upset that he had gone for a six in the final over.

16,US Navy shoots down Iranian drone in Strait of Hormuz,"US President Donald Trump on Thursday said that a US Navy ship had ""destroyed"" an Iranian drone in the Strait of Hormuz after the aircraft threatened the vessel. He added that the drone had flown to within 1,000 yards of the ship and had ignored ""multiple calls to stand down"". Iran in June shot down a US military surveillance drone.",Reuters,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States said on Thursday that a U.S. Navy ship had “destroyed” an Iranian drone in the Strait of Hormuz after the aircraft threatened the vessel, but Iran said it had no information about losing a drone.     In the latest episode to stir tensions in the Gulf, U.S. President Donald Trump told an event at the White House that the drone had flown to within 1,000 yards (meters) of the USS Boxer and had ignored “multiple calls to stand down.” “This is the latest of many provocative and hostile actions by Iran against vessels operating in international waters. The United States reserves the right to defend our personnel, facilities and interests,” Trump said.     “The drone was immediately destroyed,” he added. Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif told reporters at the United Nations: “We have no information about losing a drone today.” The Pentagon said in a statement that the USS Boxer, an amphibious assault ship, had taken “defensive action” against a drone on Thursday morning as the Boxer was moving into the Strait of Hormuz.  “We do assess it was an Iranian drone,” said Commander Rebecca Rebarich, a Pentagon spokeswoman.   Tensions in the Gulf region are high, with fears that the United States and Iran could stumble into war. The United States has blamed Iran for a series of attacks since mid-May on shipping around the Strait of Hormuz, the world’s most important oil artery. Tehran rejects the allegations. Iran in June shot down a U.S. military surveillance drone in the Gulf with a surface-to-air missile. Iran says the drone was in its airspace, but Washington says it was in international skies. Trump said at the time the United States had come close to launching a military strike on Iran in retaliation for the downing of the U.S. drone.    The increased use of drones by Iran and its allies for surveillance and attacks across the Middle East is raising alarms in Washington.  The United States believes that Iran-linked militia in Iraq have recently increased their surveillance of American troops and bases in the country by using off-the-shelf, commercially available drones, U.S. officials say. A U.S. official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the drone on Thursday was brought down through electronic jamming.  Tension in the Strait of Hormuz: tmsnrt.rs/32tzK6J Relations between the United States and Iran have worsened since last year when Trump abandoned a 2015 deal between world powers and Iran in which Tehran agreed to restrict nuclear work in return for the lifting of sanctions.     The United States has reimposed sanctions to throttle Iran’s oil trade and says it wants to increase pressure on Tehran to renegotiate the accord, discuss its ballistic missile program and modify its behavior in the Middle East, where Washington is allied to several Arab states opposed to Iran. Iran’s clerical rulers have ruled out renegotiating the nuclear deal or holding talks on its missile program, which it says is purely defensive.  But Zarif told reporters on Thursday that Iran had offered to make a concession on its nuclear program - to ratify a document prescribing more intrusive inspections - if the United States abandoned its economic sanctions - a proposal that drew U.S. skepticism. “If Iran wants to make a serious gesture, it should start by ending uranium enrichment immediately,” a U.S. senior administration official said, adding any talks should include “a permanent end to Iran’s malign nuclear ambitions, including its development of nuclear-capable missiles.”  Earlier on Thursday, the United States demanded Iran immediately release a vessel it seized in the Gulf, and a U.S. military commander in the region said the United States would work “aggressively” to ensure free passage of vessels through the vital waterway.     Iran played down the seizure of the ship, which it said was a small vessel that was smuggling oil. Iranian state TV aired footage of a vessel called “RIAH.”   The Panamanian-flagged oil tanker MT Riah disappeared off trackers in Iranian territorial waters days ago.  “We do this (inspecting ships) every day. These are people who smuggle our oil,” Iran’s Press TV quoted Zarif as saying, adding: “It was a small ship used to smuggle 1 million liters – not 1 million barrels – of crude oil.”      Washington has recently beefed up its military presence and the U.S. Fifth Fleet, based in Bahrain, says that Gulf Arab states have stepped up patrols. Revolutionary Guards Commander-in-Chief Hossein Salami said on Thursday that Iran had adopted a defensive strategy, but warned that “if our enemies make any mistakes ... our strategy can become an offensive one.” Oil prices jumped on Thursday after news of the ship seizure. They later fell, however, on weakness in U.S. equities markets and an expectation that crude output would rise in the Gulf of Mexico following last week’s hurricane in the region.    The United States on Thursday imposed sanctions on an international network of companies and their agents it said were involved in the procurement of materials for Iran’s nuclear program.

19,Knew Neymar wanted to leave before Copa: PSG manager Tuchel,"French side Paris Saint-Germain manager Thomas Tuchel said he was aware that Neymar ""wanted to leave"" the club before Copa America. ""I am always disappointed when a player turns up late but it's clear between us, now it's between the club and Neymar,"" Tuchel added. This comes amid reports of Neymar being linked with a return to former club, Barcelona.",Times Now,"There's no bigger player than Neymar which is being discussed in the current transfer market. The Paris Saint-Germain forward has been seen flirting with former club Barcelona hoping to return to Camp Nou but the sort of money that is required to avail his services is making things difficult for the Spanish outfit. Although the Brazilian hasn't publicly expressed his intentions of leaving France, manager Thomas Tuchel has revealed that he has been aware of the player's willingness to leave even before the Copa America 2019 started.Quite possibly giving their best attempt towards signing Neymar, Barca had reportedly offered Ousmane Dembele, Philippe Coutinho and EUR 40 million to sign their former forward but the attempt has been rebuffed by the Ligue 1 champions, who, as per media reports, are only interested in signing the player for cash.Amid such a situation where the player doesn't want to remain a part of the club, but is finding it increasingly difficult to force his way out, the biggest headache lies on the head of the manager - whose job is to get the best out of the player despite the fact that he is unsettled at the club.Tuchel, who arrived in France last season, said that the topic will be discussed between the club and the player. As far as the German is concerned, things have already been made all clear.""I knew that he wanted to go before the Copa America, but it's a topic between the club and Neymar,"" Tuchel was quoted as saying.""It's all clear between us, now it's up to the club and Neymar.""We work together, it's something between the club and him.""Neymar seems to be on the move but there aren't many clubs in the world that can afford him. The 27-year-old had arrived at PSG in 2017 in a EUR 222 million move but the French giants' inability to progress as a competitive side has left him frustrated.In case a return to Barcelona falls through, Neymar might look to try his luck with one of the other big clubs, including Barcelona's arch-rivals Real Madrid - who seem to have the wherewithal to cater to PSG's demands.Neymar wasn't a part of the PSG side that defeated Dynamo Dresden 6-1 in a pre-season friendly on Tuesday. Last season's top-scorer Kylian Mbappe scored a brace for the team while Julian Draxler also found the net in the convincing victory.While the league has been a cakewalk for PSG for the past few seasons, it's the Champions League where they would be put to test again, especially if Neymar manages to leave.",https://www.timesnownews.com/sports/football/article/knew-neymar-wanted-to-leave-psg-even-before-copa-america-2019-thomas-tuchel/455144?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

The murder mystery game features immersive background sounds and over 2,500 lines of dialogue performed by actors portraying 12 different characters. Available on Amazon for about ₹2,800, it doesn't include the Alexa device itself.",Engadget,"Alexa could add color and suspense to your murder mystery game nights if it's getting a bit stale lately. X2 Games, created by Atari co-founder Nolan Bushnell and Hollywood creative director Zai Ortiz, has released an Alexa-powered board game entitled St. Noire. And, yes, it's exclusively available through Amazon. To be clear, you won't be hearing Alexa's robotic voice when you play the game, so you don't have to worry about the assistant ruining your immersion. The technology simply powers the game's immersive background sounds and cinematic voice performances, which are made up of over 2,500 lines of dialogue performed by actors portraying 12 different characters. The game randomizes the identity of the killer and the victim every playthrough to keep things fresh. As the hard-boiled detective solving the mystery, you'll have to visit various locations (including seedy bars, of course) in the game to talk to characters. Not everyone will be telling you the truth, obviously, so you'll have to find inconsistencies in their statement and piece clues together to find the culprit.Ortiz said they were really excited with the prospect of ""gamifying voice technology by fusing cinematic storytelling with board games."" He added: ""By incorporating voice-control mechanics into the traditional tabletop format, we are transforming the board game landscape, as well as pushing the boundaries of what Smart Speaker gaming means.""St. Noire is now available on Amazon for $40, but that doesn't include the Alexa device itself. We hope you got an Alexa device during Prime Day if you're a murder mystery fan looking to give this a try. In the coming days, the game will also debut at San Diego Comic Con, where Bushnell and Ortiz will be speaking about it and ""gamification technology' as the future of gaming.",https://www.engadget.com/2019/07/18/st-noire-alexa-detective-board-game/?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts
