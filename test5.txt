MSK Prasad reveals why Rayudu wasn't picked after injuries to players
Chief selector MSK Prasad has revealed that injured opener Shikhar Dhawan was replaced by Rishabh Pant instead of Ambati Rayudu during 2019 World Cup as the team already had a reserve opener in KL Rahul and required a left-hander. He added that when all-rounder Vijay Shankar was injured, they called in Mayank Agarwal as the team needed a back-up opener.

Seniors purposely didn't perform, laughed after defeats: Naib
All-rounder Gulbadin Naib, who was Afghanistan's captain in 2019 World Cup, has claimed that his team's senior players didn't perform deliberately in the tournament. "They weren't giving attention to me. They laughed instead of being sad after defeats and didn't even look at me when asked to bowl," he added. Notably, Naib was removed from captaincy after the World Cup.

Afghanistan endured an extremely tough time at the 2019 World Cup. They lost all nine matches at the competition despite coming extremely close to victory on as many as three occasions. Their captain Gulbadin Naib looked a bit out of ideas at times and was unable to handle the pressure and after the tournament, has been sacked from the helm. He has now made some serious allegations against the senior cricketers in the team stating that they didn’t support him during the tough times.
Afghanistan were found wanting in demanding conditions against the teams like England, Australia, New Zealand and others. But they fared really well against their Asian neighbours and dragged India extremely close losing the game by only 11 runs. Their encounter against Pakistan went down to the wire and at one stage, were the favourites to win the match.

But the team, especially Gulbadin Naib, crumbled under pressure and Imad Wasim and Wahab Riaz took Pakistan home in a tense chase.
Gulbadin Naib was made the captain of the team just ahead of the World Cup and even the players like Mohammad Nabi and Rashid Khan had expressed their disappointment over the same. While the skipper never came out with controversial statements during the tournament, he has now accused some of the senior cricketers that they were not playing well deliberately.
He also claimed that they didn’t support him on the field whenever he used to ask them to bowl at times. “We depend mostly on seniors in the World Cup but they were deliberately not performing, not giving attention to me, they were laughing instead of being sad after defeats & even not looking at me when asked to bowl,” Naib was quoted as saying by Afghanistan journalist.

Gulbadin Naib has been sacked from captaincy now and Rashid Khan has been appointed the captain of the team across all the formats. He has assured the leg-spinner of all the required support and Rashid acknowledged the same in a tweet recently.

Grey sales of high-end phones causing ₹2,500 cr revenue loss: ICEA
The sale of high-end mobile phones in the grey market is causing an estimated loss of ₹2,500 crore annually, mobile industry body India Cellular and Electronics Association (ICEA) has claimed. It suggested imposing a maximum customs duty of ₹4,000 on handsets priced above ₹20,000 to stop the practice. Currently, a basic customs duty of 20% is imposed on imported handsets.
https://www.financialexpress.com/industry/grey-sales-of-high-end-phones-causing-revenue-loss-of-rs-2500-crore-icea/1651427/?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts
The Financial Express
Sale of high-end mobile phones in the grey market is causing an estimated loss of Rs 2,500 crore annually to the exchequer, mobile industry body India Cellular and Electronics Association has claimed. The industry body has suggested imposing a maximum customs duty of Rs 4,000 on handsets priced above Rs 20,000 to discourage duty evasion and wipe out the premium for illegal sales. A basic customs duty (BCD) of 20 per cent is imposed on imported handsets at present.
“High-end phones that are getting sold in the grey market are estimated to cause a loss of Rs 2,500 crore annually on account of non-payment of basic customs duty (BCD) and also goods and services tax,” India Cellular and Electronics Association (ICEA) Chairman Pankaj Mohindroo told PTI.
The industry body has requested Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman that the BCD of 20 per cent should continue but with a cap of Rs 4,000 on mobile phones priced above Rs 20,000, Mohindroo said. The step will wipe out high margins on the illegal sale of high-end handsets and give a boost to legal imports, the ICEA has reasoned.
“Revenue impact on this would be an additional duty of Rs 700 crore of BCD approximately, which will get netted off because of the reduction in duty on the legal import. Hence, there will be no net gain or net loss. The GST collection will, however, go up by over Rs 1,000 crore and the market environment will become much cleaner and regularised,” Mohindroo said.
The ICEA said that recent budget was focussed on promoting electronics manufacturing in the country with a provision to write off capital expenditure for under section of 35 AD of Income Tax act.
“The entire mobile phone and its components manufacturing ecosystem should be brought under the finally notified scheme,” he said.The industry body has requested the government to bring down GST on mobile phone parts to 12 per cent from 18 per cent at present as it is creating an inverted duty structure in the sector.
The GST on mobile phones is 12 per cent while 18 per cent on parts such as back covers, batteries, headphones etc. Mohindroo said that the inverted duty structure has led to a serious cash flow issue for manufacturers and is adversely impacting the competitiveness of locally-produced mobile phones.
India had two mobile phone factories in 2014 but now, it has 268 factories engaged in the manufacturing of mobile phones and their accessories. Prime Minister Narendra Modi during his 13th India-Japan annual summit had announced making India top mobile phone manufacturing destination.
Though there is a mechanism in GST to provide a refund of input tax credit (ITC), there is no way to provide a refund of accumulated ITC on the GST paid on capital goods and services in case of inverted structure. “All new manufacturers are investing heavily on Capex (capital expenditure) and business promotion for creating a brand image. GST on such expense is an additional cost to the manufacturer, as they are not allowed refund of such accumulated credit,” Mohindroo said.
The ICEA has urged the finance minister to reduce timeframe for refund of GST credits to at most a week. The industry body has also demanded input credit on manufacturing plant or shed, and canteen service, among others.

Bengali actress Rimjhim Mitra, two others join BJP
Bengali film and television actress Rimjhim Mitra and two others joined the BJP in the presence of state BJP President Dilip Ghosh. Mitra said that it's the first time she is "openly supporting" a party as she felt "cornered" working under the "monopolistic approach" in the Bengali film and TV industry. On July 18, several Bengali actors joined the party.

Kolkata: Three days after 12 Bengali actors joined the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), film and television actress Rimjhim Mitra on Sunday became a part of the party. Actor Surojit Choudhury and model Pamela Goswami also followed suit.
Notably, Rimjhim is a popular TV actress who won ‘Jhalak Dikhla Jaa Bangla’ in 2013 and was also seen in Bigg Boss Bangla. She also made her mark in films, like ‘Teen Yaari Katha’ and ‘Cross Connection’.
“I am not happy working under the monopolistic approach in the Bengali film and TV industry. I have felt cornered many times and this is the first time I am openly talking about supporting a party. I have joined the BJP as I found it welcoming,” Rimjhim said after she was handed the BJP flag by its state President Dilip Ghosh.
On July 18, 12 Bengali actors, including Parno Mittra, joined the BJP. The actors had joined the party in the presence of state BJP chief Dilip Ghosh and senior leader Mukul Roy in Delhi. Film and TV personalities Rishi Kaushik, Kanchana Moitra, Rupanjana Mitra, Parno and Biswajit Ganguly were among the dozen of celebrities who cast their lot with the BJP at its Delhi headquarters.
On Saturday, Mukul Roy had claimed that as many as 107 CPM, Congress and TMC MLAs will be joining the BJP. “107 West Bengal MLAs from CPM, Congress and TMC will join BJP. We have their list prepared and they are in contact with us,” Roy had said.
Right after the Lok Sabha election results were announced, Banerjee suffered a jolt as two of her party’s MLAs and over 50 councillors joined hands with the BJP.
Besides, TMC MLAs Subhrangshu Roy (Son of BJP leader Mukul Roy) and Tusharkanti Bhattacharya, CPI(M)’s Debendra Nath Roy also defected to the saffron party in presence of senior leaders Mukul Roy and Kailash Vijayvargiya.

Central agencies threatening TMC leaders to join BJP: Mamata

West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee on Sunday, 21 July, alleged that central agencies are threatening TMC leaders and elected representatives with prison term in chit fund scam cases, if they don't join the BJP.
Addressing the Martyrs' Day rally in Kolkata, the Trinamool Congress (TMC) chief accused the saffron party of luring TMC MLAs with money and other perks.

"The BJP is offering Rs 2 crore and a petrol pump to our MLAs to switch over... Just like in Karnataka, the BJP is indulging in horse trading everywhere. It is trying to replicate this model here, too," she alleged.
Reacting to her allegations, West Bengal BJP president Dilip Ghosh dared Banerjee to name the CBI officers who had allegedly threatened TMC leaders to join the saffron camp. She, however, had not named any central agency.
The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) and the Enforcement Directorate (ED) are separately probing two multi-crore-rupee Ponzi scheme cases in West Bengal.
MAMATA SAYS RAIL SERVICES CURTAILED, RAILWAYS REFUTES CHARGE
She also claimed rail services were curtailed to stop people from attending her rally, even as the Railways maintained that it was running a number of special trains in addition to the ones scheduled for the day.
RETURN BALLOT PAPERS: MAMATA CALLS LOK SABHA ELECTIONS A ‘MYSTERY’
She also requested the EC to conduct Panchayat and Municipal elections with ballot paper instead of EVMs.
“We tell the BJP, first return the black money you used in the elections. Return the black money and cut money – all that you have taken till now – and used for winning elections,” Banerjee said.
Banerjee’s nephew, Abhishek Banerjee also joined her call against EVMs in the rally.
He said, “Return democracy, we want ballots not (EVM) machines.”
WHY IS THIS SIGNIFICANT?
The Martyrs' Day rally is organised by the party every year on July 21 in the memory of 13 Youth Congress activists killed in police firing in 1993 during the Left Front regime in West Bengal. Banerjee was a leader of the Youth Congress at that time.
This time rally is being held in the backdrop of BJP's impressive performance in the Lok Sabha polls in which the party won 18 of the 42 seats in the state, only four less than the ruling TMC.

THE CONFLICT
BJP state president and MP Dilip Ghosh directed party workers to not allow TMC leaders to leave for Kolkata to participate in the rally if they did not return the "cut money" they had collected from people.
Following this, TMC leader and minister Chandrima Bhattacharya lodged an FIR against Ghosh.
TMC MP and Mamata’s nephew Abhishek Banerjee, speaking to The Quint, said that BJP will “not be allowed to divide Bengal.”
Around 5,000 policemen will be deployed to look after security at the rally and maintain normality.

Three powerful improvised explosive devices (IEDs), suspected to have been planted by Naxals, were recovered by security forces from Chhattisgarh’s Bijapur district, police said today. The home-made bombs, weighing 15 kg, 9 kg and 5 kg, were unearthed yesterday by a joint team of the CRPF and the local police from the forests under Basaguda police station limits where a road construction work is underway, Bijapur Additional Superintendent of Police Mohit Garg told PTI. A road is being built from Basaguda (Bijapur) to Jagargunda in Sukma district, another insurgency-hit district. The 49km road is not only strategically important but also crucial for the people living in this inaccessible region, he said.
A bomb disposal squad immediately defused the explosives, which were spotted when security forces were carrying out patrolling near an under-construction bridge, the police officer said. Garg said last week, too, three powerful IEDs were recovered from two places in the same area, he said. Maoists regularly plant IEDs to target security forces during their anti-Naxal operations in the state.

Team India’s much-awaited squads for the upcoming West Indies tour were announced on Sunday and MS Dhoni‘s name was missing from both ODI and T20I teams. On Saturday, the news broke through that the veteran had made himself unavailable for the tour and since the World Cup, a lot is being said about his retirement. Expectedly, the chief selector MSK Prasad was asked a question on Dhoni’s retirement when he addressed the media.
Various reports have surfaced over the last couple of weeks speculating the MS Dhoni’s future and it was reported that the experienced player will be part of the team to groom Rishabh Pant. People close to him claimed that he will be playing the T20 World Cup next year while Dhoni’s parents wanted him to retire. However, MSK Prasad is of the opinion that taking a retirement is purely an individual call.

He also stressed the fact that a player of the stature of MS Dhoni understands when to call it quits. “A legend like MS Dhoni knows when to retire. Retirement is a purely individual call,” MSK Prasad said when asked about the 38-year-old’s retirement.
There is no doubt that MS Dhoni has played his last game at the World Cup and Rishabh Pant will take over the gloves from him when the former will retire. MSK Prasad cleared that they have laid down a few plans and one of them is grooming Pant. He also cleared that Dhoni made himself unavailable for the West Indies which clears the air about him being dropped.
“He’s unavailable for this series but we had certain roadmaps&plans till WC. Subsequently, we’ve laid down a few more plans&thought of giving as many opportunities to Pant & to see he is groomed. This is our plan right now,” the chief selector further added. With Team India set to face South Africa from September 15, anything about MS Dhoni’s future will be known before that series now.

India’s squads for the three series in the West Indies starting with three T20Is on August 3 were announced on Sunday, 11 days after the team crashed out of the 2019 World Cup. The Chief selector MSK Prasad announced the squads at a press conference in Mumbai and a number of changes were made – especially in the limited-overs squads.
Speculation of regular captain Virat Kohli taking a break from the T20Is and ODIs was buried as he was named as the skipper for all the three formats. India will play three T20Is and as many ODIs before the two-match Test series starts on August 22.

Ace pacer Jasprit Bumrah was rested for the limited-over series though he will join the Test squad. Manish Pandey, who is leading India ‘A’ in the West Indies at the moment, was picked for both the T20Is and ODI squads. Chahar brothers – Rahul and Deepak – made it along with Krunal Pandya while Washington Sundar made a return.
However, the selection committee failed to impress many who thought Mayank Agarwal also deserved a call-up in the ODI squad. The 28-year-old batsman from Karnataka was recently picked in India’s World Cup squad in England as a replacement for an injured Vijay Shankar though he did not get a game. The selection sparked controversy as standby batsman Ambati Rayudu was ignored and after being snubbed, he retired from cricket altogether.
Mayank’s selection for the World Cup squad had raised quite a few eyebrows since the man is yet to play for India in an ODI. He was picked for India’s Test squad in Australia last year and played two vital 70-run knocks in both the matches he played. But now, after the man had already featured in an ODI squad and that too at the World Cup, questions are being asked why he was left out.
Mayank has played in 75 List ‘A’ games in which he has amassed 3605 runs at an impressive average of with 12 centuries and 14 half-centuries and looks a decent enough player to be part of the team.

BJP won LS polls by using EVMs, CRPF and EC: Mamata

She alleged that the workers of the BJP are trying to capture TMC's offices and beating up workers. Mamata also accused the BJP of indulging in horse-trading by offering "₹2 crore and a petrol pump" to TMC MLAs.

India.com
New Delhi: West Bengal Chief Minister and Trinamool Congress Supremo Mamata Banerjee on Sunday claimed that the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) won the Lok Sabha elections by cheating by using EVMs, CRPF and Central Police and Election Commission.
“In Lok Sabha elections they won by cheating- by using EVMs, CRPF and Central Police & Election Commission. We want change, not revenge. You won 18 seats and are blowing your trumpet. When we had won 26 seats in the past, we didn’t take over any party office. We won with our hard work: ,” Banerjee said while addressing TMC annual Martyrs’ Day rally in Kolkata.
Banerjee also accused the ruling party of indulging in horse-trading. “The BJP is offering Rs 2 crore and a petrol pump to our MLAs to switch over. Just like in Karnataka, the BJP is indulging in horse-trading everywhere,” she alleged.
Furthermore, the Chief Minister asserted that she will request the Election Commission to conduct Panchayat and Municipal elections through ballot paper. “Do not forget that the EVMs were earlier used in England, France, Germany and America. But they have now stopped using them…. So why cannot we bring the ballot papers back?” she asked.
The TMC holds the Martyrs’ Day rally every year on July 21 in the memory of the 13 Youth Congress activists, who were killed in 1993 police firing during a political demonstration led by Mamata. Banerjee was a leader of the Youth Congress at that time and the Left Front was in power in West Bengal.

Priyanka can lead Cong, non-Gandhi will cause split: Natwar
Former External Affairs Minister Natwar Singh on Sunday said that the decision of becoming Congress President lies with Priyanka Gandhi, adding that a non-Gandhi chief will cause the party to split.

ANI
By  Ashoke Raj New Delhi [India], July 21 (ANI): With the Congress leadership in limbo after the resignation of Rahul Gandhi, party veteran Natwar Singh on Sunday joined the chorus backing Priyanka Gandhi Vadra for the top post, adding that having a non-Gandhi at the helm will cause the party to split.Praising Priyanka for her visit to Sonbhadra to meet victims of a firing incident, the former external affairs minister told ANI that she is capable of handling the party. "You must have witnessed what she did in a village in Uttar Pradesh. It was amazing. She stayed there and achieved what she wanted to," he said.Singh suggested that Rahul's decision of a having someone from outside the Gandhi family as the party chief will have to be reversed.On being asked if Priyanka would be elected as the party president, the Congressman said, "It will depend on Priyanka because her brother (Rahul Gandhi) had said that nobody from the Gandhi family will become the Congress president. Now, the family will have to reverse the decision and only they can do it."Earlier, Anil Shastri, son of former prime minister Lal Bahadur Shastri, had said that Priyanka Gandhi should be made the Congress president as no one other than her is "100 per cent acceptable".Shastri, speaking to ANI, had also warned that if somebody else is made the supremo and a section of the outfit does not accept them, chances are that the party will disintegrate.Natwar Singh echoed similar sentiments and said that if anyone is elected from outside the Gandhi family, the Congress will split within 24 hours."It is unfortunate that the country's 134-years-old party does not have a party president. I do not think apart from the Gandhi family, anyone should be elected as the president," Singh added.Around 50 days after Rahul stepped down as Congress president, taking moral responsibility for the humiliating defeat in the Lok Sabha elections, the grand old party is yet to finalize its new chief.Gandhi, now a lawmaker from Wayanad in Kerala, became the Congress president in 2017. He had, earlier this month, written a lengthy four-page letter making his resignation from the post public. Taking responsibility for the drubbing in Lok Sabha polls, Rahul had said it would not be right for him to suggest a successor.At present Congress in Goa has completely lost foot, after 10 of its MLAs switched side with the BJP. This has reduced its strength to five in the Assembly.Similarly, in Karnataka, the situation is equally embarrassing for the party, as its coalition government with JD(S) is facing a tough time. The government had slumped into a crisis following the resignation of 16 dissident MLAs and now its survival seems to be tough.The Congress won 52 seats in the recent general elections, which is just eight more than its 2014 Lok Sabha tally of 44.

Most mob lynching cases are fake: Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi
Union Minister for Minority Affairs Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi on Sunday said that most cases of mob lynching in the country are concocted and fake. Naqvi was responding to a question about Samajwadi Party leader Azam Khan's statement of Muslims being punished for not migrating to Pakistan after 1947. Congress's Randeep Surjewala criticised Naqvi saying BJP is trying to shield culprits.

Union Minister for Minority Affairs Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi told India Today on Sunday, 21 July that most of the cases of lynching are fake
This was in response to India Today’s question on Samajwadi Party leader Azam Khan’s statement of Muslims “serving a sentence” after the Partition.
Khan had said, “If Muslims went to Pakistan, they would not get this punishment. Why our ancestors did not go to Pakistan? They regarded India as their own country. Now they will be punished and they will have to endure,” adding that the Muslims of this country had been living a very “disgusting life”.
Naqvi’s statement’s was criticised by senior Congress leader Randeep Surjewala who accused the BJP of protecting the accused.
Quoting Surjewala, India Today reported, “BJP doesn’t feel anything for the minorities. Everyone in the ruling party is trying to shield the culprits.”
Since 2015, 98 people have been victims of mob lynchings across India. According to Indiaspend, 84% of the victims of lynchings due to cow-related violence were Muslims.
Naqvi isn’t alone when it comes to downplaying cases of mob lynchings.
Recently, Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar told The Print that the Saran lynching incident of two tribal men and a Muslim man shouldn’t be viewed as a case of “mob lynching” as three victims “had been caught stealing cattle”.
Kumar told The Print, “It is an unfortunate incident. But it should not be seen as mob lynching. Those killed were Nats (a Scheduled Tribe group) and those who killed them belong to downtrodden classes. The incident occurred when the three were caught red-handed stealing cattle. It resulted in angry villagers beating them up leading to their deaths. It is basically an incident arising due to local development.”
Another minister of the JD(U)-BJP state government said that it was a case of “law and order” since the victims weren’t forced to chant Jai Shri Ram.

ISRO has reacted to the teaser of the film. “Ek Desh. Ek Sapna. India to be a space superpower. Few Days to go for achieving new Milestone! #Chandrayaan2”, it wrote.
Mission Mangal is inspired by India’s 2013 Mars space programme Mangalyaan. In the teaser, we hear Akshay Kumar voice giving out an order, “This is Rakesh Dhawan.

Really enjoyed it, it was timely: Chief selector on Rayudu's '3D' tweet
Reacting to ex-India cricketer Ambati Rayudu's '3D glasses' tweet, BCCI chief selector MSK Prasad said he really enjoyed the ex-batsman's tweet. "It was a lovely tweet. That was sarcasm. It was timely," he said. Further, talking about not selecting Rayudu in 2019 World Cup squad, Prasad said, "Due to certain combinations, he wasn't picked. It doesn't make Selection Committee biased."

Ambati Rayudu even without featuring in the Indian team that played the World Cup 2019 has made more news than most other players. When he was not included in the primary squad but named as a back-up he put out the famous 3D tweet. Later when the selectors had to name replacement players, Rayudu was still not included and it was said that the reason could’ve been his tweet. However, selector MSK Prasad disagrees.
When Prasad announced the India squads for West Indies tour, he was asked about Rayudu who retired from all forms of the sport after the snubs. He clarified that the selection committee was only making replacement changes based on the team management’s requirements and on that basis he didn’t find a place. There was no sort of bias in the decision-making and that they too got emotional as Rayudu retired.

The chairman of selectors also mentioned that they had brought Rayudu in the ODI team based on his T20I performance amidst criticism and gave him enough opportunities to cement a spot. Moving forward based on his performance and the combination of the team he couldn’t be included in the World Cup squad.
They persisted with him even after the middle-order batsman failed the yo-yo test. He was put on a fitness program at the NCA and they made sure he cleared it at the next go to be a part of the Indian team.
“There was criticism when we picked Rayudu after his 2017-18 T20 form. When he failed the fitness test, we backed him. Due to some combinations and permutations, we didn’t pick him for the World Cup. We didn’t do anything against him,” MSK said.
Rayudu’s 3D tweet got really popular and also proved to be meme material. The common perception was that the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) officials, the team management as well as the selectors were not happy with his tweet. The Hyderabadi was one of the few Indian players who ever questioned their selection or non-selection on social media or a public platform.
However, Prasad said that he saw humour in the tweet and really enjoyed the sarcasm in it since it was timely.
“Ambati Rayudu tweet was lovely. I enjoyed it. That was sarcasm… that was really good. It was timely tweet,” he stated.

Umpire who gave England 6 overthrows in WC final admits it was a mistake
Umpire Kumar Dharmasena has admitted that awarding England six overthrows instead of five in final over of 2019 World Cup final was a mistake. "I agree...there was a judgmental error when I see it on TV replays now. But we didn't have luxury of TV replays at the ground," he said. He further said that he'll never regret the decision.
https://www.crictracker.com/i-will-never-regret-the-decision-i-made-says-kumar-dharmasena-on-the-controversial-overthrow-in-the-world-cup-final/
CricTracker
It’s been a week since the 2019 World Cup final has finished but many are still busy discussing the game. Undoubtedly, it was the best ODI game ever played and irrespective of the result, both England and New Zealand should be proud of themselves for the effort they put in. But some crunch moments decided the game eventually and one of them was the umpire Kumar Dharmasena awarding six runs to England in the last over of the chase when the ball ricocheted off Ben Stokes’ bat.
The incident took place in the final over when the home team needed nine runs off three balls and the Kiwis almost had the World Cup trophy in the bag. The batsman swatted the ball to deep mid-wicket and set off for two runs. While taking the second run, Stokes dived to avoid getting run-out only for his bat to deflect the ball to the boundary.

The on-field umpires consulted then to give England six runs when actually five runs should’ve signalled. According to the cricketing laws, the two batsmen should’ve crossed each other when the fielder threw the ball and Stokes and Adil Rashid hadn’t crossed when Martin Guptill fired in a throw. It was considered as a clear mistake by the former international umpire Simon Taufel.
Speaking about the controversial call to a Sri Lankan publication the Sunday Times, Kumar Dharmasena has cleared that he has no regrets about the decision he made regarding the overthrow. However, he also admitted that they made a judgemental error in the middle.
“It’s easy for people to comment after seeing TV replays. I agree that there was a judgmental error when I see it on TV replays now. But we did not have the luxury of TV replays at the ground and I will never regret the decision I made. Besides, the ICC praised me for the decision I made at that time,” he said.
Dharmasena also cleared that he communicated to the leg umpire Marais Erasmus before making the decision and even the other umpires agreed to give six runs to England. “There is no provision in the law to refer this to the third umpire as no dismissal was involved. So, I did consult the leg umpire through the communication system which is heard by all other umpires and the match referee.
“And, while they cannot check TV replays, they all confirmed that the batsmen have completed the run. This is when I made my decision,” the 48-year-old added.

British finance minister says he will resign if Boris becomes PM
British finance minister Philip Hammond has said he will resign from the post if Boris Johnson becomes Prime Minister. "Assuming that Boris Johnson becomes Prime Minister, I understand that his conditions for serving in his government would include accepting a no-deal Brexit on the 31st of October. That is not something I could ever sign up to," Hammond added.
https://www.reuters.com/article/us-britain-eu-hammond/uk-finance-minister-hammond-to-resign-on-wednesday-over-no-deal-brexit-idUSKCN1UG0B4?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts
Reuters
LONDON (Reuters) - British finance minister Philip Hammond said on Sunday he would resign if Boris Johnson became prime minister because he felt unable to support a leader happy to take the country out of the European Union without a deal. 
Hammond’s decision underlines the strength of feeling in parliament against a no-deal Brexit, which some lawmakers and many businesses say would be catastrophic for the economy. 
A loyal Conservative who has served in a number of ministerial roles, Hammond is an unlikely rebel. He said his fears over a no deal forced him to vote against the government for the first time in his 22-year political career last week. 
Britain’s new prime minister is tipped to be former London mayor Johnson, who has promised to leave the EU “do or die” by an Oct. 31 deadline. That leaves him facing a tricky Brexit challenge from the moment he would take office on Wednesday. 
Johnson has said he would ramp up preparations for a no deal to try to force the EU’s negotiators to make changes to the agreement that Prime Minister Theresa May sealed with Brussels and UK lawmakers voted down three times.  
But parliamentary opposition to a no deal is growing and the EU is refusing to budge over that withdrawal agreement. 
“I am sure I am not going to be sacked because I am going to resign before we get to that point,” Hammond told the BBC’s Andrew Marr Show, adding he would resign to May before she tendered her own resignation to the Queen on Wednesday. 
“Assuming that Boris Johnson becomes prime minister, I understand that his conditions for serving in his government would include accepting a no-deal (EU) exit on the 31st of October. That is not something I could ever sign up to.” 
Johnson has said his most senior ministers “would have to be reconciled” with the possibility of a no-deal Brexit on Oct. 31, a departure he does not want to see happen, but one he says must be planned for to try to increase pressure on the EU. 
That stance means several more ministers who want to leave with a deal may seek to quit before facing the prospect of being sacked by Johnson. 
Justice minister David Gauke has indicated he will also step down on Wednesday, and some lawmakers say they expect more pro-EU Conservatives to leave their positions to hold talks in parliament to find a way to prevent a no deal. 
Keir Starmer, Brexit policy chief in the main opposition Labour Party, said on Twitter he respected Hammond’s decision. 
“I want to work with all those MPs (members of parliament) who, like me, want to ensure parliament can stop a disastrous no-deal exit,” Starmer said. 
Hammond’s intention to resign led Ian Blackford, the Westminster leader of the Scottish National Party, to predict that Johnson could become “the shortest serving prime minister in history”. 
Hammond, who according to sources close to Johnson often infuriated the former mayor who felt the finance minister was “talking Britain down”, said he did not believe his former colleague could win a deal with the EU by the deadline.  
He instead advised the new prime minister to ask the EU for a little longer if there were signs that the two sides could agree on a compromise position - something Johnson’s rival for the premiership, Jeremy Hunt, has said he is open to. 
But the EU has so far been steadfast in its view that it cannot open the withdrawal agreement, and Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney said both sides would be “in trouble” if the new prime minister was intent on tearing up the deal. 
He suggested the new leader could secure changes to the political declaration on future ties to get rid of the Northern Irish backstop - an insurance policy to avoid the return of a hard border between the British province and Ireland. 
“We hope that the backstop that many in the UK don’t seem to like can be avoided,” Coveney told the BBC. “(But) we are simply not going to move away from that withdrawal agreement.” 
Johnson and his supporters say the hardline stance is little more than a negotiating ploy. But if the standoff failed to be broken and a no deal Brexit was in the offing, Hammond would become a high-profile backer of attempts in parliament to stop a no deal. 
“Yes, (I will campaign) to stop no deal happening on Oct. 31 without the consent of parliament,” Hammond said. 
“I want to be a loyal supporter of the next Conservative government and if (it).. can deliver a negotiated Brexit deal that protects our economy then I will strongly support that government. And I hope I will be able to.”

Trinamool Congress supremo Mamata Banerjee has demanded return of ballot papers in place of Electronic Voting Machines (EVMs) and said electoral reforms are required in the country to save democracy and stop the use of black money during polls. Banerjee, the chief minister of West Bengal, also demanded state funding of elections.
“Do not forget that the EVMs were earlier used in England, France, Germany and America. But they have now stopped using them…. So why cannot we bring the ballot papers back?” she said.
During Sunday’s rally, she is expected to highlight issues like EVMs and electoral reforms. “Since 1995, I have been demanding electoral reforms. If we want to stop use of black money in elections, save democracy and let political parties maintain transparency, you must go for electoral reforms,” Banerjee told reporters here on Saturday.

State funding is necessary in such reforms, she said alleging that political parties use black money during polls.The TMC chief had earlier claimed that several crores of rupees were spent during the recently-held Lok Sabha elections. “Some are saying it amounts to thousands of crores. I want to know, where did all this money come from? Every party cannot spend so much money. This is corruption. Money was sent to different fake bank accounts. Money was transferred even using RTGS,” she said.

Agencies gave IL&FS good ratings despite stress flags: Audit
A Grant Thornton audit into debt-laden IL&FS Group revealed that rating agencies despite flagging financial stress before its default, continued to give it and its units "consistently high" credit ratings. It said officials of agencies, comprising ICRA, CRISIL, CARE, Brickwork and India Ratings, were possibly given gifts like smartwatches and overseas sports event tickets to influence the ratings.
https://in.reuters.com/article/india-il-fs-ratings/rating-agencies-knew-of-stress-at-ilfs-but-gave-good-ratings-audit-idINKCN1UG079?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts
Reuters
MUMBAI/NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Credit rating agencies for years assigned high ratings to India’s Infrastructure Leasing & Financial Services (IL&FS) and its group companies despite its deteriorating finances, according to a special audit. 
Audit firm Grant Thornton was appointed by IL&FS’ new board to conduct the review following the government’s decision to take charge of the group after its defaults on debt obligations sparked fears of financial contagion.  
Grant Thornton reviewed the role of five credit rating agencies — Fitch group’s India Ratings and Research, the Indian affiliate of Moody’s, ICRA, Standard & Poor’s local unit Crisil, CARE Ratings and Brickwork Ratings India — which assigned 429 ratings to various IL&FS financial instruments in recent years. 
In a 105-page report, reviewed by Reuters on Saturday, Grant Thornton said the agencies raised multiple concerns on IL&FS group’s financial stress and liquidity position between June 2012 and June 2018, but continued to assign “consistently high” ratings which were only downgraded or reversed last year. 
“Various strategies deployed by the then key officials of IL&FS group and certain favours/gifts provided to rating agency officials suggest the possible reasons for consistent good ratings provided to IL&FS group,” said Grant Thornton in its report that detailed gifts or favours such as smartwatches and tickets to overseas sporting events.  
IL&FS declined to comment. India Ratings said the Grant Thornton report is based on “partial and selective source material”, adding “our ratings were based on robust and transparent analysis of relevant information”. 
Brickwork said it did not assign the highest ratings to IL&FS “because it follows robust, transparent and consistent rating methodology” and its actions were not influenced by any commercial pressures or rating withdrawal requests. 
ICRA said it will determine an appropriate course of action and was examining the report, which it said ignores the “alleged fraud perpetrated by former IL&FS management”. 
Crisil and CARE did not immediately respond to a request for comment.     
The IL&FS crisis that started last year has sparked a series of federal probes into the firm’s operations, but Grant Thornton’s report raises questions on whether rating agencies misled investors about the stress levels at other companies in India’s shadow banking sector, where new fractures are emerging. 
Dewan Housing Finance Corp, another top firm in the sector, last week warned its financial situation was dire, raising more worries about the sector’s health and signalling the crisis was far from over. 
“These instances show a glimpse into the incestuous financial services industry where quid pro quo has become the norm. The rot ... is deep and needs more cleansing,” said Shriram Subramanian, a corporate governance expert at proxy advisory firm InGovern.  
Grant Thornton’s review of communication between former IL&FS employees and ratings agencies found the company at times “used to potentially pressurize” rating firms to withdraw their assessment if the company did not receive a favourable rating. 
It also found instances where credit rating agencies would meet with IL&FS employees and then decide not to downgrade the ratings they had initially decided on, the report said. 
“It appears that various potential strategies noted above were applied to ensure favorable ratings or to avoid the rating downgrade,” Grant Thornton said. 
Highlighting “potential favours/gifts”, Grant Thornton said various key officials at rating agencies received gifts such as smartwatches, shirts and coasters. 
E-mail communication showed a former IL&FS employee had facilitated the purchase of a villa at a steep discount for the wife of a senior Fitch executive, while another had arranged football tickets for a Brickwork Ratings executive to a Real Madrid game, the report added.  
Brickwork said it had shared “a detailed response” on this specific allegation with IL&FS’ new management. Fitch in a statement said the employee involved had violated the agency’s code of conduct and was no longer employed. 
India’s market regulator has toughened regulations for credit rating agencies over the past three years to boost monitoring and bring clarity for investors. Following the IL&FS crisis, the regulator last month ordered enhanced disclosure norms for such agencies.

Donald Trump becoming face of 'racism and exclusion': Siemens CEO
German multinational conglomerate Siemens' CEO Joe Kaeser took to Twitter and said US President Donald Trump is becoming the face of 'racism and exclusion'. "I lived in the USA for many years and experienced freedom, tolerance and openness as never before," Kaeser said. This comes after Trump asked four female Democratic lawmakers to "go back" to where they came from.

The Financial Express
Siemens AG Chief Executive Officer Joe Kaeser said President Donald Trump is turning into a symbol of racism after telling four female Democratic lawmakers to “go back” to where they came from. Kaeser, one of Germany’s most prominent business leaders, said on Twitter he finds it depressing “that the world’s most important political office is turning into the face of racism and exclusion.”
“I lived in the USA for many years and experienced freedom, tolerance and openness as never before,” said Kaeser, whose past jobs include a stint at a Siemens unit in San Jose, California.
Kaeser, 62, was replying to a sarcastic tweet by former German lawmaker Ruprecht Polenz, who said Germany might end up having to take Trump back. One of the president’s grandfathers emigrated to the U.S. in the 1880s.
Polenz, a member of Chancellor Angela Merkel’s Christian Democratic Union party, was commenting on Trump’s campaign rally in Greenville, North Carolina, on Wednesday where his supporters directed chants of “send her back” at Representative Ilhan Omar, a Somali-born U.S. citizen from Minnesota.
Trump attempted to distance himself from the chant, though he appeared to back off his disavowal on Friday.

Britain writes to UN after Iran seizes oil tanker, calls it 'illegal'
Britain has written to the UN Security Council after Iran seized a British-flagged oil tanker, saying the vessel was approached by Iranian forces when it was in Omani territorial waters. Britain said that Iran's action constitutes "illegal interference". "The ship was exercising the lawful right of transit passage in an international strait as provided for under international law," Britain wrote.

Reuters
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Britain told the United Nations Security Council on Saturday that a British-flagged tanker seized by Iran was approached by Iranian forces when it was in Omani territorial waters and the action “constitutes illegal interference.” 
“The ship was exercising the lawful right of transit passage in an international strait as provided for under international law,” Britain’s U.N. mission wrote to the Security Council. “International law requires that the right of transit passage shall not be impeded, and therefore the Iranian action constitutes illegal interference.” 
The letter, seen by Reuters, was also sent to U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres. 
Friday’s action in the global oil trade’s most important waterway has been viewed in the West as a major escalation after three months of confrontation that has already taken Iran and the United States to the brink of war. 
It follows threats from Tehran to retaliate for Britain’s seizure on July 4 of the Iranian tanker Grace 1, accused of violating sanctions on Syria. 
“Current tensions are extremely concerning, and our priority is to de-escalate. We do not seek confrontation with Iran,” the letter read. “But it is unacceptable and highly escalatory to threaten shipping going about its legitimate business through internationally recognized transit corridors.” 
Britain called on Iran to release the Stena Impero tanker and told the Security Council it was working to resolve the issue through diplomatic means.

Iran releases video of British-flagged oil tanker's capture
Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps has released a video showing British-flagged oil tanker Stena Impero's capture. The video shows speedboats pulling up alongside the tanker, and troops wearing ski masks and carrying machine guns being lowered onto its deck from a helicopter. The same tactics were used by British Royal Marines to seize an Iranian oil tanker two weeks ago.

Reuters
GENEVA/LONDON (Reuters) - Britain on Saturday denounced Iran’s seizure of a British-flagged oil tanker in the Gulf as a “hostile act” and rejected Tehran’s explanation that it seized the vessel because it had been involved in an accident. 
Iran’s Revolutionary Guards posted a video online showing speedboats pulling alongside the Stena Impero tanker, its name clearly visible. Troops wearing ski masks and carrying machine guns rappelled to its deck from a helicopter, the same tactics used by British Royal Marines to seize an Iranian tanker off the coast of Gibraltar two weeks ago. 
Friday’s action in the global oil trade’s most important waterway has been viewed in the West as a major escalation after three months of confrontation that has already taken Iran and the United States to the brink of war. 
It follows threats from Tehran to retaliate for Britain’s July 4 seizure of the Iranian tanker Grace 1, accused of violating sanctions on Syria. 
British Defence Secretary Penny Mordaunt called the incident a “hostile act”. Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt said he had expressed “extreme disappointment” by phone to his Iranian counterpart, Mohammad Javad Zarif. Britain also summoned the Iranian charge d’affaires in London. 
A spokesman for Iran’s Revolutionary Guards, Brigadier-General Ramezan Sharif, said Tehran had seized the ship in the Strait of Hormuz despite the “resistance and interference” of a British warship which had been escorting it. No British warship was visible in the video posted by the Guards. 
Iran’s Fars news agency said the Guards had taken control of the Stena Impero on Friday after it collided with an Iranian fishing boat whose distress call it ignored. 
The vessel, carrying no cargo, was taken to the Iranian port of Bandar Abbas. It will remain there with its 23 crew - 18 of them Indians - while the accident is investigated, Iranian news agencies quoted the head of Ports and Maritime Organisation in southern Hormozgan province, Allahmorad Afifipour, as saying. 
In a letter to the U.N. Security Council, Britain said the tanker was approached by Iranian forces when it was in Omani territorial waters exercising its lawful right of passage, and the action “constitutes illegal interference.” 
“Current tensions are extremely concerning, and our priority is to de-escalate. We do not seek confrontation with Iran,” the letter said. “But it is unacceptable and highly escalatory to threaten shipping going about its legitimate business through internationally recognized transit corridors.” 
Zarif told Hunt that the ship must go through a legal process before it can be released, Iran’s ISNA news agency reported. 
The strait, between Iran and the Arabian peninsula, is the sole outlet for exports of most Middle Eastern oil, and the seizure sent oil prices sharply higher. The United States, which tightened sanctions against Iran in May with the aim of halting its oil exports altogether, has been warning for months of an Iranian threat to shipping in the strait. 
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said he also discussed the situation with Hunt, his British counterpart. 
“We talked about what they’ve seen, what they know, and how they’re beginning to think about how they will respond,” Pompeo said in an interview with the Washington Examiner that was published on Saturday by the State Department. “Iran is in a place today that they have taken themselves.” 
Another oil tanker, the Mesdar, was also boarded by Iranian personnel on Friday and temporarily forced to divert toward Iran, but later was allowed to continue on its route through the strait. On Saturday Algeria’s APS news agency said the Mesdar was owned by Algeria’s state oil company Sonatrach. 
France, Germany and the European Union joined Britain in condemning the seizure. 
The three big European countries are signatories to a 2015 nuclear deal between Tehran and world powers that Washington undermined by quitting last year, setting Iran’s already fragile relations with the West on a downward spiral. 
Under the pact, Iran agreed to restrict nuclear work in return for lifting sanctions. The European countries opposed the Trump administration’s decision to abandon the agreement last year, but have so far failed to fulfill promises to Iran of providing alternative means for it to access world trade. 
“Just spoke to ... Zarif and expressed extreme disappointment that having assured me last Saturday Iran wanted to de-escalate situation, they have behaved in the opposite way,” Hunt wrote on Twitter. “This has to be about actions not words if we are to find a way through.”  
Earlier he said London’s reaction would be “considered but robust” and it would ensure the safety of its shipping. 
On Friday, Hunt said the solution would be found via diplomacy and London was “not looking at military options.” Britain’s government said it had advised British shipping to stay out of the Hormuz area for an interim period. 
During the past three months of escalation, the United States and Iran come as close as ever to direct armed conflict. In June, Tehran shot down a U.S. drone and President Donald Trump ordered retaliatory air strikes, only to call them off just minutes before were to have been carried out. 
The vessel had been heading to a port in Saudi Arabia and suddenly changed course after passing through the strait. 
The United States has blamed Iran for a series of attacks on shipping around the Strait of Hormuz. Tehran has rejected the allegations. Washington also said it had this week downed an Iranian drone near where the Stena Impero was seized.  
The United States is sending military personnel and resources to Saudi Arabia for the first time since the U.S. invasion of Iraq in 2003.

7 killed as suicide bomber strikes hospital in Pakistan
A suicide bomber, believed to be a woman, killed at least 7 people and wounded several others in an attack outside a local civilian hospital in Pakistan on Sunday. Officials said the blast had damaged the emergency ward of the hospital. The attack in Dera Ismail Khan was claimed by Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan, also known as the Pakistan Taliban.

Reuters
DERA ISMAIL KHAN, Pakistan (Reuters) - A female suicide bomber in northwestern Pakistan killed at least eight people and wounded 26 more in an attack outside a local civilian hospital on Sunday, local officials said. 
The attack in Dera Ismail Khan early on Sunday was claimed by Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan, often known as the Pakistani Taliban, which is separate from the insurgent movement across the border in Afghanistan. 
Local officials said the attack happened after two police were killed at a roadside checkpoint outside the city. 
“When their bodies were taken to the main hospital, a suicide bomber, believed to be a female, wearing a burqa, triggered an explosive-laden jacket and caused huge losses,” said Waqar Ahmad, a local police officer. 
He said the blast had damaged the emergency ward of the hospital and forced some of the wounded to be transferred to other cities. 
Muhammed Khurasani, a spokesman for the TTP, claimed responsibility for the attack, which he said was carried out in revenge for the killing of two Taliban commanders by counter terrorism police around a month ago. However he denied the bomber was female. 
Dera Ismail Khan has seen a number of suicide attacks over the past decade as the Pakistani military carried out a campaign to suppress militant attacks in the area, an important hub in the $60 billion China Pakistan Economic Corridor.

US-S Korea military exercise to proceed despite N Korea's warning
The secretary for peace planning to South Korean President Moon Jae-in, Jong Kun Choi, has said a US-South Korean military exercise would go ahead as planned next month. This comes despite North Korea's warning that the exercise will put talks aimed at getting the country to abandon its nuclear weapons at risk. "The nature of exercise isn't offensive," Choi said.
https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-southkorea-military/u-s-south-korean-military-exercise-to-proceed-top-south-korean-official-idUSKCN1UF0OV?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts
Reuters
ASPEN, Colo. (Reuters) - A top South Korean official on Saturday said a U.S.-South Korean military exercise would go ahead as planned next month, denying Pyongyang’s charges that holding it would breach an agreement made between U.S. President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. 
“The nature of the exercise is not offensive ... and is for strengthening the alliance,” Choi Jong-kun, the secretary for peace planning to South Korean President Moon Jae-in, told the Aspen Institute’s annual strategic forum. 
Later, speaking with Reuters, Choi said next month’s exercise would largely involve computer simulations and not troops in the field. 
The spokesman for North Korea’s Foreign Ministry said on Tuesday that Trump had reaffirmed in a meeting with Kim last month that joint exercises would be halted adding that the U.S. decision to proceed with them was “clearly a breach” of the leaders’ agreements made at a summit in Singapore last year. 
The spokesman said proceeding with war games was jeopardizing Pyongyang’s resumption of nuclear talks with the United States. The ministry said Washington’s pattern of “unilaterally reneging on its commitments” was leading Pyongyang to its commitment to discontinue tests of nuclear weapons and intercontinental ballistic missiles. 
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo rejected the North Korean charges earlier this week. 
Speaking to the Aspen conference, Choi said that the United States would have consulted with his government had Trump agreed to suspend U.S.-South Korean war games during his talks last month with Kim on the border last month. 
“As far as I know, President Trump did not promise the cancellation of this upcoming military exercise,” said Choi. “If he had done that ... we would have been consulted and organized it and used it very strategically.” 
He noted that the United States and South Korea had suspended a large-scale exercise and canceled a second following the Singapore summit in June 2018 at which Trump sought to persuade Kim to end the development of nuclear weapons and eliminate his arsenal.  
A second Trump-Kim summit in February failed to make any headway. The following month, the U.S. and South Korean militaries announced they were scaling back major war games - which Pyongyang long has denounced as preparations for war - and would hold smaller-scale exercises. 
Even so, Choi said, the preparedness of the U.S. and South Korean military to operate together had not been waned. 
“For the record, military interoperability has never been compromised,” he said.

On the other hand, Rajesh Lilothia was given the responsibility for North Delhi Municipal Corporation, South Delhi Municipal Corporation, and Youth Congress and DPCC.Before that, Chacko had written to Dikshit expressing his discontentment in a letter over her appointing 14 District Congress Committee observers and 280 Block Congress Committee observers without consulting him and the working presidents of the party's city unit.Dikshit had on June 28 dissolved all 280 Block Congress Committees in the city with immediate effect, a decision which was later stayed by Chacko. This had led to a precarious situation within the party here. (ANI)

Man who set fire to Japan studio played games non-stop: Neighbour
The 41-year-old who set fire to a Japan animation studio, killing 34, lived alone in his apartment where he played games non-stop, according to his neighbour. He added music from video games blasted from Shinji Aoba's apartment at all hours. "I've never seen him go out during the day...I would regularly hear him go out around midnight," the neighbour added.
https://in.reuters.com/article/japan-fire-suspect-idINKCN1UF0D8?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=5d3341adb9415600019b1334&utm_source=inshorts
Reuters
OMIYA, Japan (Reuters) - The man suspected of killing 34 people in an arson attack in Japan lived alone, hundreds of kilometres from the torched Kyoto Animation studio, where he played video games non-stop and had “terrified” his neighbour just days earlier. 
Police late on Saturday issued an arrest warrant for 41-year-old Shinji Aoba, suspected of causing Japan’s worst mass killing in two decades on Thursday when he went to the studio in western Japan, poured fuel around the entrance and shouted “Die” as he set the building ablaze, according to public broadcaster NHK. 
They plan to arrest Aoba, who suffered serious burns and on Saturday was airlifted to a university hospital for treatment, once he recovers, NHK said.  
Police said Aoba had previously been convicted of robbing a shop. 
Aoba lived alone on the ground floor of a two-floor apartment building on the outskirts of Omiya, a commuter suburb of Tokyo and some 500 km (310 miles) east of Kyoto. His next-door neighbour recalled Aoba as pudgy and unkempt, with blemished skin. He kept odd hours and barely spoke to anyone.  
“I’ve never seen him go out during the day, not even to the convenience store. I would regularly hear him go out around midnight,” the neighbour, a 27-year-old man who declined to be identified, told Reuters. 
Music from video games blared from Aoba’s apartment at all hours, the neighbour said, adding that there had been complaints from residents about the noise in the last year. 
On July 14, days before the attack, Aoba grabbed and threatened the neighbour over an apparent misunderstanding. It started when Aoba began pounding on the wall to complain about noise, the neighbour said. 
When the neighbour went to Aoba’s front door to tell him the noise was coming from another unit, he heard a loud wail inside the apartment and then the door opened. 
“When he came out of his apartment, his eyes were bloodshot, and he started yelling at me to my face to shut up,” the neighbour said. 
“He grabbed me by the collar and started pulling my hair. It was terrifying.” 
After the Kyoto attack, Aoba told police he had done it because the studio had plagiarised his novel, Kyodo news reported. Kyoto Animation is well known in Japan and abroad for its series and movies, including “Violet Evergarden”, which has been on Netflix.  
Aoba had lived in the Omiya apartment for about three years, the neighbour said. Japanese media said he had moved into it at some point following his release from his prison for robbing a convenience store east of Tokyo in 2012. He had also received care for mental illness, NHK said. 
The apartment block is typical of the prefab apartments that crowd Japanese commuter suburbs: small, identical units, built with thin walls. Single air conditioners rest on narrow balconies outside each unit. The apartments are usually meant for single occupants and are popular with lower-income and younger workers.   
Residents in the area - a rural subdivision off a busy road where recently built homes and unkempt vegetable patches fight for space with a tiny cemetery - said they were shocked by the news of the arson. 
“I’ve lived here all my life, and until very recently, this area has never had any incidents of violence, or talk of violent people living in the neighbourhood,” said an engineer in his 20s en route to visit his parents who live near Aoba’s apartment. 
“It’s unsettling.”

Indian utilities' coal imports in 2019 first half rise over 53%
Coal imports by Indian coal utilities during the first half of 2019 rose 53.4% from a year earlier to 35.47 million tonnes, government data showed. Imports for power plants at Gujarat's Mundra made up 42% of all imports by Indian utilities during the first six months. Imports by Adani Power's Mundra plant more than quadrupled to 9.01 million tonnes.

Reuters
NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Coal imports by Indian coal utilities during the first half of 2019 rose 53.4% from a year earlier to 35.47 million tonnes, data provided by India’s Central Electricity Authority (CEA) showed. 
Demand for seaborne coal imports in India has risen because of a fast rising population and the unavailability of alternative fuels such as natural gas. 
Imports for power plants at the port of Mundra, in western India’s state of Gujarat, made up 42% of all imports by Indian utilities during the first half of 2019. 
Imports by Adani Power Ltd’s  Mundra plant more than quadrupled from a year earlier to 9.01 million tonnes, while coal shipments by Tata Power Ltd’s utility rose over 6% to 6.07 million tonnes. 
The utilities have been ramping up imports of thermal coal after India’s top court in October eased their earlier stance and paved the way for passing on increased generation costs to consumers. 
The power plants were forced to cut imports and slash electricity generation after the court barred them from increasing prices for customers in 2016, after their coal supplier Indonesia raised the price of coal. 
NTPC Ltd, India’s largest electricity generator, shipped in 1.4 million tonnes of coal to various ports during six months ended June 2019, about 11 times of what it imported a year ago. 
Coal is among the top five commodities imported by India, and about three-fifths of its thermal coal imports come from Indonesia, while less than one-sixth is imported from South Africa. 
Thermal coal imports rose at the fastest pace in four years in 2018, after two straight years of decline. 
Indian utilities are importing more as the government has failed to open the industry to competition because bureaucratic indecision and resistance from unions has stalled the passage of a liberalization policy approved by the country’s cabinet 16 months ago. 
Higher Indian coal imports are a boon for international miners such as Indonesia’s Adaro Energy, U.S. coal miner Peabody Energy Corp and global commodity merchants such as Glencore PLC. 
They also undercut efforts by Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government to cut imports and place additional burdens on India’s debt-ridden thermal power sector.

Google to pay $11 mn to settle job seekers' age-bias claims
Technology giant Google has agreed to pay $11 million to settle a class-action lawsuit which accused it of age bias and discrimination against old-age applicants. The lawsuit had claimed the offers discriminated by an average payout of more than $35,000 for 227 people. Google said the applicants were found to be "Googley" enough but lacked required technical skills.

The Financial Express
Google agreed to pay $11 million to end a lawsuit accusing the internet giant of discriminating against older job applicants, a deal that amounts to an average payout of more than $35,000 for 227 people who joined the class action.
The settlement also calls for the Alphabet Inc. unit to train employees and managers about age bias, to create a committee focused on age diversity in recruiting and to ensure that complaints are adequately investigated.
Lawyers for the company and attorneys representing the over-40 job seekers who sued submitted a final settlement proposal Friday to a federal judge in San Jose, California. Lawyers will collect about $2.75 million from the accord.
The case was brought by a woman who claimed she was interviewed by Google four times over seven years and was never offered employment despite her “highly pertinent qualifications and programming experience” because of her age. Cheryl Fillekes accused the company of “a systematic pattern and practice of discriminating” against older people.
“Age discrimination is an issue that needs to be addressed in the tech industry, and we’re very pleased that we were able to obtain a fair settlement for our clients in this case,” Daniel Low, a lawyer for Fillekes, said in an email.
Google denied the allegations, saying that Fillekes and other job seekers she cited as examples didn’t demonstrate the technical aptitude required for the job, even though they were found by staff interviewers to be “Googley” enough to be a good fit for the company.
The company said it still denies that it intentionally discriminated against Fillekes, or any of the other plaintiffs, because of their age. It says it has strong policies in place against discrimination, including age discrimination.
The case is Heath v. Google Inc., 15-cv-01824, U.S. District Court, Northern District of California (San Jose).

Addressed to Dikshit’s son Sandeep and daughter Latika, Gandhi, in her letter said that late Congress leader brought “grace, humanity, wisdom, and excellence to everything she did.”
“I write to you with my heart filled with grief and a great sense of loss, for your beloved mother occupied a huge space in it,” Gandhi wrote. Furthermore, she spoke of her husband and late PM Rajiv Gandhi’s regard for Dikshit and even developed a close relationship with her.
“I came to share my husband’s regard for Sheila ji and to value her very special gifts as I developed my own close relationship with her,” the letter read.

Recalling her memories with Dikshit, Gandhi said they had worked closely together during the years she was Chief Minister of Delhi, the state Congress chief and Secretary of the Indira Gandhi Memorial Trust.
Gandhi also showered praise on Dikshit for her ‘tremendous achievement’ and ‘dedication’ to tranform the national capital. “She worked with such vision and dedication to transform Delhi, to make it a much better place to live in for all its citizens, including the poorest, and that tremendous achievement remains her lasting legacy,” Gandhi noted.

The UPA chairperson added,”She (Sheila Dikshit) brought grace, humanity, wisdom and excellence to everything she did. And with what courage and loyalty she served the Congress party, till the end! I pray that you find the strength to bear your loss.”
Last night, Gandhi had visited Dikshit’s residence to pay her tributes. Her body has been kept at her residence in Delhi’s Nizamuddin. Gandhi also met the deceased’s sister Rama Dikshit and expressed her condolences.
Dikshit, a three-time Delhi Chief Minister (1998-2013), passed away on Saturday afternoon following a cardiac arrest at Fortis hospital. She was 81.

Masayoshi Son-led Japanese conglomerate SoftBank's Seoul venture capital unit, focusing on early-stage investments, has raised a fund worth about $270 million.

Reuters
TOKYO (Reuters) - SoftBank Group Corp said on Friday its Seoul-based venture capital unit focusing on early-stage investments has raised a 317 billion won ($270 million) fund.  
SoftBank Ventures Asia’s new fund will invest in early-stage startups globally with a focus on Asia, the tech conglomerate said.  
The new fund, which aims to close in the next six months with investors including South Korea’s National Pension Service, reflects a renewed appetite by SoftBank for early-stage investing. 
While SoftBank’s Saudi-backed, $100 billion Vision Fund bestrides the investing scene for late-stage startups, the group’s Chief Operating Officer Marcelo Claure in March launched a $5 billion, Latin American-focused fund. 
Previous investments by SoftBank Ventures Asia, which was established in 2000 before its remit was expanded earlier this year, include South Korean gaming company Nexon Co, which made its trading debut in Japan in 2011, and Indonesian e-commerce firm Tokopedia.

A Delhi restaurateur has filed a criminal defamation complaint against Bollywood actor Esha Gupta after she accused him of sexual misconduct through a series of posts on social media, on 5 July.
The Delhi-based businessman filed the defamation case through advocate Vikas Pahwa under IPC sections 499 and 500 in Saket Court, New Delhi. The matter has been posted for hearing on 28 August.
“The mental agony caused to the complainant is continuing every day since close friends and colleagues are contacting him and his family on a continuous basis and expressing displeasure over the content posted by the accused. Many members of the public have been expressing doubts on the integrity and moral character of the complainant believing the false and defamatory statements to be true,” the plea filed by Pahwa read.
Recenty, Esha, through a series of Tweets had accused Delhi-based restaurateur Rohit Vig of making her “uncomfortable” by staring at her all night.
“If a woman like me can feel violated and unsafe in the county, then idk what girls around feel. Even with two securities around I felt getting raped.. #RohitVig you’re a swine.. he deserves to rot,” she wrote.

Cricket is not a sport, says Russian government
The Russian government has refused to officially recognise cricket as a sport. Cricket will not be eligible for support from the Russian Sports Ministry, as per a memo. Footgolf, sports yoga, model plane flying, ice stock sport and korfball are among the disciplines that have found a place in Russia's "registry of sports". Thai boxing has also been denied recognition.

Cricket mania recently gripped the world as the ICC Cricket World Cup 2019, as England clinched a dramatic world crown after a nail biting final against New Zealand, winning on a 'Super Over' after the scores were tied in the match.
It seems the summer's cricket love-in hasn't spread as far as Russia, where the country's Sports Ministry has refused to grant sport status to the game.
"This time we didn't fully prepare the documents, there were some technical issues. We need to open more regional affiliations. Right now there are around 20, and we need 48," Moscow Cricket Federation member Aleskandr Sokorin said.
"Over the next year, we plan to open the remaining regional affiliations and again send an application. Right now they haven't recognized us because of this technicality, but next year everything should be fine."
The decision came as a surprise, owing to the fact other peculiar sports such as footgolf, sports yoga, model plane flying, capoeira, darts hold recognition. Also denied recognition as a sport in Russia was Muay Thai, also known as Thai boxing.
Cricket is watched by nearly a third of the world's population but has struggled to expand its fan base past cricket-mad regions such as South Asia, Australasia and the Caribbean, as well as Great Britain.
It was recognized a sport by the International Olympic Committe (IOC) in 2009, having featured in the Games in 1900 and 1904.

India may engage foreign lenders for loans to small firms
The government is reportedly in talks with foreign lenders to provide as much as ₹1 lakh crore in credit to the country's small enterprises. It is in discussions with multiple foreign lenders, including Germany's state-owned development bank KfW Group, the World Bank and some Canadian institutions. World Bank has said the discussions with the government were in the early stages.
https://in.reuters.com/article/india-economy-loans/exclusive-indian-government-seeks-to-tap-foreign-lenders-for-loans-to-its-small-firms-sources-idINKCN1UF06P?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts
Reuters
NEW DELHI (Reuters) - The government is in talks with foreign lenders to provide as much as $14.5 billion in credit to millions of its small firms, two officials said, in a sign the country’s banking system may not be robust enough to do the job on its own. 
The government is in discussions with multiple foreign lenders, including Germany’s state-owned development bank KfW Group, the World Bank and some Canadian institutions to extend lines of credit to small enterprises, one of the officials, who did not want to be identified, told Reuters. 
KfW’s India office confirmed the discussions, though the main focus was on credit lines to support small businesses’ solar power generation. The talks were at an early stage, KfW said. 
A spokesman for World Bank in India on Saturday said the discussions with the government were in the early stages, adding that “further rounds of consultations will help us define the contours of this collaboration”. 
The official said the government plans to source up to 1 trillion Indian rupees of loans from foreign institutions because Indian banks were not in a position to provide enough capital for the small business sector, which is seen as critical to job creation. 
“We are exploring, we are having discussions with various funding agencies if something can be done (for small and medium firms),” the second official said. 
The officials did not provide full details of the discussions they are having with banks, or identify all those they are talking to, but said talks are at a very early stage. 
India’s micro, small and medium enterprise (MSME) ministry is discussing the proposal to pull in foreign banks with the country’s ministry of finance, which will make a final call, the second official said. 
The push for foreign loans comes on the heels of the Indian government’s announcement earlier this month that it plans to borrow about 700 billion rupees by issuing overseas sovereign bonds. 
India’s 63 million firms in the micro, small and medium firm sector are responsible for more than a quarter of the country’s manufacturing and services output, and must be re-energised for Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government to kick-start the economy.  
Gross domestic product growth fell to a five-year low of 5.8% in the January-March quarter, well below the 8%-plus rates that the government is targeting. 
But credit availability for small and medium firms, which also account for about 45% of India’s total exports, has worsened due to a liquidity crisis in the country’s shadow banking industry that has seen big lenders struggling to remain solvent.   
State-owned banks, which dominate the sector, have not been able to drive increased lending because they are burdened with more than $145 billion in bad loans. 
This has led to a severe credit squeeze for smaller firms. They pay up to 17% annual interest on loans from banks, while the shadow banks, which are also known as non-banking financial companies (NBFCS) can charge as much as 20%. 
Last month, a study by a Reserve Bank of India panel said the overall deficit in credit for the MSME sector is estimated at about 20 trillion rupees to 25 trillion rupees.     
But lending to such firms can be risky as some lack proper financial information, such as historical cash flow data, which makes it challenging for banks to assess the credit risks. 
To mitigate such risks for foreign banks, the loans would be given sovereign guarantees and be routed through Indian government agencies such as the Small Industries Development Bank of India, the first official said.

PM's Economic Advisory Council argued that Subramanian overlooked taxation data in his earlier analysis. In a follow-up paper, he argued real growth in direct taxes fell from 14.3% pre-2011 to 3.7% during the post-2011 period.

Insolvency administrator invites resolution plans for Jet Airways
Jet Airways resolution professional, Grant Thornton's Ashish Chhawchharia, has invited Expressions of Interest (EoIs) for the grounded airline by August 3. The final list of prospective applicants will be issued on August 14 and the resolution plans have to be submitted by September 5. Almost 17,000 creditors of the carrier have claimed ₹24,890 crore in dues.
https://www.financialexpress.com/industry/jet-airways-insolvency-administrator-invites-resolution/1650677/?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts
The Financial Express
The insolvency administrator of Jet Airways India Ltd. is seeking resolution proposals for the grounded airline in a move that may give hope to creditors including State Bank of India.
Any expression of interest has to be submitted by Aug. 3, Ashish Chhawchharia, resolution professional, said in a notice published in the Economic Times newspaper on Saturday. The final list of prospective applicants will be issued on Aug. 14 and the resolution plans have to be submitted by Sept. 5, it said.
The step to seek resolution proposals may give creditors a chance to recover some of their dues. Last month the National Company Law Tribunal agreed to hear an insolvency case and once Jet Airways is declared bankrupt the chances of any meaningful recovery by the banks diminish.
The carrier, once the nation’s biggest by market value, hasn’t flown since April after running out of cash. Jet Airways, which successfully took on the monopoly of state-run Air India Ltd. in the early 1990s, fell victim to a cut-throat price war initiated by a slew of budget carriers and eventually defaulted to banks, staff and lessors.
Almost 17,000 creditors of the carrier, including its former chief executive officer, have claimed 248.9 billion rupees ($3.6 billion) in dues. Most of Jet’s employees, including the chief executive officer and the chief financial officer, and hundreds of pilots and crew, have already left the company. Abu Dhabi’s Etihad Airways PJSC owns 24% of the carrier.
Banks have held talks with several potential investors, from Etihad Airways PJSC to Indian conglomerate Tata Group, without any success. Etihad was the only bidder in an auction process, but its offer was conditional on another investor pumping in most of the required cash. Some of Etihad’s conditions can only be met through a bankruptcy process, by allowing it to sidestep certain securities regulations, the lenders have said.

Fake FaceApp challenge apps putting malware on devices: Kaspersky
Cybersecurity firm Kaspersky has revealed fake clones of viral photo-editing app FaceApp, that lets users virtually look older, is installing malware such as 'MobiDash' adware on users' devices. Kaspersky added about 500 different users have faced the issue in two days, after first noticing the same on July 7. About 800 modifications of the 'MobiDash' module were identified, it added.

ANI
New Delhi (India), July 19 (ANI): Global cybersecurity company Kaspersky Lab has revealed the risk of using apps that allows a person to age their face, which is also the latest viral craze on the social media.The company found that a fake app that is designed to trick users into thinking it is a certified version of FaceApp can actually infect victims' devices with an adware module called MobiDash.They further revealed that once the application is downloaded from unofficial sources and installed, it simulates a failure and is subsequently removed. After that, a malicious module in the application rests discreetly on the user's device, displaying adverts.According to Kaspersky data, around 500 unique users have encountered the problem in the last two days, with the first detections appearing on July 7. There were almost 800 different module modifications identified."The people behind MobiDash often hide their adware module under the guise of popular applications and services. This means that the activities of the fake version of FaceApp could intensify, especially if we are talking about hundreds of targets in just a few days. We urge users not to download applications from unofficial sources and to install security solutions on their devices to avoid any damage," noted Igor Golovin, security researcher at Kaspersky.The company's previous study uncovered that the majority (63 per cent) of consumers do not read license agreements and 43 per cent just tick all privacy permissions when they are installing new apps. While this survey was done three years ago, they believe its findings on digital habits remain relevant and true. (ANI)

Chrome, Firefox users' data leaked, for sale at ₹700: Researcher
Extensions on Chrome and Firefox internet browsers leaked millions of users' data, including medical, credit card and tax returns information, cyber-security researcher Sam Jadali revealed. The data was leaked to a fee-based company Nacho Analytics, which gives unlimited access to any websites' analytics data, Jadali said. The data was reportedly put on sale for as little as $10 (nearly ₹700).

The News Minute
Popular browser extensions like ad blockers have been caught harvesting personal data of millions of consumers who use Chrome and Firefox -- not only their browsing histories but also exposing tax returns, medical records, credit card information and other sensitive data in the public domain.
According to an independent cyber security researcher Sam Jadali, the data has been leaked to a fee-based company called Nacho Analytics that gives unlimited access to any websites analytics data.
The data could be purchased for as little as $10 to $50, said Jadali whose report was first described in Ars Technica late on Friday.
"This non-stop flow of sensitive data over the past seven months has resulted in the publication of links to home and business surveillance videos hosted on Nest and other security services.
"Tax returns, billing invoices, business documents, and presentation slides posted to, or hosted on, Microsoft OneDrive, Intuit.com, and other online services" have been exposed, said the report.
The exposed data via eight browser extensions also include vehicle identification, numbers of recently bought automobiles, along with the names and addresses of the buyers.
Patient details, travel itineraries, Facebook Messenger attachments and Facebook photos, even private, are now available in the public domain.
Browser extensions - also known as plug-ins or add-ons - are apps that consumers can install to run alongside their browser for additional functionality.
The affected extensions were apps used by millions of people, including HoverZoom, SpeakIt!, and FairShare Unlock.
"The extensions have been remotely removed or disabled in consumers' browsers and are no longer available for download," said both Google and Firefox.
People who didn't download the extensions may also be affected.
"Nobody is immune to this. Even if you don't have any harmful extensions, the other people you interact with may have an extension on their computers that could be leaking the data you share with them," Jadali was quoted as saying.
Nacho Analytics, for example, promises to let people "see anyone's analytics account" and to provide "real-time web analytics for any website".
The company charges $49 per month, per domain, to monitor any of the top 5,000 most widely-trafficked websites.
The security expert has suggested users to delete all browser extensions they have installed in the past.

Punjab CM Amarinder Singh accepts Navjot Singh Sidhu's resignation
Punjab Chief Minister Captain Amarinder Singh has accepted Navjot Singh Sidhu's resignation as a state minister. Sidhu had also sent his resignation letter dated June 10 to then-Congress President Rahul Gandhi. Punjab CM had divested Sidhu of the Local Government and Tourism and Cultural Affairs Departments and allotted him the Power and New and Renewable Energy Sources portfolios last month.
https://www.financialexpress.com/india-news/punjab-cm-amarinder-singh-accepts-navjot-singh-sidhus-resignation/1650703/?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts
The Financial Express
Days after Navjot Singh Sidhu resigned from the state cabinet, Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh Saturday accepted his “one-line” resignation. The chief minister has sent the resignation to Governor V P Singh Badnore for formal acceptance, an official spokesperson said here.
Amarinder, who had been indisposed for the last two days, since arrival from Delhi on Wednesday, saw the resignation letter Saturday morning, the spokesperson said.
The letter, however, was just a single sentence tendering Sidhu’s resignation, with no explanation or elaboration, he added.
Punjab chief minister accepted Sidhu’s resignation at a time when there were speculation in the media that the Congress high command intervened in the matter for the resolution of the issue between both the leaders.
The 55-year-old Sidhu, who has been at loggerheads with Amarinder, was stripped off key portfolios in the cabinet reshuffle on June 6. Punjab CM had divested Sidhu of the Local Government and Tourism and Cultural Affairs Departments and allotted him the power and new and renewable energy portfolio.
Notably, apart from Sidhu, the portfolios of other ministers were also changed.
The refusal to assume the charge of the power department by Sidhu for more than a month also came as an “embarrassment” to Congress with opposition parties attacking Amarinder-led regime in the state.
Cricketer-turned-politician took to his Twitter handle on July 14, making public his June 10 resignation letter from the state cabinet addressed to then Congress president Rahul Gandhi, which was sent just four days after his portfolio was changed.
On July 15, Sidhu has sent his resignation letter to Amarinder’s official residence here while CM was in Delhi.
Amarinder on Tuesday in Delhi had said that he would decide on Sidhu’s resignation after going through the contents of the resignation letter once he reached Chandigarh. Chief Minister returned to Chandigarh Wednesday evening.
Earlier this week, Amarinder in Delhi had said if Sidhu did not want to do his job, there was nothing he could do about it.
In the absence of Sidhu, Amarinder has been monitoring the functioning of the power department in the wake of ongoing crucial paddy sowing season and rising power demand during hot and humid weather conditions in the state.
Ever since the portfolio reshuffle exercise, Sidhu and his wife Navjot Kaur have been maintaining a distance from the media.
The tension between Punjab CM and Sidhu had come out in the open in May when Amarinder blamed Sidhu for the “inept handling” of the Local Government Department, claiming that it resulted in “poor performance” of the Congress in urban areas in the Lok Sabha polls.
The cricketer-turned-politician, however, had said his department was being “singled out publicly” while asserting that he could not be taken for granted as he had been a “performer throughout.”
Sidhu had even approached the then Congress president Rahul Gandhi on June 9 and had “apprised him of the situation” besides handing over a letter to him.
Sidhu, a former BJP leader who had joined the Congress just ahead of the 2017 Punjab assembly polls, has been at loggerheads with Amarinder for sometime now.
During Lok Sabha polls, Amarinder had taken umbrage at Sidhu’s “friendly match” jibe during electioneering in Bathinda on May 17. Sidhu had allegedly cornered the Congress government in the state over the issue of the desecration of religious texts, questioning why no FIR was lodged against the Badals, who ran the previous government in the state.
This had evoked sharp reaction from Amarinder. Hitting out at Sidhu, the chief minister had said, “If he was a real Congressman, he should have chosen a better time to air his grievances, instead of just ahead of voting in Punjab.”
“He is harming the party with such irresponsible actions. It is not his election but that of the entire Congress,” he had said. “Perhaps he is ambitious and wants to be the chief minister,” Amarinder had said.
Earlier also, the tension between Amarinder and Sidhu had come out in the public. Last year, Sidhu had said in Hyderabad, “(Congress chief) Rahul Gandhi is my captain…Rahul Gandhi is the captain of the captain (Amarinder) also.” Amarinder had also disapproved of Sidhu hugging the Pakistan Army chief during his visit to the neighbouring country.

Trump offers to help ease tensions in Japan-South Korea dispute
US President Donald Trump on Friday offered to help ease tensions in the political and economic dispute between Japan and South Korea. "It's like a full-time job getting involved with Japan and South Korea. But I like leaders of both the countries," Trump said. The dispute threatens global supplies of memory chips and smartphones.

Reuters
WASHINGTON/SEOUL (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump on Friday offered to help ease tensions in the political and economic dispute between Japan and South Korea, which threatens global supplies of memory chips and smartphones. 
Lingering tension, particularly over the issue of compensation for South Koreans forced to work for Japanese occupiers during World War Two, took a turn for the worse this month when Japan restricted exports of high-tech materials to South Korea. 
The United States has been hesitant to publicly wade into the feud between its two biggest allies in Asia. Trump said South Korean President Moon Jae-in had asked him if he could get involved. 
“He tells me that they have a lot of friction going on now with respect to trade, primarily with respect to trade. And Japan has some things that South Korea wants, and he asked me to get involved,” Trump told reporters at the White House. 
“So maybe if they would both want me to, I’ll be. It’s like a full-time job getting involved with Japan and South Korea. But I like both leaders.” 
South Korea’s presidential Blue House spokeswoman, Ko Min-jung, said in a statement on Saturday that Moon had asked Trump for help at their Seoul summit on June 30. 
Ko said Moon talked to Trump in an effort to diplomatically solve the issue as Japanese media, at the time, constantly reported the possibility of economic retaliation against South Korea.  
David Stilwell, the top U.S. diplomat for East Asia policy, said in Seoul on Wednesday that he took the situation seriously but did not elaborate on what steps Washington might take and said it was fundamentally up to South Korea and Japan to resolve their differences. 
Japan has denied that the dispute over compensation is behind the export curbs, even though one of its ministers cited broken trust with South Korea over the labor dispute in announcing the restrictions. 
Instead, Japan has cited “inadequate management” of sensitive items exported to South Korea, with Japanese media reporting some items ended up in North Korea. 
South Korea has denied that. 
The export curbs could hurt global technology companies.

Taj Mahal security to be raised after Sena's 'aarti' threat
Agra's district administration has agreed to increase security outside Taj Mahal after Shiv Sena's threat of performing 'aarti' at the monument on every Monday of the month of 'Sawan'. ASI authorities had requested more security, citing the Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Sites and Remains Act which prevents any kind of religious practice and beginning of new tradition at protected monuments.
https://www.india.com/news/india/taj-mahal-security-to-be-stepped-up-after-shiv-sena-threatens-to-perfrom-aarti-3722346/?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts
India.com
New Delhi: The district administration of Agra has agreed to beef up security outside the Taj Mahal at the request of Archaeological Survey of India (ASI), following Shiv Sena’s threat of performing ‘aarti’ at the monument on each Monday of the holy month of ‘Sawan’.
The ASI authorities wrote a letter stating that under the provisions of the Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Sites and Remains Act, 1958 any kind of religious practice and beginning of a new tradition in the protected monument is against the rules of the Act.
Agra Shiv Sena President Veenu Lavania on July 17 challenged the district administration and police to stop him and his aides from offering ‘aarti’ at the Taj Mahal.
Lavania had said: “Taj Mahal is not a mausoleum but Tejo Mahalaya, a temple of Lord Shiva. We will perform ‘aarti’ at Tejo Mahalaya on every Monday of ‘Sawan’.”
The Superintending Archaeologist of ASI of Agra circle, Vasant Swarankar, said that no ‘aarti’ or ‘puja’ has ever been performed in the Taj Mahal.
“We have requested the district authorities to make proper security arrangements outside the Taj Mahal,” he said.
Additional District Magistrate (ADM) K.P. Singh said that no one would be allowed to disturb the law and order situation in the city. He said that proper arrangements would be made as per the ASI’s request.
This is not the first time when right-wing groups have attempted to create controversy over-performing ‘puja’ inside the Taj Mahal.
Last year, a group of women from right-wing organizations had performed ‘puja’ in the mosque inside the Taj Mahal to prove that the monument was originally a Shiv temple.
In 2008, a group of Shiv Sena activists had sneaked into the Taj Mahal and performed religious ritual of a parikrama with folded hands, and when the cops spotted and challenged them, they got into a scuffle, which led to their arrest by the police.
The Shiv Sena says that the 17th-century monument was built by Emperor Shah Jahan on an older Shiva temple called Tejo Mahalaya.

J'khand man held for smoking on plane, faces jail or ₹1L fine
A Jharkhand man was deplaned and arrested on Friday for allegedly smoking inside a plane lavatory and reportedly faces three months in jail or ₹1 lakh fine for the offence. The incident came to light when the smoke alarm inside the Ranchi-bound flight went off. The accused has not been charged under the non-bailable section for the offence so far.
https://www.financialexpress.com/india-news/smoking-in-indigo-flight-gets-jharkhand-man-arrested-could-face-jail-or-rs-1-lakh-fine/1650728/?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts
The Financial Express
A passenger from Jharkhand has been arrested for allegedly smoking in the lavatory of an IndiGo Airlines flight (6E 485). The man who was aboard the Ranchi-bound flight on Friday has been identified as Deepak Kumar Sharma who belongs to Jharkhand’s Hazaribagh is facing up to 3 months jail or Rs one lakh fine for the offence.
This has also put a question mark on the airport security arrangement wherein the accused passenger should not have been able to pass through with a matchbox or a cigarette lighter.
According to the police, the incident came to light when the smoke alarm inside the Airbus 320 aircraft which landed in Ranchi at around 2.30 pm went off, as per a report by the Hindustan Times. Sharma could possibly have to pay a penalty of up to Rs 1 lakh or spend up to three months in jail for putting the aircraft at risk, says the report.
As per Section 25 of the Aircraft Act, the operator or the owner and the pilot who is in command of every aircraft registered in the country shall display a notice in the aircraft at prominent place stating where and to what extent smoking is prohibited or permitted inside the premises. Smoking is prohibited in all parts of the aircraft and in its vicinity and no person shall smoke “anywhere in an aircraft during take-off, landing or refuelling or during a period in which a notice is temporarily displayed indicating that smoking is prohibited.”
At first, Sharma was detained by the Central Industrial Security Force (CISF), which is responsible for airport security. He was then taken to the airport police station where he was booked with relevant sections for smoking inside the aircraft, Senior Superintendent of Police, Patna, Garima Mallik told Hindustan Times.
However, while Sharma has not been charged with the non-bailable section for the offence, it is still being considered whether he should be. Senior police officials are considering the matter, reports say.

Benjamin Netanyahu becomes longest-serving Israeli PM
Benjamin Netanyahu has become Israel's longest-serving Prime Minister, surpassing the record set by the country's founding father and first leader David Ben-Gurion. As of Saturday, Netanyahu has spent 4,876 days – more than 13 years – in office. Netanyahu won his first election in 1996, becoming Israel's youngest-ever Prime Minister at the age of 46.
https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jul/20/benjamin-netanyahu-becomes-longest-serving-israeli-pm?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts
The Guardian
Benjamin Netanyahu has become Israel‘s longest-serving prime minister, snatching the title from the country’s founding father and first leader, David Ben-Gurion.
As of Saturday, the man referred to as King Bibi by both those who adore and detest him, has spent 4,867 days – more than 13 years – in office.
During the past two decades, the now-69-year-old former commando has repeatedly won elections on promises of making Israel secure and prosperous, while sidelining the Palestinians.
“He has convinced many voters that he is irreplaceable,” said Gideon Rahat, a political science professor at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem and senior fellow at the Israel Democracy Institute.
Despite passing the historic milestone, Netanyahu still needs to win a September election and survive three impending corruption cases to continue his long tenure.
His supporters claim Israel has never been richer, safer or more globally accepted, including by leaders of Arab states. Critics argue he has opened fissures in Israeli society, stigmatised minorities to win elections, crushed progressive and human rights activism and encouraged the rise of far-right politics into government.
In the latest election in April, he was accused of appealing to racist voters when he stated Israel was “not a state of all its citizens”, referring to the country’s minority population of Palestinian citizens. Netanyahu later made an election pact with a group of far-right extremists called Jewish Power.
In his party, the rightwing Likud, Netanyahu has remained at the top, even when it appeared scandals and crises might take him down.
“He is very talented at not letting any challenger grow within his party. Any person that looked even close to being popular was somehow kicked out or neutralised,” Rahat said. “Nobody was seen as a replacement for him.”
In 1996, Netanyahu became Israel’s youngest prime minister, running on a platform against flailing peace attempts, especially the Oslo accords that gave some limited autonomy to the Palestinians.
Under his leadership, control over Palestinian life has become entrenched. The military occupation of the West Bank is tightly managed, while Jewish settlement construction has spread, giving Netanyahu support from hawkish and pro-settler sections of society.
Orit Galili-Zucker, a political communications adviser who has worked with Netanyahu, said the prime minister had since made “no courageous decision on the Israeli-Arab conflict. Israel remained stuck and he personally profited from his zero progress.”
Netanyahu had also managed to stay in power for so long, she said, by not embarking on grand military campaigns that resulted in large numbers of Israeli casualties, such as the 2006 Lebanon war headed by his predecessor, Ehud Olmert.
And as a man who made his break in politics as an affable English-speaking Israeli diplomat, he had excelled, she said, in campaigning and using TV and social media to rally support.
Yet Netanyahu could see his extraordinary run in power cut short before the end of the year.
One month after appearing to win the election, he failed to form a coalition government. Rather than risk losing the premiership to another contender, he chose to push parliament to disband and force another national vote. Fresh polls are set for 17 September, the first time the country has held two elections in one year.
Famed for 11th-hour brinkmanship and daring political gambits, many expect Netanyahu to win. But even then, he faces possibly the biggest challenge of his political career to date: the prospect of three corruption indictments.
Just weeks after the election, he will be called to a pre-trial hearing. Israel’s attorney general has already recommended he be indicted.
One case involves allegations of receiving gifts, including cigars and champagne from international billionaires, allegedly in exchange for favours. In another, Netanyahu was accused of colluding with the country’s top-selling newspaper to hurt its competition in exchange for favourable coverage.
A third case involves allegations that Netanyahu offered incentives to the Israeli telecoms provider Bezeq in exchange for positive stories on a news website it owns.
Netanyahu has denied all accusations, dismissing them as a witch-hunt orchestrated by the media. He is not legally required to step down unless he is convicted and all his appeals are rejected.

Reuters
BUENOS AIRES (Reuters) - César Pelli, the Argentine designer behind the iconic Petronas Twin Towers in Malaysia, has died aged 92, state media and officials said on Friday, marking the passing of one of the contemporary architectural greats. 
Pelli, who grew up in Argentina and studied architecture at the University of Tucumán in the country’s far northwest, established himself as a visionary and educator, making a name for himself in the United States where his main studio was based. 
Argentina’s Telam state news agency reported his passing on Friday, as did the governor of Tucuman province, where Pelli grew up and spent his formative years. 
“With much regret we receive the sad news of the death of the great Architect César Pelli,” the region’s governor, Juan Manzur, said in a post on Twitter. “I want to convey my condolences to his whole family, his friends and his team.” 
“He was without doubt a creator and his legacy will endure forever in each of his works.” 
In 1977, Pelli became dean of Yale University’s School of Architecture and founded Cesar Pelli & Associates, according to a biography on the website of the New Haven, Connecticut-based studio, since renamed Pelli Clarke Pelli, which lists offices in New York, Abu Dhabi, San Francisco, Tokyo and Shanghai. 
Along with the Petronas Towers, at the time the tallest buildings in the world, Pelli’s famous works include the World Financial Center in New York, Canary Wharf Tower in London and renovation work on New York’s Museum of Modern Art. 
Reuters could not immediately reach his firm for comment. 
Argentine energy giant YPF, whose headquarters in Buenos Aires was designed by Pelli, said he had “left his mark with his magnificent works in Argentina and the world. 
“A true ambassador of Argentine talent. Until always maestro.”

Will work to free rapper A$AP Rocky from detention in Sweden: Trump
US President Donald Trump has said he'll be working to free rapper A$AP Rocky, who's in police custody in Sweden. "I'll be calling the very talented Prime Minister of Sweden to see what we can do about helping Rocky," Trump tweeted. The rapper, whose real name is Rakim Mayers, was arrested over his alleged involvement in a fight in Stockholm.

The Guardian
Donald Trump has said he is working to free the American rapper A$AP Rocky, who has been held in police custody in Sweden for weeks.
“I will be calling the very talented Prime Minister of Sweden to see what we can do about helping A$AP Rocky,” Trump tweeted from aboard Air Force One on Friday, and said he had just spoken with Kanye West about Rocky’s situation.
“So many people would like to see this quickly resolved!” Trump said.
Rocky, a platinum-selling, Grammy-nominated artist whose real name is Rakim Mayers, has been in police custody since early July as Swedish police investigate his alleged involvement in a fight in Stockholm that occurred before his appearance at a music festival. Videos published on social media appear to show a person being violently thrown onto the ground by Rocky. A defense lawyer has said he acted in self-defense.
Congressman Adriano Espaillat, of New York, has been pushing for the rapper’s release and has been in contact with the state department and the US embassy in Sweden. Rocky is originally from the neighborhood of Harlem in New York City.
The case has earned the attention of a slew of celebrities, including Sean “Diddy” Combs, Justin Bieber, Jada Pinkett Smith, Nicki Minaj and Post Malone.
Kim Kardashian West encouraged Trump to take action to free Rocky. Kardashian West has previously worked with the Trump administration on criminal justice reform issues.
One senior administration official, speaking to the Associated Press on condition of anonymity to outline private conversations, said Kardashian West had reached out to Trump’s son-in-law and senior adviser, Jared Kushner, whom she has worked with closely, to tell him about the situation on behalf of her husband, a supporter of the president.
Kushner then briefed Trump, according to the official, who said Trump felt the case was worth looking into and directed his secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, to see what could be done.
The state department said Friday that it was following the case but declined to provide details, citing privacy considerations. Providing assistance to US citizens detained abroad is one of the department’s most important functions, it said.
Kardashian West thanked Trump, Pompeo and Kushner via Twitter, along with “everyone involved with the efforts to Free ASAP Rocky & his two friends”.
“Your commitment to justice reform is so appreciated,” she wrote on Thursday.
Rocky’s lawyer, Slobodan Jovicic, told the Associated Press that his client was aware of the president’s comments and “is very thankful for everyone who has reached out to show their support”.
“It means a lot to him, but we are focused on the case that we have in front of us,” he added.
Trump did not mention Kardashian West or Kushner to reporters in the Oval Office on Friday and said it was his wife, Melania Trump, who had originally brought the case to his attention.
“She was telling me about, ‘Can you help A$AP Rocky?’” said Trump, who said he had also heard from others.
“Many, many members of the African American community have called me, friends of mine, and said, ‘Could you help?’ So I personally don’t know A$AP Rocky, but I can tell you that he has tremendous support from the African American community in this country,” he said.
“We’ll be talking to them,” Trump said, referring to Swedish officials. “We’ve already started.”
“We’re working with the state department, and we hope to get him home soon,” added the first lady.
The Ohio pastor Darrell Scott, a longtime Trump supporter who is African American and has worked with the administration on urban justice issues, said he was among those who raised the issue with Trump last Friday night after Rocky’s management reached out for assistance.
“We know that this is a high priority for the president and the state department, at the instruction of the president,” said Kareem Lanier, the co-chair of the Urban Revitalization Coalition who credited the White House with ensuring Rocky was moved to better holding conditions.
Both Lanier and Scott rejected the idea that Trump was calling attention to the issue to distract from criticism of his attacks against four Democratic congresswomen of color, noting the administration had been working on the issue before the latest brouhaha.
They applauded Trump for shining attention on the issue.
“Any time President Trump gets involved in anything, it brings a level of attention” to an issue that cannot be matched by those who “don’t have that cache or reach”, Lanier said.
Stockholm’s district court decided on Friday that Rocky would remain in custody another week to allow police to complete their investigation. They have until 25 July.
Jovicic, Rocky’s attorney, said he felt the decision was “unjust”, but remained confident in his case.

Humans are children of sages not monkeys: BJP MP
BJP MP Satya Pal Singh on Friday said that humans are 'special manufacturing of nature' and are the children of Indian sages. "I don't want to hurt the sentiments of those who think they're the children of monkeys," he added. Earlier, Singh had dismissed Darwin's evolution theory by saying that no one has seen an ape turn into a man.

India.com
New Delhi: BJP MP Satya Pal Singh famous for dismissing Darwin’s evolution theory in the past by remarking ‘no one saw an ape turn into a man’ dropped another bomb on Friday while speaking in the Lok Sabha.
Hitting out at the Opposition over their protests on The Protection of Human Rights (Amendment) Bill, 2019, he emphasised that Indian culture never talked about human rights rather focused on the holistic development of human character.
Satya Pal Singh, who is a former Mumbai Police chief then added, “Humans are special manufacturing of nature. We think that we are the children of Indian sages. I don’t want to hurt the sentiments of those who think that they are the children of monkeys.”
Opposing his statement were TMC’s Mahua Moitra and DMK’s Kanimozhi, who voiced their apprehensions strongly.
On being objected in the House, Singh retorted, “Only those who don’t understand the cost of human rights do this.”
Further elaborating, “Our religion says that everybody should be happy and healthy. Not only human beings, but every living being should be seen as friends. We talk about ”Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam”, not only about human beings. Human rights are foreign thinking.”
Later on, he accused several non-profit organisations of receiving funds from foreign groups and supporting ‘anti-national activities’.
The Protection of Human Rights (Amendment) Bill, 2019, was passed in the Lok Sabha even as several MPs objected to it. The Bill aims to change the constitution of the National Human Rights Commission and state rights bodies.

BJP, Cong equally responsible for atrocities on tribals: Mayawati
BSP's Mayawati on Friday targetted BJP and Congress on Sonbhadra firing incident and held both the parties equally responsible for the atrocities on tribals. "What needs to be stressed upon is that whoever is out of power among the two, sheds crocodile tears whenever there are (such) cases," she said. As many as 10 tribals were killed in the incident.

The Financial Express
BSP chief Mayawati on Friday hit out at both the national parties — BJP and Congress — for Sonbhadra incident in which 10 tribals including three women lost their lives. The BSP president said that both the parties are equally responsible for atrocities committed on the people belonging to the tribal community. She also said that the Congress during its rule ousted tribals from forest and some of them later became Naxals.
“The Congress and BJP governments at the Centre are equally responsible for the atrocities committed on tribals in the country. The tribals were ousted from the forest during Congress rule and some of them even became Naxals,” she said. The BSP chief said that now the members of the Kol/adivasi samaj were removed from Sonbhadra and killed during BJP rule. “But what needs to be stressed is that whoever is out of power among these two parties, sheds crocodile tears whenever there are cases of atrocities,” she added.
Mayawati’s statement comes on a day when Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi was detained on her way to Sonbhadra where 10 people were allegedly gunned down by a village head and his henchmen. The Congress leader was scheduled to meet the family of the victims but was stopped in Mirzapur, UP. In an apparent reference to today’s development, Mayawati said that the Congress was doing all this days after the incident but the BSP started pressurising the administration to do justice ever since the incident happened.
Former Congress President Rahul Gandhi today called the detention of Priyanka Gandhi as ‘illegal’ and ‘disturbing’. Priyanka Gandhi’s husband Robert Vadra in a social media post termed the detention as ‘completely unconstitutional’. “No documents were produced for the arrest…This is a complete abuse of law in every respect,” he said. He further said that the state government should immediately release her and let democracy be a democracy and not a dictatorship.

Rajiv’s error will be repeated if triple talaq not criminalised: Arif
Ex-Union Minister Arif Mohammad Khan on Friday said the Prime Minister Modi-led government will repeat the mistake committed by the Rajiv Gandhi-led government in the Shah Bano case if triple talaq is not criminalised. The Rajiv Gandhi government introduced a bill in 1986 reversing Supreme Court’s order saying triple talaq victim has the right to demand maintenance from her ex-husband.

The Financial Express
Batting for criminalising the practice of triple talaq, former Union minister Arif Mohammad Khan on Friday said that if it is not done the Modi government will be committing the same mistake as Rajiv Gandhi did in the Shah Bano case. Without naming the Congress, Khan said the party that had won over 400 seats in 1984 was suffering from the “curse of the destitute”. “What was Shah Bano given? Rs 147 to keep her body and soul together. The curse of destitute is haunting” them, he said. Khan said he wrote a six-page letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi in October last year, requesting him to criminalise the practice of triple talaq.
“In the letter, I explained to him how in 1986 by enacting a law we reversed the judgement of the Supreme Court and now if we do not enact a law to ensure that the judgement of the Supreme Court is followed in letter and spirit, if we fail to make a law to criminalise triple talaq then we would be making the same mistake that was committed in 1986,” he said.

Delivering a lecture here on ‘Why triple talaq should be made a punishable offence’, Khan said a lot of “churning is taking place in Rajya Sabha” over the passage of the Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Marriage) Bill 2019. “I am hopeful that this time the ordinance criminalising triple talaq would be passed by Rajya Sabha as there is a lot of churning taking place and people are talking about what happened in 1986 (Shah Bano case),” he said.
Khan was a minister of state in the Rajiv Gandhi government in 1986 but he resigned over the government’s stand in the Shah Bano case. Shah Bano was a Muslim woman from Indore. Divorced by her husband in 1978, she filed a criminal suit in court and won the right to alimony from her husband. Her husband had challenged the lower court’s order in the Supreme Court which upheld the lower court’s order. However, the then Rajiv Gandhi government brought a bill – Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Divorce) Act, 1986 in Parliament to reverse the judgment.
Khan had openly opposed the government’s decision to bring a bill in Parliament to reverse the Supreme Court’s order that the victim of the triple talaq has right to demand maintenance from her ex-husband under Section 125 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 which applies to all citizens regardless of caste or religion. Strongly supporting criminalisation of the practice of triple talaq, Khan said there is absolutely no doubt that if it becomes a proper law then it would help in upholding the dignity of women. He said the common argument given to oppose its criminalisation is that it is a matter of civil law not criminal.
“What these eloquently speaking men do not understand is that divorce is a civil matter and no one, neither a Hindu nor a Muslim, would be jailed for divorcing his wife but the practice of Triple Talaq is criminal,” he said. The Supreme Court had in 2017 banned the practice of triple talaq. But since the practice was still prevalent, a bill was brought to make it a penal offence. With the dissolution of the 16th Lok Sabha last month, the bill had lapsed as it was pending in Rajya Sabha.
The Bill, which proposes to make the practice of instant triple talaq (talaq-e-biddat) a penal offence, had faced objections from the opposition parties which claimed that jail term for a man for divorcing his wife was legally untenable. A fresh bill, Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Marriage) Bill, 2019, has now been introduced in Lok Sabha to replace an ordinance issued in February by the previous BJP-led NDA government.
The new bill is a copy of the ordinance in force. The government had promulgated the ordinance on triple talaq twice — in September 2018 and in February 2019 — as the contentious bill remained pending in Rajya Sabha Under the Bill, divorcing through instant triple talaq is illegal, void and will attract a jail term of three years for the husband.

Muslims being punished for not migrating to Pak: Azam Khan
Samajwadi Party MP from Uttar Pradesh Azam Khan on Saturday said that the mob lynching incidents in the country are punishments Muslims are getting for not migrating to Pakistan after 1947. He further said that the reason why their ancestors didn't go to Pakistan was that Maulana Azad, Jawaharlal Nehru, Sardar Patel and Mahatma Gandhi had made promises to Muslims.

New Delhi: Reacting over the recent mob lynching incidents, senior Samajwadi Party leader Azam Khan said that it’s the punishment which Muslims are getting after 1947.
“Muslims will face it whatever may it be.Why didn’t our ancestors go to Pakistan?Ask this to Maulana Azad, Jawaharlal Nehru, Sardar Patel and Bapu (Mahatma Gandhi). They had made promises to Muslims,” said Khan while speaking to ANI.
Last month, while participating in the debate on the Motion of Thanks to the President’s address, Khan had said Muslims had a choice to go to Pakistan during Partition.
“Our forefathers decided to stay here. They said this is our country. Graves of our forefathers are here … You (BJP) never had this choice (of going to Pakistan),” he said. He asserted that it hurts when Muslims are forced to recite ‘vande matram’.
“If the Constitution says one has to recite from a religious book, I will be the first one to do so,” he said.
Khan’s comments come amid spate of lynching incidents. Yesterday, three people were beaten to death on suspicion of cattle theft by locals in Saran district of Bihar.
Prior to this, 24-year-old Tabrez Ansari was lynched by a mob on alleged suspicion of theft. Ansari was tied to a pole and forced to chant ‘Jai Shri Ram’ and ‘Jai Hanuman’ repeatedly.
He was first taken to a local hospital for a preliminary check-up and later he was locked up in Seraikela jail in Jharkhand. After his health condition worsened, Tabrez was taken to Sadar hospital where the doctors declared him brought dead.
A similar incident was reported from Delhi when a Muslim man was allegedly attacked by three people after they failed to get him to chant ‘Jai Shree Ram’.
