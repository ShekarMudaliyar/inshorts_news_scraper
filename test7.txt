The Guardian
Avengers: Endgame has surpassed Avatar to become the highest-grossing film of all time.
The Marvel Studios sequel, directed by Anthony and Joe Russo, earned over £2.3bn ($2.9bn) in revenue by Sunday, since being released in April. Avatar, directed by James Cameron, which was released in 2009, previously held the record as the highest grossing movie of all time , earning $2.79bn.
Alan Horn, co-chairman and chief creative officer of the Walt Disney Studios, said: “A huge congratulations to the Marvel Studios and Walt Disney Studios teams, and thank you to the fans around the world who lifted Avengers: Endgame to these historic heights.
“Of course, even with the passage of a decade, the impact of James Cameron’s Avatar remains as powerful as ever, and the astonishing achievements of both of these films are ongoing proof of the power of movies to move people and bring them together in a shared experience.”
Producer Kevin Feige announced the news at Comic Con on Saturday, saying it would be a “matter of days” before Endgame became “the biggest film in history” but added that “if you adjust for inflation, [James Cameron] still holds the title”.
Chris Hemsworth, who starred as Thor in Endgame, congratulated his team for the achievement in an Instagram post: “Thank you to all the fans around the world that lifted Avengers Endgame to historic heights making it the top grossing film of all time!”
Avengers: Endgame is the sequel to 2012’s The Avengers, 2015’s Avengers: Age of Ultron, and 2018’s Avengers: Infinity War and the 22nd film in the Marvel cinematic universe and the fourth blockbuster in the Avengers series.
The film, which was first released on 25 April stars Robert Downey Jr, Chris Evans, Scarlett Johansson and Chris Hemsworth. It earned $1.22bn in its initial April release, achieving the biggest global opening of all time.

Koena Mitra gets 6 months in jail for cheque bouncing case
Koena Mitra has been sentenced to six months imprisonment by a metropolitan magistrate's court in a cheque bouncing case. The complaint, filed by model Poonam Sethi in 2013, alleges that Koena borrowed ₹22 lakh over a period of time but at the time of repayment, she gave a cheque of ₹3 lakh which bounced. Koena has however denied the allegations.

The Quint
Bollywood actor Koena Mitra has reportedly been convicted in a cheque bouncing case and sentenced to six months imprisonment by a metropolitan magistrate’s court. She was sentenced earlier in July. According to a report by Mumbai Mirror, the complaint was filed by model Poonam Sethi and Koena Mitra was asked to pay Rs 4.64 lakh to the complainant. The amount included interest of Rs 1.64 lakh.
Poonam Sethi had filed the complaint in 2013 on account of her cheque bouncing for “want of funds.” However, the allegations have been denied by Koena, who will soon challenge the court’s judgement.
According to case details reported by Mumbai Mirror, Koena Mitra had borrowed Rs 22 lakh from Poonam Sethi. This transaction occurred over a period of time. During repayment of the loan, Poonam Sethi received a cheque of Rs 3 lakh from Koena Mitra. However, this cheque was not accepted by the bank and bounced.
Following the dishonouring of the cheque, Poonam Sethi sent a legal notice to Koena Mitra on 19 July 2013. Even after receiving the legal notice, Koena Mitra was unable to pay the required amount. Subsequently, Poonam Sethi filed a court complaint on 10 October 2013.
During the court hearing of the case, Koena Mitra’s defence was based on the fact that the complainant did not have enough resources to be able to lend that big an amount. Additionally, she also claimed that her cheques had been stolen. These defences were not accepted by the magistrate of the Andheri Metropolitan Court.
“The case is totally false and I have been framed in the matter,” said Koena Mitra to the publication. She also added that her lawyers, who could not be present in the court during her final hearing, are in the process of appealing to the higher court.

He was my only child: Dad of 14-yr-old actor who died in car crash
Shivendra Singh, father of 14-year-old 'Sasural Simar Ka' fame child actor Shivlekh Singh who passed away recently in a car accident, said, "He was my only child." Speaking about the accident, Shivendra added, "My wife and I blanked out and when we woke up, we realised he was gone." They were returning to Raipur from Bilaspur when the accident happened.

Times Now
The TV industry went into a state of mourning last week when news of 14-year-old Shivlekh Singh’s death started doing the rounds. The teenager, who had acted in a number of shows, including Sasural Simar Ka and Bal Veer, among others, met with an accident on July 18 and died on the spot. His father, Shivendra Singh, mustered up the courage to talk about the unfortunate and heartbreaking incident and said that Shivlekh was his only son.
In an interview to a portal, Shivendra, who was in the same car with his wife, Lekhna, and Shivlekh, reveals, “The driver was hurt. My wife and I blanked out and when we woke up, we realised that our son was gone. I don't know what hit him. In fact, he was not even sitting in the front. We were rushed to the hospital but...”
The couple, along with their son, were returning from Bilaspur and were headed to Raipur when a speeding truck hit their car. While Shivendra, Lekhna and the driver of the car were injured in the accident, Shivlekh lost his life. Shivendra also confirmed that it was the truck driver's fault because of which the accident occurred. He added, “Shivlekh was my only child."



Once the news of Shivlekh’s death was made public on July 19, his co-stars were left in shock and couldn’t believe the news. Aastha Chaudhary, who shared screen space with him in the show Kesari Nandan, expressed her grief on social media and wrote, “Life is just so unfair….M still in shock …Shivlekh Singh you gone toooo soon . Rip.”



On the other hand, Shivlekh’s on-screen mother from the show Sriman Srimati, Sucheta Khanna, was quoted as saying that she was extremely shocked to hear about the 14-year-old actor’s demise. “It just shows how unpredictable our lives are. He was a very talented, disciplined, well-mannered and well-brought up boy,” she said in a report.

Stokes didn't ask us to not award 6 overthrows in WC final: Dharmasena
After a section of British media claimed that all-rounder Ben Stokes wanted umpires to not award England 6 overthrows in the 2019 World Cup final, umpire Kumar Dharmasena has said that no such request was made. Dharmasena further revealed that he apologised to New Zealand captain Kane Williamson the moment he realised he had made a mistake.
https://www.crictracker.com/kumar-dharmasena-concedes-erring-in-awarding-vital-runs-to-england-denies-ben-stokes-wanted-to-withdraw-overthrow-runs/?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts
CricTracker
It was another World Cup final for Kumar Dharmasena but this time, he hadn’t seen the best of days. The former Sri Lanka spinner, who is a top umpire in world cricket now, was slammed for awarding six runs to England after a throw from New Zealand’s Martin Guptill went for four overthrow runs after hitting the bat of a diving Ben Stokes at Lord’s on July 14. Former umpire Simon Taufel had later said that Dharmasena should have given five and not six runs to the chasing side. The extra run helped England tie the game and they went on to lift the trophy.
Dharmasena, 48, is nicknamed ‘unanduwa’ which roughly means ‘hard worker’ and he has shown his worth in the official’s role in the past. He was also in charge of the final of the World Cup in 2015 at the Melbourne Cricket Ground which also featured New Zealand as the losing side. The Black Caps might find it hard to swallow to fact that Dharmasena’s presence in their finals didn’t see the end results going their way.

England had needed 15 runs to win off the last over and after Stokes hit a six in the third ball, it was nine required off three. It was then when that overthrow drama took place and Stokes had come up with an apologising gesture after the ball went for four overthrows. Taufel had said that the second run shouldn’t have been added to England’s total since the batsmen (Stokes and Adil Rashid) hadn’t crossed when the fielder had released the throw.
Dharmasena later regretted giving the verdict. Speaking to Sunday Island, Sri Lanka, he said: “I made a judgmental call after consulting my colleague Marais Erasmus. It was like calling a no-ball or a wide and I couldn’t consult the third umpire. I was 100 per cent sure that the batsmen had crossed. It looked as if he had almost reached the popping crease.”
“I admit that I was wrong. I also admit that the rule has to change.”
Dharmasena also had his own take on the rule. “If the ball hits the stumps and goes for four, then it’s fine. But the moment the ball hits the bat or the batsmen, it’s got to be a dead ball.”
Meanwhile, a section of the British media had claimed that Stokes even went to the extent of asking the umpires to withdraw the four overthrow runs. Dharmasena rejected this version outright. He even had apologised to New Zealand skipper Kane Williamson the moment he realised that he had made a blunder.

Team TUM wins SpaceX Hyperloop pod contest with 463 kmph top speed
Technical University of Munich's Team TUM on Sunday won the annual SpaceX Hyperloop Pod Competition finals held at the Elon Musk-led space startup SpaceX's Hawthorne headquarters. Their pod achieved the top speed of 463.49 kmph (288 mph), highest among any team to run in the finals. TUM beat out three other finalist competitors - Delft Hyperloop, EPFL Hyperloop, and Swissloop.

TechCrunch
SpaceX  hosted its fourth annual SpaceX Hyperloop Pod Competition finals on Sunday at the test tube it built outside its Hawthorne HQ. We were on site for the competition, and watched as Team TUM, from the Technical University of Munich,  took home the win thanks to achieving the top speed overall of any team to run in the finals.
TUM (formerly known as team WARR Hyperloop in past competitions) is a repeat winner, and achieved a top speed of 288 mph in this year’s finals. That’s the fastest overall for a Hyperloop pod thus far – it beat its own record from last year of 284 mph set during the third SpaceX  student run-off. It wasn’t without incident, however – near the end of its run, there was a spark and some debris appeared to fly off the craft, but it still survived the run mostly intact and satisfied SpaceX judges to qualify for the win.
TUM beat out three other finalist competitors, including Delft Hyperloop, EPFL Hyperloop, and Swissloop. Delft unfortunately had a communication error that cut their run short at just around 650 feet into the just over 3/4 mile SpaceX Hyperloop test track. EPFL managed a top speed of 148 mph and Swissloop topped out at 160 mph.

SpaceX Hyperloop Pod test track at its Hawthorne HQ. This is the end where student teams load in their test pod during the annual competition.
For the teams that did get to run on Sunday, the process involved loading their pod, which are roughly the size of bobsleds but little more than engines on wheels, onto the single track which runs the length of the interior of the Hyperloop test tube. The tube is then sealed and de-pressurized to near vacuum, which is essentially how Musk’s original Hyperloop concept envisioned the super-speed transportation method would work.
All the teams gave a good showing, and the total number of student teams was actually 21, with over 700 individual sin total taking part in the competition from a variety of schools including Cal Poly, the University of Wisconsin-Madison, the Indian Institute of Technology and my own alma mater the University of Windsor (who worked with St. Clair College on their pod).
Teams had to prove to their SpaceX and Boring Company staff advisors that they were ready to run in the tube in order to qualify for the finals, and spent two weeks prior to the finals on Sunday trying to do just that. Of those 21 teams, only the four finalists managed to get the green light to run in the final competition, based on advisor criteria that includes safety and survivability of their pod design. There’s a kind of ‘good luck’ mantra at the competition of saying ‘Break a pod’ prior to a run, but SpaceX engineers don’t actually want team pods to experience catastrophic failure inside the tube while on a run. This year, the competition was even more challenging because all pods have to use their own communication systems for the first time, and the pods must be designed to propel themselves to within 100 feet of the far end of the tube before they stop.
21 teams in total competed in this year’s competition, and they all brought their pods to display on race day, even though only four finalists actually ran their pods through the test track.
21 teams in total competed in this year’s competition, and they all brought their pods to display on race day, even though only four finalists actually ran their pods through the test track.
Most of the teams I spoke to who failed to qualify were dismayed but also resolute on coming back and qualifying next year. Some did express a bit of frustration about the gap between some of the teams from smaller schools, and those in the final four (who do qualify repeatedly year after year). Many of the finalists have deep-pocketed corporate backers, including Airbus,  while some of the smaller schools have next to no funding – resulting in a cost delta of hundreds of thousands of dollars when it comes to the total bill for the test pods built.
That said, all the teams are clearly thrilled to be able to participate, and see the competition as a chance to essentially get scored to work at one of Musk’s many high tech ventures, including SpaceX, Tesla  and The Boring Company. For those companies, too, it seems like a no-brainer to attempt to recruit from the engineering ranks of these best-in-class technical undergrad and graduate students.
EPFL Hyperloop didn’t win the competition – but they have reason to celebrate, since at least some graduates will probably ‘win’ jobs at Musk’s various companies.

“I think the competition is fun, and inspiring and also useful technology comes out of it,” Musk said regarding the purpose of the event, before answering a final question from Boring Company President Steve Davis  about whether or not there will be another competition next year – “Oh yeah of course,” Musk replied, to much applause from the crowd of competitors.

Business-to-business digital payment solutions provider PayMate has scooped up $25 million in its Series D round from Visa, Recruit Strategic Partners, and Brand Capital. Existing investor Mayfair 101 also participated in the round that will be completed by the next two months.
The Mumbai-based startup will be deploying the fresh capital to accelerate growth and expand its business overseas. Earlier this year, it had announced to foray into international markets such as the Middle East, Africa, and central and eastern Europe in collaboration with Visa.
PayMate essentially runs a proprietary B2B cloud-based payments platform and helps large enterprises and SMEs transition to digital payments, and manages vendor and customer payments and invoicing.
In addition to this, businesses can easily apply for credit at competitive rates. The firm has partnered with NBFCs and banks to provide credit to SMEs that it extended through its own platform.
The startup earns via the transaction fees and claims its revenue has jumped 400% over the past year. For FY19, it recorded $5 billion in processing volumes and aims to reach double-digit growth by the next fiscal.
Apart from expanding the business, PayMate has been looking to scale up for data localisation, sales, support and compliance activities.
Last year, PayMate had acquired peer-to-peer lending platform Z2P Technologies to offer a lending platform to small businesses. Backed by the likes of Lightbox Ventures, PayMate competes with Razorpay, PayUbiz, Infibeam’s CCAvenue, Instamojo in B2B space.
The development was reported by Mint.

Iran captures 17 CIA spies, sentences some to death: Reports
Iran has captured 17 spies working for the US' Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and some have been sentenced to death, Iranian media reported on Monday. "The identified spies were employed in sensitive and vital private sector centres in the economic, nuclear, infrastructural, military and cyber areas...where they collected classified information," Iran's Intelligence Ministry reportedly said.

Reuters
DUBAI (Reuters) - Iran captured 17 spies working for the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and some have been sentenced to death, Iranian media reported on Monday.  
Iranian state television published images it said showed the CIA officers who were in touch with the suspected spies. 
There was no immediate comment on the Iranian allegations by the CIA or U.S. officials.    
Iran announced in June that it had broken up an alleged CIA spy ring but it was unclear whether Monday’s announcement was linked to the same case.  
The announcement comes after three months of spiraling confrontation between Iran and the West that began when new tighter U.S. sanctions took effect in May.  
Last week Iran captured a British tanker after Britain’s Royal Marines seized an Iranian tanker on July 4. 
In a statement read on state television, the Ministry of Intelligence said 17 spies were arrested during the Iranian calendar year that ended in March 2019.  
“The identified spies were employed in sensitive and vital private sector centers in the economic, nuclear, infrastructure, military and cyber areas... where they collected classified information,” read the ministry statement. 
In a separate report, the semi-official Fars news agency quoted a Ministry of Intelligence official as saying some of those arrested had been sentenced to death. 
An Iranian television documentary aired on Monday purported to show a CIA officer recruiting an Iranian man in the United Arab Emirates. 
“Because there are so many intelligence officers in Dubai. It is very dangerous... Iranian intelligence,” a woman was shown telling an Iranian in the documentary about alleged CIA spying in Iran which was broadcast on state television. 
The woman spoke Persian with an accent which appeared to be American.

Pirates steal cash, sailors' shoes in attack on S Korea-flagged ship
Pirates attacked a South Korea-flagged cargo ship near the Singapore Strait on Monday, stealing thousands of dollars in cash and the sailors' shoes, South Korean authorities said. The pirates also took away belongings including mobile phones and clothes from the cargo ship's 22 crew members. Officials said the ship was sailing normally after the robbery.

SEOUL/SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Pirates attacked a South Korean-flagged cargo ship in the South China Sea early on Monday, stealing thousands of dollars in cash and even the sailors’ shoes, South Korean authorities said. 
Two people sustained minor injuries when seven pirates boarded the CK Bluebell and made off with $13,000 and belongings including mobile phones, clothes and shoes from the 22-strong crew, officials from the oceans and fisheries ministry said.   
Tougher policing has made piracy less frequent on the strategic shipping route in recent years. 
The dry bulk vessel CK Bluebell had set sail from its anchorage off Singapore on Saturday afternoon, heading northeast for South Korea’s port of Incheon, Refinitiv Eikon ship tracking data showed.  
Korean officials said the ship was sailing normally after the robbery.

The incident took place near the Singapore Strait, a busy sea lane that runs past Indonesia, Malaysia and Singapore, South Korea’s Yonhap news agency said.  
Singapore’s Maritime and Port Authority (MPA) said the incident did not take place in city-state’s waters. 
“The MPA was informed by the Korea Coast Guard that it took place in the South China Sea near Anambas Islands,” a spokesman said.   
This month, China’s Ministry of Transport raised its security recommendation for Chinese vessels in the nearby Malacca Strait, between the Malay peninsula and the Indonesian island of Sumatra. 
A Chinese official declined to specify the reason for the new security level, saying only that the decision was the result of comprehensive research taking into account all factors.

New Delhi: All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen (AIMIM) chief Asaduddin Owaisi on Monday lambasted Bhopal MP Pragya Thakur over her recent ‘not elected to get drains and toilets cleaned’ remarks. Terming her statement ‘unfortunate’, Owaisi said,”She has openly opposed PM Modi’s program. The MP believes in the caste and class discrimination happening in India.”
He added,”She made such remarks because that is her thought process. I am not at all surprised, neither I’m shocked by her obnoxious statement. She clearly tells that the kind of work the caste has defined, that should continue. It is very unfortunate.”
Earlier, Congress leader Tariq Anwar had criticised Thakur for her remarks saying,” Her words showed her attitude towards the clean India campaign. PM Modi should take action against her.
Besides, Congress spokeswoman Shobha Oza had also reacted sharply to Bhopal MP’s remarks. She had said Thakur’s statement exposes the BJP as she has ‘tossed aside Prime Minister Modi’s Swachh Bharat Abhiyan’. “It makes clear that the BJP only believes in slogans and ‘jumlas’… it is not even remotely interested in development and public benefit,” she added.
Yesterday, while speaking at Sehore, which comes under her parliamentary constituency of Bhopal, Thakur had said,”We will with all honesty do what we have been elected for, so keep in mind, we are not here for cleaning a drain. Is that clear?”
The firebrand leader was responding to a party worker who complained about the unhygienic conditionsin the town that was the district headquarters for Bhopal district till the mid 1970s.
“An MP should be asked for parliamentarian’s work. MP’s work is to join hands with MLAs, corporators and public representatives for development,” she said.
“You get my phone number with ease and call me up. I will be here after the Lok Sabha session gets over. Will give you a patient hearing. Your problems will be looked into. Whatever funds we get will be used for public good,” she added further.

No blanket ban on crypto trading in India yet, says govt
There is no blanket ban on cryptocurrency trading in India yet, Minister of State for Finance Anurag Thakur said. "Presently, there's no separate law for dealing with cryptocurrency-related issues. Hence, all concerned departments and law enforcement agencies...take action as per the relevant existing laws," he added. In 2018, RBI had barred banks from serving firms dealing with cryptocurrencies.

New Delhi: Despite banking restrictions put in place by the Reserve Bank of India, the country has not put any blanket ban on trading in cryptocurrencies yet, the government has clarified.
Responding to questions in the Rajya Sabha on whether the government has prohibited cryptocurrency in the country, Minister of State for Finance and Corporate Affairs Anurag Thakur this week said the answer was no.
"Presently, there is no separate law for dealing with issues relating to cryptocurrencies. Hence, all concerned departments and law enforcement agencies, such as RBI, Enforcement Directorate and Income Tax authorities, etc. take action as per the relevant existing laws," the Minister said.
"Similarly, police/courts take action on IPC (Indian Penal Code) offences. Further, in view of the risks and dangers associated with cryptocurrencies, (the) government and RBI have been issuing advisories, press releases and circulars to the public," he added.

Earlier the Reserve Bank of India issued a circular banning regulated entities from providing services to crypto businesses. The ban went into effect on July 6 last year, Bitcoin.com reported on Friday.
But a draft bill for banning cryptocurrency has been in the works for some time with Economic Affairs Secretary Subhash Chandra Garg leading the exercise.
According to the draft "Banning of Cryptocurrency and Regulation of Official Digital Currency Bill 2019", holding, selling or dealing in cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin could soon land you in jail for 10 years.
The draft has proposed a 10-year prison sentence for persons who "mine, generate, hold, sell, transfer, dispose, issue or deal in cryptocurrencies.
Besides making it completely illegal, the bill makes holding of cryptos a non-bailable offence.
A cryptocurrency is a digital or virtual currency that uses cryptography for security and is generally based on Blockchain technology, a distributed ledger enforced by a disparate network of computers. Bitcoin is the most popular cryptocurrency in the world.

The funds will be utilised to meet PEL's working capital needs and upcoming debt-related payment obligations, reports said. Recently, the company had made principal and coupon payments on outstanding debt of reportedly around ₹1,700 crore.

MUMBAI: Ajay Piramal-controlled Piramal Enterprises Ltd has raised  ₹1,500 crore from Standard Chartered Bank through non-convertible debentures (NCD), said two people aware of the development.
The money will be used to meet working capital requirements of the group, including for the lending business Piramal Capital and Housing Finance and for upcoming debt-related payment obligations, said the first person cited above, requesting anonymity as he is not authorized to speak with the media.
“The financing from Standard Chartered will go towards meeting near-term needs and has a repayment date in January 2020," he said.
According to Piramal Enterprises’ regulatory filings, in the past week, the company has made principal and coupon payments on outstanding debt worth around  ₹1,700 crore. These comprised large loans from HDFC Bank and Deutsche Bank, which had subscribed to NCDs worth  ₹1,000 crore and  ₹590 crore respectively in 2016, the filings showed.
An email sent to Piramal Group on 19 June did not elicit any response. A spokesperson for Standard Chartered declined to comment.
The financing from Standard Chartered is part of the group’s plans to raise more debt financing from long-term sources of funds, said the second person cited above.
“They (Piramal Enterprises) have significantly improved their borrowing mix towards long-term sources of funds. The company has raised nearly  ₹16,500 crore of bank loans and NCDs during the second half of fiscal 2019 and has reduced its exposure of commercial paper to  ₹8,900 crore from  ₹18,000 crore, in the same period," he said.
The company’s latest investor presentation says banks contributed 71% of its total borrowing mix as of 31 March, up from 49% at September end.
The group is also planning to tap foreign currency borrowings and further increase borrowing from banks, the presentation said.
On 9 July, rating agency Crisil reaffirmed a rating of A1+ on the commercial paper programme of Piramal Enterprises, followed by a reaffirmation of Piramal Capital and Housing Finance Ltd’s A1+ rating for its commercial paper programme worth  ₹10,500 crore.

Seniors purposely didn't perform, laughed after defeats: Naib
All-rounder Gulbadin Naib, who was Afghanistan's captain in 2019 World Cup, has claimed that his team's senior players didn't perform deliberately in the tournament. "They weren't giving attention to me. They laughed instead of being sad after defeats and didn't even look at me when asked to bowl," he added. Notably, Naib was removed from captaincy after the World Cup.

Afghanistan endured an extremely tough time at the 2019 World Cup. They lost all nine matches at the competition despite coming extremely close to victory on as many as three occasions. Their captain Gulbadin Naib looked a bit out of ideas at times and was unable to handle the pressure and after the tournament, has been sacked from the helm. He has now made some serious allegations against the senior cricketers in the team stating that they didn’t support him during the tough times.
Afghanistan were found wanting in demanding conditions against the teams like England, Australia, New Zealand and others. But they fared really well against their Asian neighbours and dragged India extremely close losing the game by only 11 runs. Their encounter against Pakistan went down to the wire and at one stage, were the favourites to win the match.

But the team, especially Gulbadin Naib, crumbled under pressure and Imad Wasim and Wahab Riaz took Pakistan home in a tense chase.
Gulbadin Naib was made the captain of the team just ahead of the World Cup and even the players like Mohammad Nabi and Rashid Khan had expressed their disappointment over the same. While the skipper never came out with controversial statements during the tournament, he has now accused some of the senior cricketers that they were not playing well deliberately.
He also claimed that they didn’t support him on the field whenever he used to ask them to bowl at times. “We depend mostly on seniors in the World Cup but they were deliberately not performing, not giving attention to me, they were laughing instead of being sad after defeats & even not looking at me when asked to bowl,” Naib was quoted as saying by Afghanistan journalist.

Gulbadin Naib has been sacked from captaincy now and Rashid Khan has been appointed the captain of the team across all the formats. He has assured the leg-spinner of all the required support and Rashid acknowledged the same in a tweet recently.

Grey sales of high-end phones causing ₹2,500 cr revenue loss: ICEA
The sale of high-end mobile phones in the grey market is causing an estimated loss of ₹2,500 crore annually, mobile industry body India Cellular and Electronics Association (ICEA) has claimed. It suggested imposing a maximum customs duty of ₹4,000 on handsets priced above ₹20,000 to stop the practice. Currently, a basic customs duty of 20% is imposed on imported handsets.
https://www.financialexpress.com/industry/grey-sales-of-high-end-phones-causing-revenue-loss-of-rs-2500-crore-icea/1651427/?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts
The Financial Express
Sale of high-end mobile phones in the grey market is causing an estimated loss of Rs 2,500 crore annually to the exchequer, mobile industry body India Cellular and Electronics Association has claimed. The industry body has suggested imposing a maximum customs duty of Rs 4,000 on handsets priced above Rs 20,000 to discourage duty evasion and wipe out the premium for illegal sales. A basic customs duty (BCD) of 20 per cent is imposed on imported handsets at present.
“High-end phones that are getting sold in the grey market are estimated to cause a loss of Rs 2,500 crore annually on account of non-payment of basic customs duty (BCD) and also goods and services tax,” India Cellular and Electronics Association (ICEA) Chairman Pankaj Mohindroo told PTI.
The industry body has requested Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman that the BCD of 20 per cent should continue but with a cap of Rs 4,000 on mobile phones priced above Rs 20,000, Mohindroo said. The step will wipe out high margins on the illegal sale of high-end handsets and give a boost to legal imports, the ICEA has reasoned.
“Revenue impact on this would be an additional duty of Rs 700 crore of BCD approximately, which will get netted off because of the reduction in duty on the legal import. Hence, there will be no net gain or net loss. The GST collection will, however, go up by over Rs 1,000 crore and the market environment will become much cleaner and regularised,” Mohindroo said.
The ICEA said that recent budget was focussed on promoting electronics manufacturing in the country with a provision to write off capital expenditure for under section of 35 AD of Income Tax act.
“The entire mobile phone and its components manufacturing ecosystem should be brought under the finally notified scheme,” he said.The industry body has requested the government to bring down GST on mobile phone parts to 12 per cent from 18 per cent at present as it is creating an inverted duty structure in the sector.
The GST on mobile phones is 12 per cent while 18 per cent on parts such as back covers, batteries, headphones etc. Mohindroo said that the inverted duty structure has led to a serious cash flow issue for manufacturers and is adversely impacting the competitiveness of locally-produced mobile phones.
India had two mobile phone factories in 2014 but now, it has 268 factories engaged in the manufacturing of mobile phones and their accessories. Prime Minister Narendra Modi during his 13th India-Japan annual summit had announced making India top mobile phone manufacturing destination.
Though there is a mechanism in GST to provide a refund of input tax credit (ITC), there is no way to provide a refund of accumulated ITC on the GST paid on capital goods and services in case of inverted structure. “All new manufacturers are investing heavily on Capex (capital expenditure) and business promotion for creating a brand image. GST on such expense is an additional cost to the manufacturer, as they are not allowed refund of such accumulated credit,” Mohindroo said.
The ICEA has urged the finance minister to reduce timeframe for refund of GST credits to at most a week. The industry body has also demanded input credit on manufacturing plant or shed, and canteen service, among others.

Bengali film and television actress Rimjhim Mitra and two others joined the BJP in the presence of state BJP President Dilip Ghosh. Mitra said that it's the first time she is "openly supporting" a party as she felt "cornered" working under the "monopolistic approach" in the Bengali film and TV industry. On July 18, several Bengali actors joined the party.

Kolkata: Three days after 12 Bengali actors joined the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), film and television actress Rimjhim Mitra on Sunday became a part of the party. Actor Surojit Choudhury and model Pamela Goswami also followed suit.
Notably, Rimjhim is a popular TV actress who won ‘Jhalak Dikhla Jaa Bangla’ in 2013 and was also seen in Bigg Boss Bangla. She also made her mark in films, like ‘Teen Yaari Katha’ and ‘Cross Connection’.
“I am not happy working under the monopolistic approach in the Bengali film and TV industry. I have felt cornered many times and this is the first time I am openly talking about supporting a party. I have joined the BJP as I found it welcoming,” Rimjhim said after she was handed the BJP flag by its state President Dilip Ghosh.
On July 18, 12 Bengali actors, including Parno Mittra, joined the BJP. The actors had joined the party in the presence of state BJP chief Dilip Ghosh and senior leader Mukul Roy in Delhi. Film and TV personalities Rishi Kaushik, Kanchana Moitra, Rupanjana Mitra, Parno and Biswajit Ganguly were among the dozen of celebrities who cast their lot with the BJP at its Delhi headquarters.
On Saturday, Mukul Roy had claimed that as many as 107 CPM, Congress and TMC MLAs will be joining the BJP. “107 West Bengal MLAs from CPM, Congress and TMC will join BJP. We have their list prepared and they are in contact with us,” Roy had said.
Right after the Lok Sabha election results were announced, Banerjee suffered a jolt as two of her party’s MLAs and over 50 councillors joined hands with the BJP.
Besides, TMC MLAs Subhrangshu Roy (Son of BJP leader Mukul Roy) and Tusharkanti Bhattacharya, CPI(M)’s Debendra Nath Roy also defected to the saffron party in presence of senior leaders Mukul Roy and Kailash Vijayvargiya.

Central agencies threatening TMC leaders to join BJP: Mamata
West Bengal Chief Minister and TMC supremo Mamata Banerjee on Sunday alleged that central agencies are threatening TMC leaders over chit fund scams if they don't join the BJP. "They are offering ₹2 crore and a petrol pump to our MLAs to switch," Mamata said. "Just like in Karnataka, the BJP is involved in horse-trading everywhere," Mamata further said.

The Quint
West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee on Sunday, 21 July, alleged that central agencies are threatening TMC leaders and elected representatives with prison term in chit fund scam cases, if they don't join the BJP.
Addressing the Martyrs' Day rally in Kolkata, the Trinamool Congress (TMC) chief accused the saffron party of luring TMC MLAs with money and other perks.

"The BJP is offering Rs 2 crore and a petrol pump to our MLAs to switch over... Just like in Karnataka, the BJP is indulging in horse trading everywhere. It is trying to replicate this model here, too," she alleged.
Reacting to her allegations, West Bengal BJP president Dilip Ghosh dared Banerjee to name the CBI officers who had allegedly threatened TMC leaders to join the saffron camp. She, however, had not named any central agency.
The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) and the Enforcement Directorate (ED) are separately probing two multi-crore-rupee Ponzi scheme cases in West Bengal.
MAMATA SAYS RAIL SERVICES CURTAILED, RAILWAYS REFUTES CHARGE
She also claimed rail services were curtailed to stop people from attending her rally, even as the Railways maintained that it was running a number of special trains in addition to the ones scheduled for the day.
RETURN BALLOT PAPERS: MAMATA CALLS LOK SABHA ELECTIONS A ‘MYSTERY’
She also requested the EC to conduct Panchayat and Municipal elections with ballot paper instead of EVMs.
“We tell the BJP, first return the black money you used in the elections. Return the black money and cut money – all that you have taken till now – and used for winning elections,” Banerjee said.
Banerjee’s nephew, Abhishek Banerjee also joined her call against EVMs in the rally.
He said, “Return democracy, we want ballots not (EVM) machines.”
WHY IS THIS SIGNIFICANT?
The Martyrs' Day rally is organised by the party every year on July 21 in the memory of 13 Youth Congress activists killed in police firing in 1993 during the Left Front regime in West Bengal. Banerjee was a leader of the Youth Congress at that time.
This time rally is being held in the backdrop of BJP's impressive performance in the Lok Sabha polls in which the party won 18 of the 42 seats in the state, only four less than the ruling TMC.

THE CONFLICT
BJP state president and MP Dilip Ghosh directed party workers to not allow TMC leaders to leave for Kolkata to participate in the rally if they did not return the "cut money" they had collected from people.
Following this, TMC leader and minister Chandrima Bhattacharya lodged an FIR against Ghosh.
TMC MP and Mamata’s nephew Abhishek Banerjee, speaking to The Quint, said that BJP will “not be allowed to divide Bengal.”
Around 5,000 policemen will be deployed to look after security at the rally and maintain normality.

A legend like MS Dhoni knows when to retire: Chief selector Prasad
Talking about speculation surrounding MS Dhoni's retirement, chief selector MSK Prasad said that a legendary cricketer like Dhoni knows when to retire.

Prasad added that the selection committee wants to groom Rishabh Pant.

Team India’s much-awaited squads for the upcoming West Indies tour were announced on Sunday and MS Dhoni‘s name was missing from both ODI and T20I teams. On Saturday, the news broke through that the veteran had made himself unavailable for the tour and since the World Cup, a lot is being said about his retirement. Expectedly, the chief selector MSK Prasad was asked a question on Dhoni’s retirement when he addressed the media.
Various reports have surfaced over the last couple of weeks speculating the MS Dhoni’s future and it was reported that the experienced player will be part of the team to groom Rishabh Pant. People close to him claimed that he will be playing the T20 World Cup next year while Dhoni’s parents wanted him to retire. However, MSK Prasad is of the opinion that taking a retirement is purely an individual call.

He also stressed the fact that a player of the stature of MS Dhoni understands when to call it quits. “A legend like MS Dhoni knows when to retire. Retirement is a purely individual call,” MSK Prasad said when asked about the 38-year-old’s retirement.
There is no doubt that MS Dhoni has played his last game at the World Cup and Rishabh Pant will take over the gloves from him when the former will retire. MSK Prasad cleared that they have laid down a few plans and one of them is grooming Pant. He also cleared that Dhoni made himself unavailable for the West Indies which clears the air about him being dropped.
“He’s unavailable for this series but we had certain roadmaps&plans till WC. Subsequently, we’ve laid down a few more plans&thought of giving as many opportunities to Pant & to see he is groomed. This is our plan right now,” the chief selector further added. With Team India set to face South Africa from September 15, anything about MS Dhoni’s future will be known before that series now.

India’s squads for the three series in the West Indies starting with three T20Is on August 3 were announced on Sunday, 11 days after the team crashed out of the 2019 World Cup. The Chief selector MSK Prasad announced the squads at a press conference in Mumbai and a number of changes were made – especially in the limited-overs squads.
Speculation of regular captain Virat Kohli taking a break from the T20Is and ODIs was buried as he was named as the skipper for all the three formats. India will play three T20Is and as many ODIs before the two-match Test series starts on August 22.

Ace pacer Jasprit Bumrah was rested for the limited-over series though he will join the Test squad. Manish Pandey, who is leading India ‘A’ in the West Indies at the moment, was picked for both the T20Is and ODI squads. Chahar brothers – Rahul and Deepak – made it along with Krunal Pandya while Washington Sundar made a return.
However, the selection committee failed to impress many who thought Mayank Agarwal also deserved a call-up in the ODI squad. The 28-year-old batsman from Karnataka was recently picked in India’s World Cup squad in England as a replacement for an injured Vijay Shankar though he did not get a game. The selection sparked controversy as standby batsman Ambati Rayudu was ignored and after being snubbed, he retired from cricket altogether.
Mayank’s selection for the World Cup squad had raised quite a few eyebrows since the man is yet to play for India in an ODI. He was picked for India’s Test squad in Australia last year and played two vital 70-run knocks in both the matches he played. But now, after the man had already featured in an ODI squad and that too at the World Cup, questions are being asked why he was left out.
Mayank has played in 75 List ‘A’ games in which he has amassed 3605 runs at an impressive average of with 12 centuries and 14 half-centuries and looks a decent enough player to be part of the team.

ANI
By  Ashoke Raj New Delhi [India], July 21 (ANI): With the Congress leadership in limbo after the resignation of Rahul Gandhi, party veteran Natwar Singh on Sunday joined the chorus backing Priyanka Gandhi Vadra for the top post, adding that having a non-Gandhi at the helm will cause the party to split.Praising Priyanka for her visit to Sonbhadra to meet victims of a firing incident, the former external affairs minister told ANI that she is capable of handling the party. "You must have witnessed what she did in a village in Uttar Pradesh. It was amazing. She stayed there and achieved what she wanted to," he said.Singh suggested that Rahul's decision of a having someone from outside the Gandhi family as the party chief will have to be reversed.On being asked if Priyanka would be elected as the party president, the Congressman said, "It will depend on Priyanka because her brother (Rahul Gandhi) had said that nobody from the Gandhi family will become the Congress president. Now, the family will have to reverse the decision and only they can do it."Earlier, Anil Shastri, son of former prime minister Lal Bahadur Shastri, had said that Priyanka Gandhi should be made the Congress president as no one other than her is "100 per cent acceptable".Shastri, speaking to ANI, had also warned that if somebody else is made the supremo and a section of the outfit does not accept them, chances are that the party will disintegrate.Natwar Singh echoed similar sentiments and said that if anyone is elected from outside the Gandhi family, the Congress will split within 24 hours."It is unfortunate that the country's 134-years-old party does not have a party president. I do not think apart from the Gandhi family, anyone should be elected as the president," Singh added.Around 50 days after Rahul stepped down as Congress president, taking moral responsibility for the humiliating defeat in the Lok Sabha elections, the grand old party is yet to finalize its new chief.Gandhi, now a lawmaker from Wayanad in Kerala, became the Congress president in 2017. He had, earlier this month, written a lengthy four-page letter making his resignation from the post public. Taking responsibility for the drubbing in Lok Sabha polls, Rahul had said it would not be right for him to suggest a successor.At present Congress in Goa has completely lost foot, after 10 of its MLAs switched side with the BJP. This has reduced its strength to five in the Assembly.Similarly, in Karnataka, the situation is equally embarrassing for the party, as its coalition government with JD(S) is facing a tough time. The government had slumped into a crisis following the resignation of 16 dissident MLAs and now its survival seems to be tough.The Congress won 52 seats in the recent general elections, which is just eight more than its 2014 Lok Sabha tally of 44.

Naqvi was responding to a question about Samajwadi Party leader Azam Khan's statement of Muslims being punished for not migrating to Pakistan after 1947. Congress's Randeep Surjewala criticised Naqvi saying BJP is trying to shield culprits.

Union Minister for Minority Affairs Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi told India Today on Sunday, 21 July that most of the cases of lynching are fake
This was in response to India Today’s question on Samajwadi Party leader Azam Khan’s statement of Muslims “serving a sentence” after the Partition.
Khan had said, “If Muslims went to Pakistan, they would not get this punishment. Why our ancestors did not go to Pakistan? They regarded India as their own country. Now they will be punished and they will have to endure,” adding that the Muslims of this country had been living a very “disgusting life”.
Naqvi’s statement’s was criticised by senior Congress leader Randeep Surjewala who accused the BJP of protecting the accused.
Quoting Surjewala, India Today reported, “BJP doesn’t feel anything for the minorities. Everyone in the ruling party is trying to shield the culprits.”
Since 2015, 98 people have been victims of mob lynchings across India. According to Indiaspend, 84% of the victims of lynchings due to cow-related violence were Muslims.
Naqvi isn’t alone when it comes to downplaying cases of mob lynchings.
Recently, Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar told The Print that the Saran lynching incident of two tribal men and a Muslim man shouldn’t be viewed as a case of “mob lynching” as three victims “had been caught stealing cattle”.
Kumar told The Print, “It is an unfortunate incident. But it should not be seen as mob lynching. Those killed were Nats (a Scheduled Tribe group) and those who killed them belong to downtrodden classes. The incident occurred when the three were caught red-handed stealing cattle. It resulted in angry villagers beating them up leading to their deaths. It is basically an incident arising due to local development.”
Another minister of the JD(U)-BJP state government said that it was a case of “law and order” since the victims weren’t forced to chant Jai Shri Ram.

BJP won LS polls by using EVMs, CRPF and EC: Mamata
West Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee claimed that the BJP won the general elections by using EVMs, CRPF, Central Police and Election Commission.

New Delhi: West Bengal Chief Minister and Trinamool Congress Supremo Mamata Banerjee on Sunday claimed that the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) won the Lok Sabha elections by cheating by using EVMs, CRPF and Central Police and Election Commission.
“In Lok Sabha elections they won by cheating- by using EVMs, CRPF and Central Police & Election Commission. We want change, not revenge. You won 18 seats and are blowing your trumpet. When we had won 26 seats in the past, we didn’t take over any party office. We won with our hard work: ,” Banerjee said while addressing TMC annual Martyrs’ Day rally in Kolkata.
Banerjee also accused the ruling party of indulging in horse-trading. “The BJP is offering Rs 2 crore and a petrol pump to our MLAs to switch over. Just like in Karnataka, the BJP is indulging in horse-trading everywhere,” she alleged.
Furthermore, the Chief Minister asserted that she will request the Election Commission to conduct Panchayat and Municipal elections through ballot paper. “Do not forget that the EVMs were earlier used in England, France, Germany and America. But they have now stopped using them…. So why cannot we bring the ballot papers back?” she asked.
The TMC holds the Martyrs’ Day rally every year on July 21 in the memory of the 13 Youth Congress activists, who were killed in 1993 police firing during a political demonstration led by Mamata. Banerjee was a leader of the Youth Congress at that time and the Left Front was in power in West Bengal.

No one can touch Article 370 until Kashmir issue resolved: Farooq
National Conference President Farooq Abdullah on Saturday said that until the issue of Kashmir is resolved, no power on earth can touch Article 370. He further said, "If Article 35-A is annulled, then all the successive presidential orders will get annulled automatically." "It was the then Maharaja who gave the state subject rights to its people in 1927," Abdullah added.

Times Now
Srinagar: Jammu and Kashmir National Conference (JKNC) president Farooq Abdullah on Saturday stressed that revoking Article 370 and Article 35-A will be equivalent to a constitutional coup. He went on to add that Article 370 is essential, unassailable and will remain in effect despite the "uneducated rants" of certain people.
While speaking at a party convention in Handwara area of Kupwara district, the former Jammu and Kashmir Chief Minister said, "Keeping in view the special circumstances (at the time of the accession of J&K to India), Article 370 was added to the Constitution of India. The Article will remain as it is until the final resolution of the issue of Jammu and Kashmir is not reached to."
"So until the issue is solved, no power on earth can touch the article 370. The uneducated rants of those who want to obliterate Article 370 are far-fetched, fanciful and devoid of any genuineness," added Farooq Abdullah.
The former J&K CM further added that if Article 35-A is annulled then all the successive presidential orders will get annulled automatically. He explained that it was the then Maharaja who gave the state subject rights to the people of the state in 1927.



He then shifted aim to the BJP-led Central government saying, "They are well aware of the fact that until National Conference remains in the state it will painstakingly protect the interests of the state. They are frightened of us."
"Anxious and unnerved, New Delhi has employed various henchmen in the state to frustrate the efforts of National Conference towards protecting the special status of our state," he added.
Earlier in the day, Union Defence Minister Rajnath Singh urged the people who are running the movement in Kashmir to sit and talk with all the stakeholders so that a conclusion can be reached.



However, he also asserted that the problem of Kashmir will get solved and no power in the world can stop it. "If somebody does not want a solution through talks then we know very well how a solution can be found," said the union minister.

LIC offers to lend ₹1.25 lakh cr by 2024 for highway project: Gadkari
State-owned Life Insurance Corporation (LIC) has agreed to offer ₹1.25 lakh crore line of credit by 2024 to fund government's ₹8.41 lakh crore Bharatmala Project for constructing highways, Union Minister Nitin Gadkari said. LIC has offered ₹25,000 crore in a year's time, he added. Project will be funded through toll revenue, market borrowings and insurance funds, among others, Gadkari said.
https://www.livemint.com/news/india/lic-offers-rs-1-25-tn-line-of-credit-by-2024-to-fund-highway-projects-gadkari-1563697109368.html?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts
Livemint
New Delhi: As part of innovative modes of financing to meet India's huge infrastructure appetite, insurance giant LIC has agreed to offer  ₹1.25 lakh crore line of credit by 2024, to fund highway projects, Union Minister Nitin Gadkari said.
Keen on timely execution of the  ₹8.41 lakh crore ambitious Bharatmala project that aims to lay a grid of highways pan-India, the Road Transport and Highways Ministry has been looking to harness various sources of finances including pension and insurance funds.
"LIC has offered us  ₹25,000 crore in a year and  ₹1.25 lakh crore in five years… They have agreed in principle. We will rope in these funds in highways construction," Gadkari told PTI in an interview here.
Life Insurance Corporation of India (LIC) Chairman R Kumar had called on Gadkari last week.
The Minister said that the line of credit will be used to fund the ambitious Bharatmala project, the revised cost of which has reached  ₹8.41 lakh crore.
Bhartmala was approved initially at a cost of  ₹5.35 lakh crore, which was risen later on account of land acquisition costs. In the first phase, 34,800 km including 10,000 kilometres of balance NHDP (National Highways Development Project) will be upgraded.
Gadkari said the Bharatmala programme will be funded through cess, toll revenue, market borrowings, private sector participation, insurance fund, pension funds, masala bonds and other initiatives and the LIC credit line was one such initiative.
The funds will be raised for 30 years and the interest rate will be revised every 10 years, as per initial plans.
“National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) and LIC officials will sit down and draw the modalities including finer details like interest rates, debt servicing and other details,’ said an official.
The borrowings will be in the form of bonds to be issued by the NHAI.
"We don't have dearth of funds," the Minister said adding that as the projects will be completed these will be put up for monetisation and the funds will be ploughed back to highway construction.
The NHAI is eyeing  ₹4,995 crore from monetisation of third tranche of 566 km of highways under TOT (toll, operate and transfer) model. There are nine highway stretches of 566.27 km in TOT Bundle-3 in states of Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Jharkhand and Tamil Nadu.
The first bundle under the TOT model had fetched NHAI  ₹9,682 crore. The first bundle had a total of nine stretches involving 681 km and was awarded to Macquarie.
The third auction assumes significance given that this is coming after an unsuccessful second bundle where investors quoted a discount to NHAI's base price.
Gadkari said that besides monetisation, the Ministry was also in talks with banks for funds. "Also, the Finance Ministry has given us approval to raise  ₹75,000 crore this fiscal," he said.
Gadkari said that his Ministry has shown exponential capacity to spend allocated funds in building highways, which are the backbone of the economy.
"At present we spend more than 80 per cent of the allocation on capital expenditure. We are contributing to the growth rate," he said.
Apart from various sources of financing of highway projects, we are also contemplating going into the capital market and take the money from the common people like teachers, constables, poor people and give them good interest, he said.
"We will try to give them more than 7.5 per cent to 8 per cent interest and we will use that money for construction of roads. On the one hand, we will construct the roads and on the other hand, we will give good interest to the poor people of this country," he said.
The Minister said that the aim was to build world class transport infrastructure in the country and added, work worth about  ₹11 lakh crore were awarded by his Ministry in the last five years.
"Over 57,000 km of highway projects were awarded and over 40,000 km of roads were constructed in the last five years," he said.
Also, the budget allocation for Road Transport and Highways ministry has increased by about  ₹5,000 crore, he said.

Agencies gave IL&FS good ratings despite stress flags: Audit
A Grant Thornton audit into debt-laden IL&FS Group revealed that rating agencies despite flagging financial stress before its default, continued to give it and its units "consistently high" credit ratings. It said officials of agencies including ICRA, CARE, Brickwork and India Ratings, were possibly given gifts like smartwatches and overseas sports event tickets to influence the ratings.
https://in.reuters.com/article/india-il-fs-ratings/rating-agencies-knew-of-stress-at-ilfs-but-gave-good-ratings-audit-idINKCN1UG079?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts
Reuters
MUMBAI/NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Credit rating agencies for years assigned high ratings to India’s Infrastructure Leasing & Financial Services (IL&FS) and its group companies despite its deteriorating finances, according to a special audit. 
Audit firm Grant Thornton was appointed by IL&FS’ new board to conduct the review following the government’s decision to take charge of the group after its defaults on debt obligations sparked fears of financial contagion.  
Grant Thornton reviewed the role of five credit rating agencies — Fitch group’s India Ratings and Research, the Indian affiliate of Moody’s, ICRA, Standard & Poor’s local unit Crisil, CARE Ratings and Brickwork Ratings India — which assigned 429 ratings to various IL&FS financial instruments in recent years. 
In a 105-page report, reviewed by Reuters on Saturday, Grant Thornton said the agencies raised multiple concerns on IL&FS group’s financial stress and liquidity position between June 2012 and June 2018, but continued to assign “consistently high” ratings which were only downgraded or reversed last year. 
“Various strategies deployed by the then key officials of IL&FS group and certain favours/gifts provided to rating agency officials suggest the possible reasons for consistent good ratings provided to IL&FS group,” said Grant Thornton in its report that detailed gifts or favours such as smartwatches and tickets to overseas sporting events.  
IL&FS declined to comment. India Ratings said the Grant Thornton report is based on “partial and selective source material”, adding “our ratings were based on robust and transparent analysis of relevant information”. 
Brickwork said it did not assign the highest ratings to IL&FS “because it follows robust, transparent and consistent rating methodology” and its actions were not influenced by any commercial pressures or rating withdrawal requests. 
ICRA said it will determine an appropriate course of action and was examining the report, which it said ignores the “alleged fraud perpetrated by former IL&FS management”. 
Crisil and CARE did not immediately respond to a request for comment.     
The IL&FS crisis that started last year has sparked a series of federal probes into the firm’s operations, but Grant Thornton’s report raises questions on whether rating agencies misled investors about the stress levels at other companies in India’s shadow banking sector, where new fractures are emerging. 
Dewan Housing Finance Corp, another top firm in the sector, last week warned its financial situation was dire, raising more worries about the sector’s health and signalling the crisis was far from over. 
“These instances show a glimpse into the incestuous financial services industry where quid pro quo has become the norm. The rot ... is deep and needs more cleansing,” said Shriram Subramanian, a corporate governance expert at proxy advisory firm InGovern.  
Grant Thornton’s review of communication between former IL&FS employees and ratings agencies found the company at times “used to potentially pressurize” rating firms to withdraw their assessment if the company did not receive a favourable rating. 
It also found instances where credit rating agencies would meet with IL&FS employees and then decide not to downgrade the ratings they had initially decided on, the report said. 
“It appears that various potential strategies noted above were applied to ensure favorable ratings or to avoid the rating downgrade,” Grant Thornton said. 
Highlighting “potential favours/gifts”, Grant Thornton said various key officials at rating agencies received gifts such as smartwatches, shirts and coasters. 
E-mail communication showed a former IL&FS employee had facilitated the purchase of a villa at a steep discount for the wife of a senior Fitch executive, while another had arranged football tickets for a Brickwork Ratings executive to a Real Madrid game, the report added.  
Brickwork said it had shared “a detailed response” on this specific allegation with IL&FS’ new management. Fitch in a statement said the employee involved had violated the agency’s code of conduct and was no longer employed. 
India’s market regulator has toughened regulations for credit rating agencies over the past three years to boost monitoring and bring clarity for investors. Following the IL&FS crisis, the regulator last month ordered enhanced disclosure norms for such agencies.

Pvt insurance firms paid ₹7 cr in claims to Railway passengers
Private insurance firms have paid ₹7 crore in claims under IRCTC's optional travel insurance scheme in last two years, an RTI reply revealed. In comparison, they received about ₹46 crore premium from Indian Railways and its passengers, under the scheme launched in 2016 at ₹0.92 premium per passenger. Of the amount, Railways paid ₹38.89 crore, while passengers paid ₹7.29 crore.

New Delhi: Private insurance companies received a premium of around  ₹46 crore in the last two years from railway and its passengers while making a payout of only  ₹seven crore in claims under the national transporter's travel insurance scheme, an RTI has found.
IRCTC, which is a wholly owned undertaking of the Ministry of Railways, has entered into an agreement with three private insurance companies through limited tender - Shriram General Insurance Company Ltd, ICICI Lombard General Insurance Company Ltd and Royal Sundaram General Insurance Company Ltd for its Optional Travel Insurance Scheme which was launched in September 2016 with a premium of  ₹0.92 per passenger.
This facility is for confirmed/RAC railway passengers who booked e-ticket through the official website of Indian Railway Catering & Tourism Corporation (IRCTC).
Under the scheme, a sum assured is paid to the victim/family or legal heir of the victim as the case may be in case of death/injury of reserved passengers due to train accident/untoward incidents.
While the national transporter bore the insurance premium till August 31, 2018, the cost was transferred to passengers since and the premium was revised to  ₹0.49 per passenger in October 2018.
According to the RTI reply received by Madhya Pradesh-based social activist, Chandra Shekhar Gaur, while IRCTC has paid  ₹38.89 crore to insurance companies, passengers have so far paid  ₹7.29 crore in the past two years.
The travel insurance provides a coverage of  ₹10 lakh for death and permanent total disability arising out of any train accident or other untoward incident. For permanent partial disability you get  ₹7.5 lakh. The  ₹2 lakh coverage for hospitalization expenses for injury is over and above the death or disability coverage.
Acts like accident, robbery, dacoity and other violent acts during the train journey are covered by the policy.
Insurance companies received 206 claims in the two years, while 72 were rejected.
Officials, when contacted, said claims were less in the last two years as the number of rail accidents had dipped significantly. Railway accidents have decreased from 118 in 2013-14 to 104 in 2016-17, to 73 in 2017-18 and further to 59 in 2018-19.
Railways are also carrying more passengers - there is an increase of 2.09% in the number of passengers carried by the Indian Railways during 2017-18 as compared to 2016-17 and 0.64 per cent increase in 2018-19 as compared to 2017-18.

When you create an account on social media, you are welcoming the opportunity to get trolled. Whether you like it or you don't, trolling is a part and parcel of your life on social media and if you're a celebrity or a person with over 100k followers or so, you're bound to be trolled at every step and every post. But one Bollywood celebrity who's been a favourite of the trollers is Priyanka Chopra. Whether it's her fashion choices, her MET carpet appearances or her relationship with a younger singer, Priyanka has been a favourite. But the Desi Girl has always shut down trollers like a total boss. 
Priyanka has been in Miami chilling with her mom, Madhu Chopra and beau Nick Jonas. She rang in her birthday with a four-tier cake and a fabulous party that also saw Parineeti Chopra and Anjula Acharia. But apart from her birthday bash and pictures from her yacht party, it's this one snap of Priyanka smoking a cigarette with Nick and her mom smoking a cigar that has gone viral.
The trolling began when netizens associated her 'smoking picture' with her previous statements on suffering from asthma and asking her fans not to smoke.

Check out some of the posts here: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Priyanka Chopra isn't the first celebrity to be trolled for smoking. Earlier, pictures of Mahira Khan went viral where she was spotted smoking a cigarette along with Ranbir Kapoor in San Francisco. And shortly later, a clip from an award function went viral with Mahira smoking that irked her fans. 
While we wonder if Priyanka will respond to her trollers, the diva will finally be back on the silver screen with Shonali Bose's next directorial project, The Sky Is Pink. Along with Farhan Akhtar, Zaira Wasim and Rohit Saraf, the film is slotted to release this October. Produced by Ronnie Screwvala, Siddharth Roy Kapur and PeeCee herself, the film is based on the life of late motivational speaker Aisha Chaudhary who was diagnosed with pulmonary fibrosis. She is also the author of the book, My Little Epiphanies that was published a day before her death. On the other hand, Priyanka will also be teaming up with Mindy Kaling for a project that is going to be a wedding-comedy.

Really enjoyed it, it was timely: Chief selector on Rayudu's '3D' tweet
Reacting to ex-India cricketer Ambati Rayudu's '3D glasses' tweet, BCCI chief selector MSK Prasad said he really enjoyed the ex-batsman's tweet. "It was a lovely tweet. That was sarcasm. It was timely," he said. Further, talking about not selecting Rayudu in 2019 World Cup squad, Prasad said, "Due to certain combinations, he wasn't picked. It doesn't make Selection Committee biased."

Ambati Rayudu even without featuring in the Indian team that played the World Cup 2019 has made more news than most other players. When he was not included in the primary squad but named as a back-up he put out the famous 3D tweet. Later when the selectors had to name replacement players, Rayudu was still not included and it was said that the reason could’ve been his tweet. However, selector MSK Prasad disagrees.
When Prasad announced the India squads for West Indies tour, he was asked about Rayudu who retired from all forms of the sport after the snubs. He clarified that the selection committee was only making replacement changes based on the team management’s requirements and on that basis he didn’t find a place. There was no sort of bias in the decision-making and that they too got emotional as Rayudu retired.

The chairman of selectors also mentioned that they had brought Rayudu in the ODI team based on his T20I performance amidst criticism and gave him enough opportunities to cement a spot. Moving forward based on his performance and the combination of the team he couldn’t be included in the World Cup squad.
They persisted with him even after the middle-order batsman failed the yo-yo test. He was put on a fitness program at the NCA and they made sure he cleared it at the next go to be a part of the Indian team.
“There was criticism when we picked Rayudu after his 2017-18 T20 form. When he failed the fitness test, we backed him. Due to some combinations and permutations, we didn’t pick him for the World Cup. We didn’t do anything against him,” MSK said.
Rayudu’s 3D tweet got really popular and also proved to be meme material. The common perception was that the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) officials, the team management as well as the selectors were not happy with his tweet. The Hyderabadi was one of the few Indian players who ever questioned their selection or non-selection on social media or a public platform.
However, Prasad said that he saw humour in the tweet and really enjoyed the sarcasm in it since it was timely.
“Ambati Rayudu tweet was lovely. I enjoyed it. That was sarcasm… that was really good. It was timely tweet,” he stated.

Umpire who gave England 6 overthrows in WC final admits it was a mistake
Umpire Kumar Dharmasena has admitted that awarding England six overthrows instead of five in final over of 2019 World Cup final was a mistake. "I agree...there was a judgmental error when I see it on TV replays now. But we didn't have luxury of TV replays at the ground," he said. He further said that he'll never regret the decision.

It’s been a week since the 2019 World Cup final has finished but many are still busy discussing the game. Undoubtedly, it was the best ODI game ever played and irrespective of the result, both England and New Zealand should be proud of themselves for the effort they put in. But some crunch moments decided the game eventually and one of them was the umpire Kumar Dharmasena awarding six runs to England in the last over of the chase when the ball ricocheted off Ben Stokes’ bat.
The incident took place in the final over when the home team needed nine runs off three balls and the Kiwis almost had the World Cup trophy in the bag. The batsman swatted the ball to deep mid-wicket and set off for two runs. While taking the second run, Stokes dived to avoid getting run-out only for his bat to deflect the ball to the boundary.

The on-field umpires consulted then to give England six runs when actually five runs should’ve signalled. According to the cricketing laws, the two batsmen should’ve crossed each other when the fielder threw the ball and Stokes and Adil Rashid hadn’t crossed when Martin Guptill fired in a throw. It was considered as a clear mistake by the former international umpire Simon Taufel.
Speaking about the controversial call to a Sri Lankan publication the Sunday Times, Kumar Dharmasena has cleared that he has no regrets about the decision he made regarding the overthrow. However, he also admitted that they made a judgemental error in the middle.
“It’s easy for people to comment after seeing TV replays. I agree that there was a judgmental error when I see it on TV replays now. But we did not have the luxury of TV replays at the ground and I will never regret the decision I made. Besides, the ICC praised me for the decision I made at that time,” he said.
Dharmasena also cleared that he communicated to the leg umpire Marais Erasmus before making the decision and even the other umpires agreed to give six runs to England. “There is no provision in the law to refer this to the third umpire as no dismissal was involved. So, I did consult the leg umpire through the communication system which is heard by all other umpires and the match referee.
“And, while they cannot check TV replays, they all confirmed that the batsmen have completed the run. This is when I made my decision,” the 48-year-old added.

TikTok owner ByteDance to open local data centre for Indian users
TikTok's Chinese owner ByteDance has announced plans to establish a local data centre in India. "We're now in the process of examining options for safe, secure and reliable services for our Indian users within India's borders," ByteDance said. As per a report, the local data centre will be part of $1 billion investment in India that ByteDance had announced earlier.
https://www.livemint.com/technology/apps/tiktok-owner-bytedance-to-establish-local-data-centres-for-indian-users-1563707914261.html?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts
Livemint
Chinese Internet technology company, Bytedance, has announced plans to establish local data centres in India. Bytedance is the company behind popular social media platforms TikTok and Helo. The company was recently issued a notice for these apps, by the Indian government, for allegedly misusing the platforms for “anti-national activities". The apps were warned that they might face a ban if they fail to submit appropriate responses to the questions by July 22.
“We are now in the process of examining options for safe, secure and reliable services for our Indian users within India's borders," Bytedance announced via a press release.
The move would be in line with the Indian government’s efforts towards data localisation for user data gathered from India by various companies. According to Business Standard, the investment towards local data centres will be part of the billion dollar investment in India that Bytedance had announced earlier this year. The company “has an internal target of 6-18 months" to set up the data centres, the report said.
The company also said that it has so far been storing Indian users’ data in third party servers located in the United States (US) and Singapore. The company had claimed the same earlier this month as well, when Congress MP Shashi Tharoor accused the company of collecting user data illegally and sending it to China.
“These claims are simply untrue. The privacy and security of our users is a top priority for TikTok, and we abide by local laws and regulations in the markets where we operate," the company said in a statement at the time.
Bytedance has also faced issues in the country for allegedly promoting pronographic content on its platforms. TikTok was banned in April this year, following an order by the Madras High Court, though the order was lifted later that month.

Over half a dozen unicorns created in India so far in 2019: Report
Over half a dozen unicorns (startups valued at $1 billion or more) have been created in India so far this year, as per Venture Intelligence. These include Wipro's Azim Premji-backed Icertis, grocery startup BigBasket, logistics startups Rivigo and Delhivery, software firm Druva and fantasy gaming startup Dream11. IT healthcare firm CitiusTech and Ola's Ola Electric also became unicorns this year.

Livemint
India’s coveted startup club of unicorns- firms valued at $1 billion or more, is growing faster than ever. 2019 alone has produced over half a dozen unicorns so far, with a new one just last week.
Icertis, a contract management software platform raised $115 million led by US-based venture capital firm Greycroft and Premji Invest, the family investment office of billionaire Azim Premji.
The other unicorns created this year include grocery startup BigBasket, trucking logistics firm Rivigo, ecommerce logistics firm Delhivery, software firm Druva, fantasy gaming startup Dream11, IT healthcare firm CitiusTech and Ola Electric, the electric vehicle arm spun off from ride hailing startup Ola, itself one of India’s earliest unicorns, according to data from Venture Intelligence
“The state of today's startup ecosystem has a lot to do with efforts of these early unicorns, startups which bore significant market development costs. Now add to this hugely favourable macro changes, capital supply and the maturing consumer, and you have a growing unicorn tribe," said Radha Kizhanattam, investment director at Unitus Ventures, an early stage investor.
Just halfway through the year, the list of unicorns created this year is at par with all of 2018. That was a record breaking year too, with hotelier Oyo Rooms, insurer Policybazaar, food delivery firms Swiggy and Zomato, online retailer Paytm Mallsoftware firm Freshworks, payment firm Billdesk and business-to-business marketplace Udaan all becoming unicorns.
Further, of the 25 unicorns in the country so far, 15 have been from 2018 alone, indicating the surging number of scalable firms, the data from Venture Intelligence says.
The creation of these highly valued companies stems from a massive availability of capital, keenness to deploy in India, and the global ambitions of homegrown firms.
“Investors such as Tiger Global, Softbank etc. with deeper pockets, riskier appetites, patient timelines now chasing opportunities in India on the back of early successes (Flipkart exit). Their confidence also comes from parallels on timing on trends and growth of equivalents in other economies, potentially betting on riding a similar trend in India. This in turn leading to more capital available at earlier stages given there is more visibility into potentially meaningful exits," Kizhanattam said.
The potential pipeline for unicorns also looks strong, with dozens of firms currently raising funds at unicorn valuations, or startups which are currently valued at over $500 million. These startups are emerging from well-heeled sectors such as ecommerce, fintech and logistics, as well as newer sectors such as content, social commerce and mobility.

British finance minister says he will resign if Boris becomes PM
British finance minister Philip Hammond has said he will resign from the post if Boris Johnson becomes Prime Minister. "Assuming that Boris Johnson becomes Prime Minister, I understand that his conditions for serving in his government would include accepting a no-deal Brexit on the 31st of October. That is not something I could ever sign up to," Hammond added.
https://www.reuters.com/article/us-britain-eu-hammond/uk-finance-minister-hammond-to-resign-on-wednesday-over-no-deal-brexit-idUSKCN1UG0B4?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts
Reuters
LONDON (Reuters) - British finance minister Philip Hammond said on Sunday he would resign if Boris Johnson became prime minister because he felt unable to support a leader happy to take the country out of the European Union without a deal. 
Hammond’s decision underlines the strength of feeling in parliament against a no-deal Brexit, which some lawmakers and many businesses say would be catastrophic for the economy. 
A loyal Conservative who has served in a number of ministerial roles, Hammond is an unlikely rebel. He said his fears over a no deal forced him to vote against the government for the first time in his 22-year political career last week. 
Britain’s new prime minister is tipped to be former London mayor Johnson, who has promised to leave the EU “do or die” by an Oct. 31 deadline. That leaves him facing a tricky Brexit challenge from the moment he would take office on Wednesday. 
Johnson has said he would ramp up preparations for a no deal to try to force the EU’s negotiators to make changes to the agreement that Prime Minister Theresa May sealed with Brussels and UK lawmakers voted down three times.  
But parliamentary opposition to a no deal is growing and the EU is refusing to budge over that withdrawal agreement. 
“I am sure I am not going to be sacked because I am going to resign before we get to that point,” Hammond told the BBC’s Andrew Marr Show, adding he would resign to May before she tendered her own resignation to the Queen on Wednesday. 
“Assuming that Boris Johnson becomes prime minister, I understand that his conditions for serving in his government would include accepting a no-deal (EU) exit on the 31st of October. That is not something I could ever sign up to.” 
Johnson has said his most senior ministers “would have to be reconciled” with the possibility of a no-deal Brexit on Oct. 31, a departure he does not want to see happen, but one he says must be planned for to try to increase pressure on the EU. 
That stance means several more ministers who want to leave with a deal may seek to quit before facing the prospect of being sacked by Johnson. 
Justice minister David Gauke has indicated he will also step down on Wednesday, and some lawmakers say they expect more pro-EU Conservatives to leave their positions to hold talks in parliament to find a way to prevent a no deal. 
Keir Starmer, Brexit policy chief in the main opposition Labour Party, said on Twitter he respected Hammond’s decision. 
“I want to work with all those MPs (members of parliament) who, like me, want to ensure parliament can stop a disastrous no-deal exit,” Starmer said. 
Hammond’s intention to resign led Ian Blackford, the Westminster leader of the Scottish National Party, to predict that Johnson could become “the shortest serving prime minister in history”. 
Hammond, who according to sources close to Johnson often infuriated the former mayor who felt the finance minister was “talking Britain down”, said he did not believe his former colleague could win a deal with the EU by the deadline.  
He instead advised the new prime minister to ask the EU for a little longer if there were signs that the two sides could agree on a compromise position - something Johnson’s rival for the premiership, Jeremy Hunt, has said he is open to. 
But the EU has so far been steadfast in its view that it cannot open the withdrawal agreement, and Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney said both sides would be “in trouble” if the new prime minister was intent on tearing up the deal. 
He suggested the new leader could secure changes to the political declaration on future ties to get rid of the Northern Irish backstop - an insurance policy to avoid the return of a hard border between the British province and Ireland. 
“We hope that the backstop that many in the UK don’t seem to like can be avoided,” Coveney told the BBC. “(But) we are simply not going to move away from that withdrawal agreement.” 
Johnson and his supporters say the hardline stance is little more than a negotiating ploy. But if the standoff failed to be broken and a no deal Brexit was in the offing, Hammond would become a high-profile backer of attempts in parliament to stop a no deal. 
“Yes, (I will campaign) to stop no deal happening on Oct. 31 without the consent of parliament,” Hammond said. 
“I want to be a loyal supporter of the next Conservative government and if (it).. can deliver a negotiated Brexit deal that protects our economy then I will strongly support that government. And I hope I will be able to.”

Trinamool Congress supremo Mamata Banerjee has demanded return of ballot papers in place of Electronic Voting Machines (EVMs) and said electoral reforms are required in the country to save democracy and stop the use of black money during polls. Banerjee, the chief minister of West Bengal, also demanded state funding of elections.
“Do not forget that the EVMs were earlier used in England, France, Germany and America. But they have now stopped using them…. So why cannot we bring the ballot papers back?” she said.
During Sunday’s rally, she is expected to highlight issues like EVMs and electoral reforms. “Since 1995, I have been demanding electoral reforms.

I want to know, where did all this money come from? Every party cannot spend so much money. This is corruption. Money was sent to different fake bank accounts. Money was transferred even using RTGS,” she said.

PM Modi govt has changed India, brought 'achhe din': Nadda
BJP working President JP Nadda on Sunday said that "achhe din" has arrived under PM Narendra Modi-led government and the country has changed in the last five years. He added that by saying 'Congress-mukt Bharat', the party means a country free of "corruption and commission". Nadda further said that PM Modi has changed the "political culture" of the country.

Times Now
Mumbai: Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) working president JP Nadda today said that Prime Minister Narendra Modi-led government brought "good days" in the last five years, adding that India witnessed a tremendous change in the last five years.
Issuing clarity on “Congress-mukt Bharat”, the BJP working president said that when the party talks about it, it means it wants a country free of corruption.
"'Achhe din ayenge' (good days will come) and 'Desh badal raha hai' (the country is changing) were the slogans of the BJP's campaign in 2014. We would like to remind the people that good days have arrived and the country has already changed in the last five years," PTI quoted him as saying.
Addressing the BJP's Maharashtra state executive committee meeting in Mumbai, he highlighted the Centre’s achievements in the health sector, poverty elevation, infrastructure, agriculture and rural development.
Crediting the prime minister for changing the "political culture" of the country, Nadda said that under his leadership, the party focused on the development and work at the grassroots level.
Modi's victories in 2014 and 2019 are a rejection of the vote bank and caste politics, he said, advising the BJP workers to "look globally, act locally".
Attributing India’s rising graph at the world stage to PM Modi he said that before 2014, the country was looked upon as corrupt with a foreign policy that was not only paralysed but also lacked direction. However, now the people of Indian origin living abroad feel proud to be Indians.
Pointing out at multiple awards conferred to the PM, he called it an achievement saying that countries like the UAE, Israel, Russia and Saudi Arabia recognised PM’s contribution in expanding bilateral ties.
PM Modi was recently named the world’s most admired Indian according to a survey by YouGov – a UK-based internet market research and data analytics firm.
Apart from the PM, cricketer Mahendra Singh Dhoni, industrialist Ratan Tata, star of the millennium Amitabh Bachchan, cricket legend blaster Sachin Tendulkar, Indian captain Virat Kohli, and Bollywood superstar Shah Rukh Khan also found mention in the list.
PM Narendra Modi-led BJP secured a massive victory in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections winning 303 seats on its own while the Congress under the leadership of Rahul Gandhi won 52 seats.
Rahul Gandhi himself was defeated by BJP’s Smriti Irani in his home turf Amethi.

IndiGo to seek shareholder nod for independent woman director
IndiGo operator InterGlobe Aviation has said it will seek its shareholders' approval to appoint an independent woman board director, at its Annual General Meeting. Earlier, IndiGo Co-Founder Rakesh Gangwal had alleged airline's non-compliance with SEBI's regulations for not having an independent woman director on its board. InterGlobe said it was working on answering SEBI on Gangwal's grievances.

Livemint
New Delhi: InterGlobe Aviation Ltd, which runs the country's largest airline, IndiGo, on Saturday said it will seek shareholder approval for induction of an independent woman director.
A company statement said at the end of a meeting of the board of directors here that shareholder nod will be sought at an annual general meeting for expanding the directorships to enable this.
Having a woman independent director on board was one of the several demands made by IndiGo's co-founder Rakesh Gangwal in his letter to capital market regulator Sebi earlier this month in which he claimed corporate governance lapses in the company. InterGlobe Aviation chief executive officer Ronojoy Dutta told analysts on Friday that the company was in the process of replying to Sebi on Gangwal's grievances and that comments on the issue would be offered to the ministry of corporate affairs by the end of next week.
IndiGo's statement on Saturday, however, maintained a deafening silence on Gangwal's grievances other than the issue of having a woman independent director. In an earlier statement rebutting Gangwal's charges, co-founder Rahul Bhatia's group had said that corporate governance was not about levelling baseless charges. "It is about ensuring that the company’s interests as also those of other stakeholders are protected and not harmed. Mr Gangwal fails to cite a single concrete example where any act or omission has resulted in any loss or damage to Indigo," Bhatia-controlled InterGlobe Enterprises Private Ltd had said earlier this month.

Natalie Portman to play female Thor in 'Thor: Love and Thunder'
Hollywood actress Natalie Portman will portray female Thor in the upcoming film of the franchise, titled 'Thor: Love and Thunder', the film's maker announced at San Diego Comic-Con. "That storyline is incredible, is full emotion, love and thunder and introduces for the first time female Thor," said director Taika Waititi. The film will also star Chris Hemsworth and Tessa Thompson.

Times Now
A couple of days back, it was reported that Marvel Studios is going ahead with the fourth film in Thor franchise. Earlier today at San Diego Comic-Con, Marvel Studios' chief Kevin Feige announced the full slate of Phase 4 films in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). Without a doubt, the biggest announcement amongst all the films was Thor 4 titled Thor: Love and Thunder. Being a part of the MCU's Holy Trinity that also comprised of Iron Man and Captain America, Thor is also one of the OG Avengers. With Tony and Steve gone, Thor is the biggest superhero of MCU, so it is quite natural that Thor: Love and Thunder is already the most awaited film.
With Taika Waititi, who made Thor a fan favourite with his take in Thor: Ragnarok, returning to write and direct the fourth part, Thor: Love and Thunder had garnered a massive hype but the new details that were revealed at the Comic-Con earlier today have left all the fans in a state of frenzy! Thor: Love and Thunder will star Chris Hemsworth and Tessa Thompson and will mark the return of Thor's love interest Dr Jane Foster played by Natalie Portman. 
The twist in the tale is that Jane Foster will be seen worthy of lifting Mjolnir in Thor: Love and Thunder and will take the mantle of Thor. The plot device is based on the recent comic book storyline where Thor loses his powers and Jane Foster is deemed worthy. At the Comic-Con panel, director Taika Waititi called Natalie on stage and handed her the Mjolnir in the presence of Chris Hemsworth, Tessa Thompson and thousands of fans. He said, "That storyline is incredible is full emotion, love and thunder and introduces for the first time female Thor".
Lifting the Mjolnir, Natalie was heard saying, "I’ve always had hammer envy".



In fact, Tessa Thompson's Valkyrie has been announced as the first LGBTQ hero of MCU. Taking the stage, Tessa said, "As new king (of Asgard), she needs to find her queen. That will be the first order of business." 



Thor: Love and Thunder is slated for a November 5, 2021 release. 
Apart from Thor: Love and Thunder, Kevin Feige also announced a hoard of other films like Black Widow, Eternals, Sheng-Chi and the Legend of Ten Rings, Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness and Blade and web series like WandaVision, Loki, Hawkeye, The Falcon and the Winter Soldier and What If...?

Donald Trump becoming face of 'racism and exclusion': Siemens CEO
German multinational conglomerate Siemens' CEO Joe Kaeser took to Twitter and said US President Donald Trump is becoming the face of 'racism and exclusion'. "I lived in the USA for many years and experienced freedom, tolerance and openness as never before," Kaeser said. This comes after Trump asked four female Democratic lawmakers to "go back" to where they came from.

The Financial Express
Siemens AG Chief Executive Officer Joe Kaeser said President Donald Trump is turning into a symbol of racism after telling four female Democratic lawmakers to “go back” to where they came from. Kaeser, one of Germany’s most prominent business leaders, said on Twitter he finds it depressing “that the world’s most important political office is turning into the face of racism and exclusion.”
“I lived in the USA for many years and experienced freedom, tolerance and openness as never before,” said Kaeser, whose past jobs include a stint at a Siemens unit in San Jose, California.
Kaeser, 62, was replying to a sarcastic tweet by former German lawmaker Ruprecht Polenz, who said Germany might end up having to take Trump back. One of the president’s grandfathers emigrated to the U.S. in the 1880s.
Polenz, a member of Chancellor Angela Merkel’s Christian Democratic Union party, was commenting on Trump’s campaign rally in Greenville, North Carolina, on Wednesday where his supporters directed chants of “send her back” at Representative Ilhan Omar, a Somali-born U.S. citizen from Minnesota.
Trump attempted to distance himself from the chant, though he appeared to back off his disavowal on Friday.

Blizzard Co-founder Frank Pearce quits company after 28 years
American video game developer Blizzard Entertainment's Co-founder Frank Pearce is leaving the company and his role as the Chief Development Officer. Pearce founded the company 28 years ago with Mike Morhaime and Allen Adham. Allen left in 2004 but came back in 2016 to oversee the development of new titles. Morhaime stepped down as President and CEO last year.

Another Blizzard co-founder is stepping away from the company. Just a few months after Mike Morhaime left his role as Blizzard CEO and president, his fellow founder Frank Pearce has announced that he's also hanging up his hat as Chief Development Officer. Pearce founded the gaming giant 28 years ago with Morhaime and Allen Adham, who left in 2004 but came back in 2016 to oversee the development of several new titles. 
Part of his farewell message reads:
"The time has come for me to step away from Blizzard and pass the torch to the next generation of leaders...Our efforts were always guided by well-intentioned purpose. We made games that we wanted to play, believing that like-minded people would also want to play those games. Today we characterize it more specifically with the ambitious vision of bringing the world together through epic entertainment. I am so proud to have had the chance to positively impact the lives of so many people through the experiences we have created."
Pearce didn't say what he'll be doing doing next, only mentioning that he plans to spend more time active in the outdoors, to learn to play an instrument and to ultimately devote more time to other aspects of his life. The executive was never as visible as his co-founders, starting out as a programmer for some of the company's earliest titles like Diablo and StarCraft until he took on the role as CDO.
New company president J. Allen Brack said Pearce stepped into an advisory role to help him out when he took over from Morhaime last year. "I have been lucky enough to work with J and [Ray Gresko, the company's new Chief Development Office] for many years, and now it is their responsibility to define how the adventure continues," Pearce also wrote.

US-S Korea military exercise to proceed despite N Korea's warning
The secretary for peace planning to South Korean President Moon Jae-in, Jong Kun Choi, has said a US-South Korean military exercise would go ahead as planned next month. This comes despite North Korea's warning that the exercise will put talks aimed at getting the country to abandon its nuclear weapons at risk. "The nature of exercise isn't offensive," Choi said.
https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-southkorea-military/u-s-south-korean-military-exercise-to-proceed-top-south-korean-official-idUSKCN1UF0OV?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts
Reuters
ASPEN, Colo. (Reuters) - A top South Korean official on Saturday said a U.S.-South Korean military exercise would go ahead as planned next month, denying Pyongyang’s charges that holding it would breach an agreement made between U.S. President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. 
“The nature of the exercise is not offensive ... and is for strengthening the alliance,” Choi Jong-kun, the secretary for peace planning to South Korean President Moon Jae-in, told the Aspen Institute’s annual strategic forum. 
Later, speaking with Reuters, Choi said next month’s exercise would largely involve computer simulations and not troops in the field. 
The spokesman for North Korea’s Foreign Ministry said on Tuesday that Trump had reaffirmed in a meeting with Kim last month that joint exercises would be halted adding that the U.S. decision to proceed with them was “clearly a breach” of the leaders’ agreements made at a summit in Singapore last year. 
The spokesman said proceeding with war games was jeopardizing Pyongyang’s resumption of nuclear talks with the United States. The ministry said Washington’s pattern of “unilaterally reneging on its commitments” was leading Pyongyang to its commitment to discontinue tests of nuclear weapons and intercontinental ballistic missiles. 
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo rejected the North Korean charges earlier this week. 
Speaking to the Aspen conference, Choi said that the United States would have consulted with his government had Trump agreed to suspend U.S.-South Korean war games during his talks last month with Kim on the border last month. 
“As far as I know, President Trump did not promise the cancellation of this upcoming military exercise,” said Choi. “If he had done that ... we would have been consulted and organized it and used it very strategically.” 
He noted that the United States and South Korea had suspended a large-scale exercise and canceled a second following the Singapore summit in June 2018 at which Trump sought to persuade Kim to end the development of nuclear weapons and eliminate his arsenal.  
A second Trump-Kim summit in February failed to make any headway. The following month, the U.S. and South Korean militaries announced they were scaling back major war games - which Pyongyang long has denounced as preparations for war - and would hold smaller-scale exercises. 
Even so, Choi said, the preparedness of the U.S. and South Korean military to operate together had not been waned. 
“For the record, military interoperability has never been compromised,” he said.

Iran releases video of British-flagged oil tanker's capture
Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps has released a video showing British-flagged oil tanker Stena Impero's capture. The video shows speedboats pulling up alongside the tanker, and troops wearing ski masks and carrying machine guns being lowered onto its deck from a helicopter. The same tactics were used by British Royal Marines to seize an Iranian oil tanker two weeks ago.
https://www.reuters.com/article/us-mideast-iran-tanker/britain-calls-ship-seizure-hostile-act-as-iran-releases-video-of-capture-idUSKCN1UF03G?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts
Reuters
GENEVA/LONDON (Reuters) - Britain on Saturday denounced Iran’s seizure of a British-flagged oil tanker in the Gulf as a “hostile act” and rejected Tehran’s explanation that it seized the vessel because it had been involved in an accident. 
Iran’s Revolutionary Guards posted a video online showing speedboats pulling alongside the Stena Impero tanker, its name clearly visible. Troops wearing ski masks and carrying machine guns rappelled to its deck from a helicopter, the same tactics used by British Royal Marines to seize an Iranian tanker off the coast of Gibraltar two weeks ago. 
Friday’s action in the global oil trade’s most important waterway has been viewed in the West as a major escalation after three months of confrontation that has already taken Iran and the United States to the brink of war. 
It follows threats from Tehran to retaliate for Britain’s July 4 seizure of the Iranian tanker Grace 1, accused of violating sanctions on Syria. 
British Defence Secretary Penny Mordaunt called the incident a “hostile act”. Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt said he had expressed “extreme disappointment” by phone to his Iranian counterpart, Mohammad Javad Zarif. Britain also summoned the Iranian charge d’affaires in London. 
A spokesman for Iran’s Revolutionary Guards, Brigadier-General Ramezan Sharif, said Tehran had seized the ship in the Strait of Hormuz despite the “resistance and interference” of a British warship which had been escorting it. No British warship was visible in the video posted by the Guards. 
Iran’s Fars news agency said the Guards had taken control of the Stena Impero on Friday after it collided with an Iranian fishing boat whose distress call it ignored. 
The vessel, carrying no cargo, was taken to the Iranian port of Bandar Abbas. It will remain there with its 23 crew - 18 of them Indians - while the accident is investigated, Iranian news agencies quoted the head of Ports and Maritime Organisation in southern Hormozgan province, Allahmorad Afifipour, as saying. 
In a letter to the U.N. Security Council, Britain said the tanker was approached by Iranian forces when it was in Omani territorial waters exercising its lawful right of passage, and the action “constitutes illegal interference.” 
“Current tensions are extremely concerning, and our priority is to de-escalate. We do not seek confrontation with Iran,” the letter said. “But it is unacceptable and highly escalatory to threaten shipping going about its legitimate business through internationally recognized transit corridors.” 
Zarif told Hunt that the ship must go through a legal process before it can be released, Iran’s ISNA news agency reported. 
The strait, between Iran and the Arabian peninsula, is the sole outlet for exports of most Middle Eastern oil, and the seizure sent oil prices sharply higher. The United States, which tightened sanctions against Iran in May with the aim of halting its oil exports altogether, has been warning for months of an Iranian threat to shipping in the strait. 
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said he also discussed the situation with Hunt, his British counterpart. 
“We talked about what they’ve seen, what they know, and how they’re beginning to think about how they will respond,” Pompeo said in an interview with the Washington Examiner that was published on Saturday by the State Department. “Iran is in a place today that they have taken themselves.” 
Another oil tanker, the Mesdar, was also boarded by Iranian personnel on Friday and temporarily forced to divert toward Iran, but later was allowed to continue on its route through the strait. On Saturday Algeria’s APS news agency said the Mesdar was owned by Algeria’s state oil company Sonatrach. 
France, Germany and the European Union joined Britain in condemning the seizure. 
The three big European countries are signatories to a 2015 nuclear deal between Tehran and world powers that Washington undermined by quitting last year, setting Iran’s already fragile relations with the West on a downward spiral. 
Under the pact, Iran agreed to restrict nuclear work in return for lifting sanctions. The European countries opposed the Trump administration’s decision to abandon the agreement last year, but have so far failed to fulfill promises to Iran of providing alternative means for it to access world trade.
