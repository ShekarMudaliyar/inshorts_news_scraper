17,US Navy shoots down Iranian drone in Strait of Hormuz,"US President Donald Trump on Thursday said that a US Navy ship had ""destroyed"" an Iranian drone in the Strait of Hormuz after the aircraft threatened the vessel. He added that the drone had flown to within 1,000 yards of the ship and had ignored ""multiple calls to stand down"". Iran in June shot down a US military surveillance drone.",Reuters,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States said on Thursday that a U.S. Navy ship had “destroyed” an Iranian drone in the Strait of Hormuz after the aircraft threatened the vessel, but Iran said it had no information about losing a drone.     In the latest episode to stir tensions in the Gulf, U.S. President Donald Trump told an event at the White House that the drone had flown to within 1,000 yards (meters) of the USS Boxer and had ignored “multiple calls to stand down.” “This is the latest of many provocative and hostile actions by Iran against vessels operating in international waters. The United States reserves the right to defend our personnel, facilities and interests,” Trump said.     “The drone was immediately destroyed,” he added. Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif told reporters at the United Nations: “We have no information about losing a drone today.” The Pentagon said in a statement that the USS Boxer, an amphibious assault ship, had taken “defensive action” against a drone on Thursday morning as the Boxer was moving into the Strait of Hormuz.  “We do assess it was an Iranian drone,” said Commander Rebecca Rebarich, a Pentagon spokeswoman.   Tensions in the Gulf region are high, with fears that the United States and Iran could stumble into war. The United States has blamed Iran for a series of attacks since mid-May on shipping around the Strait of Hormuz, the world’s most important oil artery. Tehran rejects the allegations. Iran in June shot down a U.S. military surveillance drone in the Gulf with a surface-to-air missile. Iran says the drone was in its airspace, but Washington says it was in international skies. Trump said at the time the United States had come close to launching a military strike on Iran in retaliation for the downing of the U.S. drone.    The increased use of drones by Iran and its allies for surveillance and attacks across the Middle East is raising alarms in Washington.  The United States believes that Iran-linked militia in Iraq have recently increased their surveillance of American troops and bases in the country by using off-the-shelf, commercially available drones, U.S. officials say. A U.S. official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the drone on Thursday was brought down through electronic jamming.  Tension in the Strait of Hormuz: tmsnrt.rs/32tzK6J Relations between the United States and Iran have worsened since last year when Trump abandoned a 2015 deal between world powers and Iran in which Tehran agreed to restrict nuclear work in return for the lifting of sanctions.     The United States has reimposed sanctions to throttle Iran’s oil trade and says it wants to increase pressure on Tehran to renegotiate the accord, discuss its ballistic missile program and modify its behavior in the Middle East, where Washington is allied to several Arab states opposed to Iran. Iran’s clerical rulers have ruled out renegotiating the nuclear deal or holding talks on its missile program, which it says is purely defensive.  But Zarif told reporters on Thursday that Iran had offered to make a concession on its nuclear program - to ratify a document prescribing more intrusive inspections - if the United States abandoned its economic sanctions - a proposal that drew U.S. skepticism. “If Iran wants to make a serious gesture, it should start by ending uranium enrichment immediately,” a U.S. senior administration official said, adding any talks should include “a permanent end to Iran’s malign nuclear ambitions, including its development of nuclear-capable missiles.”  Earlier on Thursday, the United States demanded Iran immediately release a vessel it seized in the Gulf, and a U.S. military commander in the region said the United States would work “aggressively” to ensure free passage of vessels through the vital waterway.     Iran played down the seizure of the ship, which it said was a small vessel that was smuggling oil. Iranian state TV aired footage of a vessel called “RIAH.”   The Panamanian-flagged oil tanker MT Riah disappeared off trackers in Iranian territorial waters days ago.  “We do this (inspecting ships) every day. These are people who smuggle our oil,” Iran’s Press TV quoted Zarif as saying, adding: “It was a small ship used to smuggle 1 million liters – not 1 million barrels – of crude oil.”      Washington has recently beefed up its military presence and the U.S. Fifth Fleet, based in Bahrain, says that Gulf Arab states have stepped up patrols. Revolutionary Guards Commander-in-Chief Hossein Salami said on Thursday that Iran had adopted a defensive strategy, but warned that “if our enemies make any mistakes ... our strategy can become an offensive one.” Oil prices jumped on Thursday after news of the ship seizure. They later fell, however, on weakness in U.S. equities markets and an expectation that crude output would rise in the Gulf of Mexico following last week’s hurricane in the region.    The United States on Thursday imposed sanctions on an international network of companies and their agents it said were involved in the procurement of materials for Iran’s nuclear program.

X2 Games, created by Atari co-founder Nolan Bushnell and Hollywood creative director Zai Ortiz, has released an Alexa-powered board game entitled St. Noire. And, yes, it's exclusively available through Amazon. To be clear, you won't be hearing Alexa's robotic voice when you play the game, so you don't have to worry about the assistant ruining your immersion. The technology simply powers the game's immersive background sounds and cinematic voice performances, which are made up of over 2,500 lines of dialogue performed by actors portraying 12 different characters. The game randomizes the identity of the killer and the victim every playthrough to keep things fresh. As the hard-boiled detective solving the mystery, you'll have to visit various locations (including seedy bars, of course) in the game to talk to characters. Not everyone will be telling you the truth, obviously, so you'll have to find inconsistencies in their statement and piece clues together to find the culprit.Ortiz said they were really excited with the prospect of ""gamifying voice technology by fusing cinematic storytelling with board games."" He added: ""By incorporating voice-control mechanics into the traditional tabletop format, we are transforming the board game landscape, as well as pushing the boundaries of what Smart Speaker gaming means.""St. Noire is now available on Amazon for $40, but that doesn't include the Alexa device itself. We hope you got an Alexa device during Prime Day if you're a murder mystery fan looking to give this a try. In the coming days, the game will also debut at San Diego Comic Con, where Bushnell and Ortiz will be speaking about it and ""gamification technology' as the future of gaming.",https://www.engadget.com/2019/07/18/st-noire-alexa-detective-board-game/?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

""But that doesn't mean that other captains have done badly. Sourav Ganguly has done good captaincy; we have won outside under him. Under Virat Kohli's captaincy, we have won ODI series in South Africa and Test series in Australia,"" he added.",CricTracker,"Former India opener Gautam Gambhir is known for his sharp analysis and he never minces a word while putting forth his viewpoints. The 37-year-old, who has now become an MP after contesting the general elections this year after quitting the game, recently said that there are Indian captains who have done better than MS Dhoni. He cited the names of Sourav Ganguly, Anil Kumble and Virat Kohli as captains who have led India to glorious feats and added that it is not right to give all credits for success to the captain and blame him when otherwise.Dhoni is India’s most successful captain as per the statistician’s book. He has led India in 60 Tests, 200 ODIs and 72 T20Is and won 27, 110 and 41 games, respectively. While nobody is there close to him as of yet (among the current captains like Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma who replaces the former) in the limited formats, Kohli is just one Test short of equalling Dhoni’s record of 27 wins. He will better Dhoni’s record wins in Tests if India win 2-0 against the West Indies in the upcoming series in the Caribbeans.Advertisement“If you see the statistics, then he (Dhoni) is the best captain. But that doesn’t mean that other captains have done badly. Sourav Ganguly has done good captaincy; we have won outside under him. Under Virat Kohli’s captaincy, we have won ODI series in South Africa and Test series in Australia.It is true that MS Dhoni has won us two World Cups (2007 and 2011) but it is not fair to give all credit to the captain for success and criticise only him when it doesn’t go your way. Dhoni has won the Champions Trophy and World Cups but other captains have also taken India forward. Captains like Anil Kumble have done the job though not for long; Rahul Dravid also led India to win in England,” he said in an exclusive interview to TV9.Gambhir had once said in the past that the best captain under who he has played is Kumble. He also said that with different captains winning and losing in different countries, it is difficult to judge who is better than whom.

Trent Boult misjudged a catch from Ben Stokes and he landed on the boundary rope with the ball in his hand in the penultimate over of the match. And then, in the final over that he bowled, a deflection off Stokes’ bat hurt them as it was sent for four overthrows, turning the game in favour of the hosts.Boult returned to his country on Thursday with some of his colleagues and is yet to get over the pain of losing the title clash by the count of boundary – a rule that many had found bizarre. The 29-year-old left-arm pacer even tendered an apology, saying he was “sorry for letting everybody down” in relation to the final loss. He was also upset that he had gone for a six in the final over. Twelve runs in two deliveries brought England back into the game and the match ended in a tie after England scored 241 while chasing a target of 242.Advertisement“It’s been a long flight home but it [the defeat] probably hasn’t sunk in yet. I wish it would, so we can all get over it but it’s one of those things that we probably won’t get over for a long time,” Boult, who took 17 wickets from 10 matches in the World Cup, told reporters after reaching Auckland. “We’ve just been on a plane 15 hours and there were a lot of Kiwis saying ‘we felt for you’. I didn’t really know what to say.”He even said that he would want to walk his dog on the beach in a bid to forget the experience and termed it something that will be difficult to forget even over a few years.“Obviously, we’re all hurting and we’re sorry for letting everyone down. I just want to get home, walk my dog along the beach and try to forget about it but it’s gonna be a hard one to swallow for the next couple of years,” the Kiwi pacer said.New Zealand’s only big consolation is that their captain Kane Williamson was picked as the Player of the Tournament.",https://www.crictracker.com/trent-boult-tenders-apology-for-letting-everybody-down-in-world-cup-2019-final/?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

""I wish the selectors had asked me as well about my plans so I would also have been able to inform them,"" he added.",Times Now,"Soon after Men in Blue lost to New Zealand in semi-finals of ICC World Cup 2019, fans were waiting with bated breath to see whether former Indian captain MS Dhoni hangs his boots. While 50-over World Cup was said to be Dhoni’s last assignment in the showpiece event, speculations are rife that he might have played his last match in India colours. As the selection committee meets on July 19 to announce India’s squad for the upcoming tour to West Indies, former experts have shared their views on whether Dhoni should finally retire from all formats of the game.When asked about his take on Dhoni’s future, former Indian cricketer Virender Sehwag, who played under Dhoni’s captaincy, opined that the Ranchi cricketer has the right to take a call on his retirement. The Nawab of Nazafgarh further opined that MSK Prasad should reach out to Dhoni to talk about his future if they are not seeing him as the first-choice wicketkeeper-batsman going forward.“It should be left to MS Dhoni to decide when to hang his boots. The duty of the selectors is to reach out to Dhoni and inform him that he is no more being seen as India’s wicket-keeper batsman going forward. I wish the selectors had asked me as well about my plans so I would also have been able to inform them,” Sehwag said during a panel discussion.While Sehwag took an indirect dig at Sandeep Patil, the then chief selector, who was also on the panel, in his defense, said, “The responsibility to talk to Sachin about his future was given to me and Rajinder Singh Hans while the same responsibility was given to Vikram Rathore for Sehwag. We had asked him and he said he had spoken with Sehwag. But if Sehwag is saying that Vikram did not talk to him, I would like to take responsibility for the same.”Sehwag, who never hesitates in speaking his mind, immediately replied, “Vikram Rathore spoke to me after I was dropped. It would have made sense if he spoke to me before that. There’s no point talking to a cricketer once he is dropped. If MSK Prasad speaks to Dhoni after he is dropped, what would Dhoni say – that he would play first-class cricket and the selectors should pick him if he scores runs. The point is that the selectors should reach out to cricketers before they are dropped.”It has also been reported that the selectors now see Dhoni as a mentor who can groom Rishabh Pant to fit into his shoes going forward.",https://www.timesnownews.com/sports/cricket/article/on-ms-dhoni-s-retirement-speculations-virender-sehwag-breaks-his-silence/455776?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

The video quickly went viral on social media. An eyewitness, Sonu Shinde, told a daily that he was on his way to work when he saw the train halt in between the two stations and the motorman alight from the train. As the motorman got down from the locomotive, Shinde decided to capture the incident. According to reports, the train had stopped midway without any technical snag or any red signal.Later, it was revealed that the motorman had decided to step down from the train to urinate. Meanwhile, the Central Railway has said that it would be examining the video for its authenticity. Incidentally, in November last year, a similar incident had taken place when an assistant loco pilot stopped a long-distance AC train between Nalasopara and Vasai stations and urinated on the railway tracks.

The man had lost his leg in an attack in Albania.",The Guardian,"A man in France has lodged a complaint after claiming an image of his amputated leg was used as a health warning on tobacco packets across the EU without his permission.The 60-year-old man, who lives in Metz, eastern France, claims a picture displayed on a packet of rolling tobacco alongside the message “smoking clogs your arteries” is of his leg.The tobacco was bought in Luxembourg by his son who said he recognised in the picture the burns and scars of his father’s leg, according to reports in French media.The European commission, which is responsible for the graphic images of smoking-induced disease on cigarette packets, rejected the claim, saying any similarity was purely coincidental.Under a 2014 law all cigarettes and rolling tobacco sold in the EU must carry a warning of the health problems caused by smoking, which should consist of text and a photograph covering at least 65% of packaging.The European commission says every person depicted in its library of 42 images signed a consent form. “We can confirm that the individual mentioned is not depicted in the library of health warnings,” said a European commission spokesperson for health and food safety.Antoine Fittante, a lawyer for the complainant, said: “We will have no trouble to prove that this is my client.” He said he had written to the commission and to a French hospital said to have taken a photograph of his client’s leg. “My client feels betrayed, wounded in his dignity to see his disability on cigarette packets in tobacco shops. One must admit this isn’t very nice.”His unnamed client lost his leg in 1997 after an attack in his native Albania. Six weeks before the apparent discovery on the tobacco packet last year, the man visited a hospital in France where a photograph of his leg was taken.According to the commission, the current crop of 42 pictures was chosen in 2014 following consultations with lawyers to check consent declarations. The photographs are used on a rotating basis to prevent the images from losing their shock value.“Any similarity to other individuals not having given consent, however unfortunate, is purely coincidental,” states a commission document on the policy.… we have a small favour to ask.

42,Boeing to pay ₹340 crore to 737 MAX crash victims' families,US planemaker Boeing on Wednesday said it will dedicate $50 million (more than ₹340 crore) of the $100 million fund it created after two crashes of its 737 MAX planes to provide payments to families of those killed. The crashes killed 346 people. The world's largest planemaker has hired veteran US compensation expert Ken Feinberg to oversee the distribution.,Reuters,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Boeing Co said on Wednesday it will dedicate half of a $100 million fund it created after two crashes of its 737 MAX planes to provide payments to families of those killed, with veteran U.S. compensation expert Ken Feinberg hired by the world’s largest plane maker to oversee the distribution. The announcement of Feinberg’s hiring came minutes before a U.S. House of Representatives hearing featuring dramatic testimony by Paul Njoroge, a father who lost three children, his wife and mother-in-law in a 737 MAX Ethiopian Air crash in March. Feinberg told Reuters his team will “start immediately drafting a claims protocol for those eligible,” with the first meeting with officials from Chicago-based Boeing later this week in Washington. Feinberg has administered many compensation funds including for victims of the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks on the United States, the 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill, General Motors ignition switch crashes and numerous school shootings. The 737 MAX, Boeing’s best-selling jet, was grounded globally in March following the Ethiopian Airlines crash after a similar Lion Air disaster in Indonesia in October. The two crashes killed 346 people. Njoroge, 35, told reporters after he testified he did not think the public would trust Boeing going forward. “Do you want to fly in those planes? Do you want your children to fly in those planes?” Njoroge asked. “I don’t have any more children.” Njoroge told a House subcommittee he still has “nightmares about how (his children) must have clung to their mother crying” during the doomed flight. Njoroge, who was born in Kenya and lives in Canada, said Boeing has blamed “innocent pilots who had no knowledge and were given no information of the new and flawed MCAS system that could overpower pilots.” Boeing did not address specific questions raised by Njoroge but said in a statement “we truly regret the loss of lives in both of these accidents and we are deeply sorry for the impact to the families and loved ones of those on board.” A Boeing official told Reuters last month that after a new software flaw emerged the company will not submit an MCAS software upgrade and training revision until September, which means the planes will not resume flying until November at the earliest. U.S. airlines have cancelled flights through early November as a result of the 737 MAX’s grounding. Boeing shares closed up 1.9% Wednesday. Acting FAA Administrator Dan Elwell told Fox Business Network on Wednesday that the agency has made a lot of progress since the plane’s grounding. “We have discovered some anomalies and then we have directed Boeing to mitigate those anomalies,” Elwell said, declining to set any timetable for returning the plane to service.  “The 737 MAX is not going to fly until it passes the most thorough and intense look,” said Elwell, adding that he had spent several hours with Njoroge during a recent meeting. Boeing said on July 3 it would give $100 million over multiple years to local governments and non-profit organizations to help families and communities affected by the crashes in Indonesia and Ethiopia. Feinberg, who will jointly administer the fund with lawyer Camille Biros, said the other $50 million in the fund was  earmarked for government and community projects.  Boeing reiterated on Wednesday that the money distributed through the fund would be independent from the outcome of any lawsuits. The company is facing a slew of litigation from the families of victims of both crashes. “Through our partnership with Feinberg and Biros, we hope affected families receive needed assistance as quickly and efficiently as possible,” Boeing Chief Executive Dennis Muilenburg said in a statement. Boeing’s initial announcement of the $100 million fund was met with anger by some victims’ families, who described the offer as a publicity stunt. At the hearing in Washington, Representative Peter DeFazio, chairman of the House Transportation Committee, said he would call Boeing officials to testify at a hearing. DeFazio said the committee was in the middle of an in-depth investigation and had just received a “trove” of documents that panel investigators were reviewing.

43,Knew Neymar wanted to leave before Copa: PSG manager Tuchel,"French side Paris Saint-Germain manager Thomas Tuchel said he was aware that Neymar ""wanted to leave"" the club before Copa America. ""I am always disappointed when a player turns up late but it's clear between us, now it's between the club and Neymar,"" Tuchel added. This comes amid reports of Neymar being linked with a return to former club, Barcelona.",Times Now,"There's no bigger player than Neymar which is being discussed in the current transfer market. The Paris Saint-Germain forward has been seen flirting with former club Barcelona hoping to return to Camp Nou but the sort of money that is required to avail his services is making things difficult for the Spanish outfit. Although the Brazilian hasn't publicly expressed his intentions of leaving France, manager Thomas Tuchel has revealed that he has been aware of the player's willingness to leave even before the Copa America 2019 started.Quite possibly giving their best attempt towards signing Neymar, Barca had reportedly offered Ousmane Dembele, Philippe Coutinho and EUR 40 million to sign their former forward but the attempt has been rebuffed by the Ligue 1 champions, who, as per media reports, are only interested in signing the player for cash.Amid such a situation where the player doesn't want to remain a part of the club, but is finding it increasingly difficult to force his way out, the biggest headache lies on the head of the manager - whose job is to get the best out of the player despite the fact that he is unsettled at the club.Tuchel, who arrived in France last season, said that the topic will be discussed between the club and the player. As far as the German is concerned, things have already been made all clear.""I knew that he wanted to go before the Copa America, but it's a topic between the club and Neymar,"" Tuchel was quoted as saying.""It's all clear between us, now it's up to the club and Neymar.""We work together, it's something between the club and him.""Neymar seems to be on the move but there aren't many clubs in the world that can afford him. The 27-year-old had arrived at PSG in 2017 in a EUR 222 million move but the French giants' inability to progress as a competitive side has left him frustrated.In case a return to Barcelona falls through, Neymar might look to try his luck with one of the other big clubs, including Barcelona's arch-rivals Real Madrid - who seem to have the wherewithal to cater to PSG's demands.Neymar wasn't a part of the PSG side that defeated Dynamo Dresden 6-1 in a pre-season friendly on Tuesday. Last season's top-scorer Kylian Mbappe scored a brace for the team while Julian Draxler also found the net in the convincing victory.While the league has been a cakewalk for PSG for the past few seasons, it's the Champions League where they would be put to test again, especially if Neymar manages to leave.",https://www.timesnownews.com/sports/football/article/knew-neymar-wanted-to-leave-psg-even-before-copa-america-2019-thomas-tuchel/455144?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

When asked which aspect of India took the most time adjusting to, Schwenk said, ""The Indian 'head bob' did take me some time to get used to."" He added he finds Indians to be very friendly and competent.",Livemint,"Martin Schwenk likes to keep his expectations of the unknown to the minimum. This way, he finds himself being pleasantly surprised, something that proved to be true even when he moved to Pune with his wife in late 2018.The 53-year-old German managing director and chief executive of Mercedes-Benz India, who calls France home, is a true-blue expat, what with his job taking him to Germany, the US, Austria and South Africa. “I have always been curious about venturing into new things and countries. It instilled a feeling of always looking for more,"" he says.Moving inSchwenk doesn’t believe in pre-conceived notions before setting off on a new adventure. “Before you move, your perception is made by the press, photos, people around you. I have always found the reality very different when you actually start living in the place."" Schwenk had never been to India before and knew from experience that each place in the world is interesting when you don’t know what to expect. “You will always find something you like and you will find something that you don’t like about each place. It’s part of life,"" he says. Having said that, he adds, he was expecting India to be “Incredible India"", and a melting pot of cultures, colours, spices and people. “I don’t want to say something for the sake of pleasing, but I find Indians from all walks of life extremely approachable,"" Schwenk says.“The language barrier isn’t as high as it is in some other countries I’ve lived in."" He believes that people in India go out of their way to understand and accommodate people even without being able to speak a common language. The friendliness and welcoming nature were a pleasant surprise to him, and unlike anything he has experienced before. This trait made it easy for Schwenk to adapt to his new workplace easily too.“I find Indians to be very friendly and competent. Another thing I saw here was that my colleagues are very curious. They are always looking to develop, whether it is themselves or the business,"" points out Schwenk. He believes their positive spirit and can-do attitude is almost infectious, and made his new start much easier.He began his stint in India by taking the time out to listen and learn. He also believes in respecting his colleagues’ history and way of working, and assumes they are good at what they do. Does that mean his way of working is democratic? “Democratic is a big word, isn’t it? I simply listen to everything they have to say, and challenge their thoughts on the basis of my own experiences. Then we get into an open creative dialogue. In the end, we arrive at whatever works best as the next step.""Life in a new countryWhen asked which aspect of India took the most time adjusting to, Schwenk says, “I’ll admit that the Indian ‘head bob’ (moving the head in a way that could mean a ‘yes’ as well as a ‘no’) did take me some time to get used to. I also don’t understand what people mean by the incessant honking."" On a more serious note, he believes the infrastructure in India could do with some improvement, although he is already seeing the government take some concrete steps. There needs to be “enforcement of rules"" coupled with awareness and stricter laws, he says.Home sweet homeSchwenk manages to get through most weekends without frequently checking his work-related emails. “My colleagues need to find other ways to reach me if they need to,"" he laughs. He loves reading, cooking, eating Indian food and discovering new restaurants with his wife, or taking the occasional weekend trips out of town.“I used to love cycling in the woods back home in France. Unfortunately, I find the traffic a little chaotic here, so I make do by cycling in the gym."" The one thing he misses about home the most is having his entire family together. His three children all study in universities around the world, but he is thankful for technology that helps him stay in constant touch with them.Moving onWhen the time comes for him to move from India, Schwenk is certain he will miss the people most of all. Whether he will extend his stay depends on what he accomplishes in his time here. “I like it here, and so does my wife. I have no reason to think that I have to disappear after my three years here. The job is interesting, the market and the country are big and I’m sure even after three years there will be a lot of challenges. If there are any left, I might as well stay here,"" he says.Expat Speak asks foreign nationals living in India what clicks and what irks them about the work culture of the country.Write to us at businessoflife@livemint.com ",https://www.livemint.com/mint-lounge/business-of-life/-i-find-indians-to-be-very-friendly-and-competent-1563380248653.html?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

In the video, one of the two can be heard saying a dialigue against the IG, threatening him to mend his ways or face the consequences.Though it is unknown when exactly the video was shot, sources indicate that it was shot outside a function hall, when the HM and his family had come to attend a marriage function last weekend.Recently, the Mumbai cyber cell filed a case against Tik Tok users for allegedly recording a video where they were apparently seen trying to instigate revenge for the death of Tabrez Ansari, a Muslim man who was lynched in Jharkhand last month, which led to his death.Ansari was tied to an electricity pole and beaten for over seven hours. He was also forced to chant ‘Jai Shri Ram’ and ‘Jai Hanuman’ while his assaulters thrashed him with sticks.In April, a 19-year-old man in Delhi was shot dead by his friend while they were recording a Tik Tok video and posed with a pistol.

56,UK woman fined ₹73L for behaviour that lead RAF jets to escort plane,"A UK woman has been fined £85,000 (over ₹73 lakh) by the airline Jet2 over ""abusive and dangerous behaviour"" on a flight in June. Her behaviour had prompted the Turkey-bound plane to be escorted back to the UK by two Royal Air Force (RAF) Typhoon fighter jets. Chloe Haines had tried to open the aircraft door and storm the cockpit.",The Guardian,"A passenger who allegedly caused two RAF jets to be scrambled to escort a plane back to Stansted airport has been sent a bill for £85,000 by the airline. Chloe Haines has been accused by Jet2 of a “catalogue of aggressive, abusive and dangerous behaviour” on a flight bound for Dalaman in Turkey in June, including trying to open the aircraft doors during the flight. The 25-year-old was said to have been restrained by both crew and customers while the two Typhoon fighter jets chaperoned the plane back to Stansted. Two fighter aircraft caused a sonic boom as they flew to meet the plane and escort it on 22 June. Haines, of Maidenhead in Berkshire, was arrested by Essex police upon landing on suspicion of assault, criminal damage and endangering an aircraft. The force said previously she had been bailed until 30 July. But Jet2 said in a statement she has been hit with both an £85,000 bill and a lifetime ban from the airline. Steve Heapy, chief executive of Jet2.com and Jet2holidays, said: “Miss Haines’ behaviour was one of the most serious cases of disruptive passenger behaviour that we have experienced. “She must now face up to the consequences of her actions, and we will vigorously pursue to recover the costs that we incurred as a result of this divert, as we do with all disruptive passengers. “As a family-friendly airline, we take an absolutely zero tolerance approach to disruptive behaviour, and we hope that this sobering incident, with its very serious consequences, provides a stark warning to others who think that they can behave in this fashion.”… we have a small favour to ask.

58,Trump was involved in talks to pay pornstar to hide affair: FBI,"US President Donald Trump was directly involved in the talks to pay pornstar Stormy Daniels to hide their alleged affair, the FBI has said. Trump's then-campaign Press Secretary Hope Hicks was also involved in the talks. Daniels had claimed that she was paid $130,000 by Trump's former lawyer Michael Cohen during the 2016 election campaign to maintain her silence.",The Guardian,"Donald Trump and his press secretary were directly involved in discussions that led to an illegal hush-money payment to Stormy Daniels during the 2016 election campaign, according to the FBI.A court filing unsealed on Thursday said Trump and Hope Hicks spoke repeatedly with Michael Cohen, Trump’s longterm legal fixer, in October 2016 as Daniels – also known as Stephanie Clifford – threatened to sell her story of an affair with Trump.“I believe that at least some of these communications concerned the need to prevent Clifford from going public,” an FBI agent wrote, in an application for a search warrant.Cohen later admitted to making payments totalling $280,000 through a shell company to buy the silence of Daniels and the former Playboy model Karen McDougal, who also alleged she had an affair with Trump.The new disclosures raise the possibility that Hicks lied to the FBI. Hicks told an agent in an interview that “she did not learn about the allegations made by Clifford until early November 2016”, the new filings said. Hicks, who is now a senior executive at Rupert Murdoch’s Fox Corporation, has denied wrongdoing.The filings were released at the federal court in Manhattan, where Cohen pleaded guilty last year to campaign finance and personal financial crimes. Cohen began a three-year sentence in federal prison in May this year.I believe that at least some of these communications concerned the need to prevent Clifford from going publicThey said Trump and Hicks had a four-minute call with Cohen on the evening of 8 October 2016, a day after the leak of an NBC recording of Trump boasting that he grabbed women by their genitals, as an effort to silence Daniels apparently began.Cohen had not spoken with Hicks for weeks beforehand and typically only had a call with Trump about once a month, according to the agent, who said Cohen and Hicks “spoke again for about two minutes” soon after the call with Trump.Following the calls with Trump and Hicks, Cohen embarked on a flurry of calls and texts with executives at American Media, the publisher of the National Enquirer, which later admitted helping Trump cover up hush-money payments.Numerous additional text messages, calls and frantic discussions between Cohen and others about the payoff to Daniels were detailed in the filings. Cohen “spoke to Trump for approximately five minutes” on 28 October, the day the payment was finalised, according to the FBI.The filings were unsealed after Judge William Pauley disclosed on Wednesday that federal investigators had ended their inquiry into Trump’s hush-money payments to two women who alleged they had extramarital affairs with him.Prosecutors therefore appear to have decided against bringing criminal charges against executives from the Trump Organization for involvement in the payoffs. Cohen was repaid with checks signed by Trump and his eldest son, Donald Jr.Redacted versions of the search warrant documents were made public by federal prosecutors in March this year. They showed that Mueller persuaded a judge within weeks of being made special counsel in 2017 that Cohen may have been secretly working for a foreign government. Ultimately no charges were brought on that.The Department of Justice had tried to continue redacting the names of people who were not charged, but was ordered on Wednesday to reveal the information by Pauley.“The campaign finance violations discussed in the materials are a matter of national importance,” Pauley wrote. “Now that the government’s investigation into those violations has concluded, it is time that every American has an opportunity to scrutinize the materials.”When he pleaded guilty, Cohen said he had acted “in coordination with” Trump as part of an attempt to stop allegations being aired that could damage Trump’s presidential campaign in its final weeks.In a statement on Wednesday, Cohen’s attorney Lanny Davis expressed astonishment that the case had been closed without charges against others involved, “especially since prosecutors found that virtually all of Michael’s admitted crimes were done at the direction of and for the benefit of Donald Trump.”… we have a small favour to ask.

59,Iran says it seized foreign tanker smuggling 1 million litres of oil,"Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps has seized a foreign oil tanker, claiming it was carrying one million litres of smuggled fuel, Iran's state media said. Iran had earlier provided assistance to the same tanker as had it suffered a technical glitch. Iran's move comes after one of its tankers was seized in Gibraltar for allegedly transferring oil to Syria illegally.",The Guardian,"Fears for maritime security in the strait of Hormuz, a vital route for oil shipping, have grown after Iran announced it had impounded a foreign tanker it said was smuggling fuel in the Gulf.State television quoting Iran’s Revolutionary Guards said the vessel was intercepted south of Iran’s Larak Island on Sunday after issuing a distress call.“A foreign vessel smuggling 1m litres of fuel in the Larak Island of the Persian Gulf has been seized,” the station said. “The vessel that Iran towed to its waters after receiving a distress call was later seized with the order from the court as we found out that it was smuggling fuel.”The Iranians did not initially identify the ship or its owners, but semi-official news agencies suggested the ship was the Panamanian-flagged MT Riah, a ship that went missing on 14 July and appeared to have been taken into Iranian waters in the strait of Hormuz.Nothing has been heard of the ship since it stopped transmitting its location in the early hours of Sunday. Iran did confirm on Tuesday, without naming Riah, that it had helped tow an unidentified ship in distress, but gave no further details.The Revolutionary Guards said in the latest statement that the vessel had been impounded “with an order from the court as we found out that it was smuggling fuel” to foreign ships. The ship is capable of carrying 2m litres and had 12 crew on board. It said it had not impounded any other ship.Speaking to reporters in New York, the Iranian foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, dismissed the incident as a routine marine policing matter.He said: “It’s not a tanker. It’s a small ship carrying a million litres, not a million barrels, of oil. We do it every other day. These are people who are smuggling our fuel. This is … one of the things that we do in the Persian Gulf, because of the heavy subsidies that we provide for our own fuel products.”In the current heightened tensions, western diplomats will fear the seizure of the ship is an Iranian attempt to exert diplomatic pressure.Giorgos Beleris, oil research manager for Refinitiv, said that, although Riah was small for a tanker and could dock easily, it had been recently operating at anchorages. “This could hint at something potentially shady – we can’t be certain,” he said.The UK Foreign Office said it was seeking further information on the ship and insisted that freedom of navigation was paramount.The Iranian seizure could be seen as a tit-for-tat reaction to the seizure of the Iranian-owned and Indian-crewed Grace 1 tanker a fortnight ago by Royal Marines off Gibraltar.On Thursday, the British foreign secretary, Jeremy Hunt, and Boris Johnson, the expected new prime minister, held talks with Gibraltar’s first minister, Fabian Picardo, to discuss what to do about the Grace 1.Picardo revealed he had met with Iranian officials in London to discuss how “to de-escalate all issues arising”.In telephone talks with Zarif at the weekend, Hunt offered to release the ship if there was an undertaking that the ship’s oil would not be taken to Syria, a country that is subject to EU sanctions.The Iranians have said the ship was not bound for Syria, but has refused to name its planned destination.Tensions between the US and Iran have soared, with Washington dispatching warships to the Gulf, and Tehran resuming higher uranium enrichment.The UAE says four commercial ships off its eastern coast 'were subjected to sabotage operations'.Yemen's Houthi rebels launch a drone attack on Saudi Arabia, striking a major oil pipeline and taking it out of service.Saudi Arabia blames Iran for the drone attack on its pipeline.A rocket lands near the US embassy in the Iraqi capital, Baghdad, without harming anyone. It's not clear who is behind the attack, but after the initial reports, Donald Trump tweets: 'If Iran wants to fight, that will be the official end of Iran. Never threaten the United States again!'Senior Pentagon officer Vice-admiral Michael Gilday says the US has a high degree of confidence that Iran's Revolutionary Guards were responsible for the explosions on the four tankers in the Gulf of Oman.Saudi Arabia says 26 people were wounded in an attack by Yemen's Houthi rebels on an airport in the kingdom's south-western town of Abha.Two oil tankers near the strategic strait of Hormuz were reportedly attacked in an assault that left one ablaze and adrift. 44 sailors were evacuated from both vessels and the US navy assisted.Iran’s Revolutionary Guards say they have shot down what they called a US 'spy' drone they claim was flying in in the country’s airspace. The US military confirm one of its drones has been taken down, but say it was in international airspace.  Donald Trump reportedly gives approval for the US military to launch strikes on Iran in retaliation for the loss of the drone, before pulling back at the last minute.The Iranian and US presidents trade insults, with Hassan Rouhani suggesting that Donald Trump suffered from a “mental disorder” and Trump once more threatening Iran with “obliteration”.Iran summons UK ambassador over an incident off Gibraltar as Royal Marines seize a tanker the UK suspects of carrying oil to Syria.The International Atomic Energy Agency, the body tasked with verifying Iranian compliance with the terms of the nuclear deal, verifies that Tehran has breached the agreed 3.67% limit for enriched uranium.The UK government says three Iranian boats were warned off by the frigate HMS Montrose after Iranian boats 'attempted to impede' a British oil tanker in strait of Hormuz. Tehran denies involvement.Iran says it has seized a foreign oil tanker in the Gulf. A report on state TV says the ship was smuggling oil but does not say which country crew are from.Iran denies a claim by Donald Trump that the US destroyed one of its drones in the strait of Hormuz. The US president says the USS Boxer took ‘defensive action’ against an unmanned aircraft. Tehran's deputy foreign minister, Abbas Araqchi, tweeted: “We have not lost any drone in the Strait of Hormuz nor anywhere else. I am worried that USS Boxer has shot down their own UAS [unmanned aerial system] by mistake!”The UK is deeply sceptical of the Iranian explanation and is awaiting a clear undertaking that the ship will not be sailing to Syria.Unlike the US, the UK has no general policy of trying to block Iranian oil sales, but Tehran regards the British action as part of an attempt to support the US campaign to reduce Iranian oil exports to zero.The disputes over the ships are all part of wider manoeuvring between Iran, Europe and the US over the future of the Iran nuclear deal signed in 2015 and known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPA).Donald Trump pulled the US out of the deal a year ago, saying its terms did not restrict Iran from acquiring a nuclear bomb, but the Europeans have continued to back the deal.Iran has started to lessen its commitments to JCPOA in the past month in protest at what it regards as the EU’s failure to set up an effective mechanism between Iran and Europe to maintain trade. An increase in trade with Europe was always seen by Iran as a central benefit of signing up to the restrictions imposed in the nuclear deal.The seizure of the latest ship, following a series of attacks and interruptions of shipping over the last fortnight in the Gulf, will put the issue of maritime security in the strait of Hormuz back at the heart of international discussions.In the last months there have been six unattributed attacks on Gulf shipping as well as an attempt to intercept a British ship in the Gulf a fortnight ago.The US has sent advanced fighter jets and thousands of extra troops into the Middle East, while attacks on oil tankers and the shooting down of a US military surveillance drone by Iran have added to the fears of armed conflict.The US has been pushing for an internationally coordinated maritime force to accompany cargo through the strait, and Bahrain has agreed to hold a conference to develop these plans. The Bahrain conference is not due to be held until October and as many as 60 nations are expected to attend.Referring to the US plans to install surveillance and protection for ships passing through the Gulf, Brian Hook, the US special representative on Iran, said Washington had already sent an aircraft carrier and B-52 bombers to the region, adding that “the move has disrupted and deterred much of what we feared” with Iranian plots in the area.Hook said he would meet ambassadors on Friday to promote the US plan to build a maritime coalition to deter further attacks on oil tankers in the Gulf.… we have a small favour to ask.

This is up from 297% in the same period a year earlier and makes up about 15% of all global debt. China's economic growth slowed to a 27-year-low of 6.2% in the second quarter.",Reuters,"(Reuters) - A key gauge of China’s debt has topped 300% of gross domestic product, according to the Institute of International Finance (IIF), as Beijing steps up support for the cooling economy while trying to contain financial risks. China’s total corporate, household and government debt rose to 303% of GDP in the first quarter of 2019, from 297% in the same period a year earlier, the IIF said in a report this week which highlighted rising debt levels worldwide. The IIF is a private global financial industry association, based in Washington. “While authorities’ efforts to curb shadow bank lending (particularly to smaller companies) have prompted a cutback in non-financial corporate debt, net borrowing in other sectors has brought China’s total debt to over $40 trillion - some 15% of all global debt,” the report said.  “Of note, onshore bond issuance suggests a big pickup in borrowing by local governments and banks this year.” China’s economic growth slowed to 6.2% in the second quarter, its weakest pace in at least 27 years, as demand at home and abroad faltered in the face of mounting U.S. trade pressure. To revive investment and protect jobs, Beijing has been encouraging banks to lend more, particularly to struggling smaller firms. It has also unveiled billions of dollars in tax cuts and infrastructure spending. In the first half of this year, local governments’ total net bond issuance reached 2.1765 trillion yuan ($316.5 billion), the finance ministry said on Tuesday. Chinese officials have said repeatedly said debt risks are manageable overall.

62,Author of 50-yr-old note in bottle that washed up on shore found,"The author of a 50-year-old note in a bottle that washed up on shore in Australia has been found. The note, written by Paul Gilmore when he was 13-years-old in 1969, was recently found by a father-son duo during a fishing trip on a South Australian beach. Gilmore's sister said that he's currently on a cruise in the Baltic Sea.",The Guardian,"The British author of a message in a bottle that recently washed up on the South Australian coast after more than half a century has been found – and he is currently out to sea, his sister says.South Australian man Paul Elliot and his son Jyah told ABC radio they found the bottle on the Eyre Peninsula’s west coast recently while fishing.Elliot said he was looking for the author, Paul Gilmore, who described himself in the note as a 13-year-old English boy travelling on a ship along the southern Australian coast from Fremantle to Melbourne.The note is handwritten on paper with Sitmar Line’s company name at the top and is dated 17 November 1969.In it the teenager says he is travelling on board the Fairstar, a ship that brought many British migrants to Australia during the 1960s under the assisted passage scheme.The boy urges whoever finds the note to reply to him and gives an address in Melbourne.On Thursday, the ABC reported that it had tracked down Gilmore’s sister, Annie Crossland.“It’s amazing, absolutely incredible,” she told the ABC. “He’ll be chuffed to bits.”In another twist, Crossland told the ABC from the UK that he was currently on a cruise in the Baltic Sea.“The last time he was on a ship was probably going to Australia. Cruises aren’t his thing,” she said.Crossland, who was on board, recalled seeing her brother writing letters and dropping them into bottles. He had dropped about six into the ocean, he said.The ABC said it was believed the bottle was dropped on the final leg of the journey between Fremantle and Melbourne.Shown the letter by the ABC, Paul Gilmore’s brother, David said he was amazed. “I’m looking at the message now and yeah, I can see it’s my brother’s writing — he’s obviously a bit younger then,” he said.The family lived in Australia until 1973, before returning to the UK.Oceanographer David Griffin said the bottle could not have remained afloat for 50 years off the south coast because “the ocean never stays still”.Griffin suspected that the bottle had been buried on a beach for years, then refloated by a storm.“If it had been dropped in anywhere in the ocean somewhere south of Australia, then there’s no way it’s going to stay actually at sea moving around for more than a year or two,” he told the ABC.The author gave his position as “1,000 miles east of Fremantle”.However, it is not clear whether the author actually meant 1,600 kilometres out of Fremantle, which would have included a journey south along the west coast before turning east.Last year, a West Australian woman found what is thought to be the world’s oldest message in a bottle.Tonya Illman found the 132-year-old gin bottle in the dunes near Wedge Island. Inside, she found a roll of paper printed in German and dated to 12 June 1886, which was authenticated by the Western Australian Museum.… we have a small favour to ask.

The 56-year-old Australian's tenure with England will come to an end after the Ashes. It will be Bayliss' second stint in the Indian Premier League, having already led KKR to two IPL titles during his tenure from 2012 to 2015.",CricTracker,"The Sunrisers Hyderabad (SRH) has appointed England’s World Cup-winning coach Trevor Bayliss as the head coach of the franchise. This comes as a surprising move as the team had done well under the watchful eyes of Tom Moody over the last few years. SRH won the Indian Premier League (IPL) title in 2016 and also made it to the final in 2018 under him. The franchise has now parted ways with Moody and signed Bayliss for the top job.Tom Moody was with the franchise for the last seven years and during his stint, SRH qualified for the playoffs on five occasions and won the trophy under David Warner‘s captaincy in 2016. In a press release which confirmed Trevor Bayliss’ appointment, the franchise thanked Moody for his superb work with the team and wished the former Australian cricketer for his future endeavours.Advertisement“We would like to thank Tom Moody, who has made an enormous impact with the franchise, helping us achieve 5 playoff appearances over the past 7 years including a much treasured championship in 2016. We would also like to thank him for his work ethic and leadership over our journey and wish him all the success moving forward,” the press release read.Trevor Bayliss has been at the centre stage of England’s resurgence in the limited-overs format. He, along with captain Eoin Morgan, turned the fortunes of the team and they deservedly won the World Cup only a few days ago at Lord’s. Bayliss is likely to resign from the helm post the Ashes series and the SRH has grabbed the opportunity to sign him for the upcoming season.“After very careful consideration, the SunRisers franchise has decided to take a new direction with the Head Coaching role and will be parting ways with the services of Tom Moody.

80,Bluetooth flaw exposes user locations; Android devices safe,"Boston University researchers have found a flaw in Bluetooth that could let hackers track user locations, using a third-party algorithm. The flaw was found to be present across platforms including Apple's iOS and Windows 10, with the exception of Android, researchers revealed. ""The algorithm does not require message decryption or breaking Bluetooth security in any way,"" researchers said.",Engadget,"Your Fitbit and other Bluetooth gadgets could be giving away your location data. Researchers from Boston University (BU) detected a vulnerability in several high-profile Bluetooth devices that could allow third-parties to determine your location and other sensitive information. In the wrong hands, that information could be used for stalking or abuse. That's especially concerning given that basically everyone is carrying around a Bluetooth device.The vulnerability has to do with the way Bluetooth-enabled devices pair with each other. In that relationship, one device serves as the central connection and the other plays a peripheral role. The peripheral device sends out a signal that contains a unique address -- similar to an IP address -- and data about the connection. Most devices produce a randomized address which automatically reconfigures periodically. That's meant to protect users' privacy, but the BU researchers found that, using an open-source ""sniffer"" algorithm, they could identify Bluetooth connections even when their addresses changed.While the vulnerability doesn't leak personal data, it could be used to track Bluetooth devices and their users. Android might get a pass here. The researchers say Android devices don't appear to be vulnerable, but Windows 10 and iOS devices can be tracked. Fitbit users have it the worst. According to the researchers, Fitbits don't automatically update or randomize their addresses, making them even easier to track.A Fitbit spokesperson provided the following statement to Engadget: ""As the leader in connected health and fitness category, Fitbit is committed to protecting consumer privacy and keeping data safe. The trust of our customers is paramount and we carefully design security measures for new products, continuously monitor for new threats, and rapidly respond to identified issues.""The company also said that Fitbit devices aren't able to share personally identifiable information for any users, and the company believes it would be extremely difficult to actually stalk someone using this method. ""Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) technology is widespread and allows all types of devices to connect easily without draining battery power. It's important to note that this technology can only be used to confirm that an active tracker is nearby. No personally identifiable information is shared or accessible. It's highly unlikely that someone could stumble across a particular device, know who it belongs to, and track the device's movement,"" the company's statement says. Finally, Fitbit is keeping an eye on the situation and monitoring for any security breaches: ""We are not aware of any consumer reports, inquiries or security incidents related to this issue and will continue to monitor it carefully,"" Fitbit's spokesperson said.As a silver lining, thwarting this security gap can be as simple as turning off your Bluetooth connection and then turning it on again -- at least for Windows 10 and iOS devices. And don't get ready to ditch your Bluetooth gadgets just yet. As BU researcher Johannes Becker points out, ""There are tons of ways to track people, with or without Bluetooth."" But it's important to be aware of the signals you're sending out and who might have access to your sensitive information.Update, 7/18/19, 1:45PM ET: This story has been updated with a statement from Fitbit.",https://www.engadget.com/2019/07/17/bluetooth-vulnerability-location-tracking-boston-university/?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

92,"Man says 'you die' as he sets fire to Japan animation studio, 30 dead","A man screaming ""you die"" set fire to an animation studio in Kyoto, Japan on Thursday, and at least 30 people were feared dead in the arson attack. The perpetrator had shouted as he poured what appeared to be petrol around the three-storey building, Japan's public broadcaster said. Around 70 people were in the building when the fire started.",Reuters,"TOKYO (Reuters) - A man shouted “die” as he doused an animation studio with fuel and set it ablaze in Japan on Thursday, public broadcaster NHK said, killing at least 33 people in the nation’s worst mass murder in nearly two decades. Prime Minister Shinzo Abe called the attack in the city of Kyoto - the latest grisly killing in a nation widely known for its low crime rates - “too appalling for words” and offered condolences. Police detained a 41-year-old man who shouted “die” as he poured what appeared to be petrol around the three-storey Kyoto Animation building shortly after 10 a.m. (0100 GMT), public broadcaster NHK reported. Thirty-three people were confirmed dead, an official for the Kyoto City Fire Department said.  Fire engulfed the building and white and black smoke billowed from its charred windows. It was Japan’s worst mass killing since a suspected arson attack in Tokyo in 2001. Shiro Misaki, a 47-year old owner of a neighbourhood bar  five minutes from studio, said he was driving nearby when he saw the thick smoke. “Policemen were stopping traffic and it was really hazy with smoke,” he said. “Even after I got back to my restaurant I could smell the smoke.” The prime minister said the cause was arson. “Today, many people were killed and wounded in an arson murder case in Kyoto,” Abe said in a post on Twitter. “It is too appalling for words.” The motive was not yet known. The suspected arsonist was injured and was being treated in hospital, so police could not question him, NHK said. Kyoto police declined to comment. Kyoto, some 450 kilometres (280 miles) west of Tokyo, is the ancient capital of Japan and major tourist draw for its ancient temples and cultural sites. The dead were found on all three floors of the building, including in the studio, and on a staircase leading up to the roof, the fire department said. It was not clear if the roughly 10 people found dead on the staircase had been trying to escape.  Thirty-six people had been taken to hospital by midday, the fire department said earlier, with 10 of them seriously injured. By Thursday night the fire department said it had completed its search of the building. Japanese animation, known as “anime”, includes television series and movies. A pillar of Japanese popular culture, it has become a major cultural export, winning fans around the world. Kyoto Animation produces popular series such as the “Sound! Euphonium”. Its “Free! Road to the World - The Dream” movie is due for release this month. “I am heartbroken,” Hideaki Hatta, the studio’s chief executive told reporters. “It is unbearable that the people who helped carry Japan’s animation industry were hurt and lost their lives in this way.” There was an outpouring of support for the studio on Japanese-language social media, with some users posting pictures of animation. Many posted with the hashtag “#PrayForKyoani” - using an abbreviation for Kyoto Animation. The studio has an outsized role in Japan’s animation industry that outstrips the list of works it has produced, said Tokyo-based film commentator Yuichi Maeda. “It has a huge presence in animation here. To have this many people die at once will be a huge blow to the Japanese animation industry,” he said. Violent crime is relatively rare in Japan but occasional high-profile incidents have shocked the country. Less than two months ago, a knife-wielding man slashed at a group of schoolgirls at a bus stop in Kawasaki, just south of Tokyo, killing one girl and the father of another, while injuring more than a dozen children.  In 2016, a man armed with a knife broke into a facility for the disabled in a small town near Tokyo and killed 19 patients.

Following a backlash, the airline said customers can still take photos for personal use such as selfies. The blogger said both he and his fiancée were reported to police for alleged defamation over the post.",Reuters,"JAKARTA (Reuters) - Indonesian flag carrier Garuda withdrew a proposal to stop passengers taking photos in cabins on Wednesday after being mocked over a plan that was introduced after a travel blogger posted unflattering photos on a flight. Rius Vernandes, who has more than 100,000 followers on Instagram, on Saturday posted photos and videos showing him holding a handwritten menu on note paper that he described as the business class menu on his Garuda flight from Sydney. Garuda said on Twitter the menu was not for passengers but had been meant as a notice for flight attendants. On Tuesday, a directive from the airline instructing cabin crew to stop passengers taking photos and videos mid-air was leaked on social media.  The issue has inflamed passions in a country that is one of Instagram’s biggest markets worldwide and where posting travel “selfies” is hugely popular. Garuda in a statement on Wednesday said the directive had been an internal document that had now been revised to make clear it was just appealing to passengers to respect the privacy of other passengers and flight crew on duty when taking photos. “This appeal is also based on reports, suggestions and input from customers/passengers who feel uncomfortable and disturbed by the shooting and documentation of activities without prior permission,” Garuda spokesman Ikhsan Rosan said, adding it was also intended to ensure its flights complied with rules and regulations. Rosan told Reuters that there was no link between the intended directive and the blog post by Vernandes. Vernandes did not respond to a request for comment but told his Instagram followers he had received an apology from the airline over the service on the flight. But in a later post he said both he and his fiance had been reported to police for alleged defamation over the post. The head of Garuda’s labor union, Tomy Tampatty, told Tempo news website that several airline employees had filed a police report accusing the bloggers of “causing a negative perception...towards the country’s national flag carrier”. Garuda’s Rosan said the company itself had not filed a report, only “union employees”. Jakarta’s Soekarno Hatta airport chief, Victor Togi Tambunan, said Vernandes and his fiancée had been reported to police over claims they had broken Indonesia’s broad internet defamation laws though they had not been made suspects. The policies of airlines around the world over taking photos in the cabin appear to vary depending on the carrier.  Reporting by Fanny Potkin and Agustinus Beo Da Costa.

""The F-35 cannot coexist with a Russian intelligence collection platform that will be used to learn about its advanced capabilities,"" the White House said. The US had earlier stopped training Turkish pilots on F-35 jets.",Reuters,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States said on Wednesday that it was removing Turkey from the F-35 fighter jet program, a move that had been long threatened and expected after Ankara began accepting delivery of an advanced Russian missile defense system last week. The first parts of the S-400 air defense system were flown to the Murted military air base northwest of Ankara on Friday, sealing Turkey’s deal with Russia, which Washington had struggled for months to prevent. “The U.S. and other F-35 partners are aligned in this decision to suspend Turkey from the program and initiate the process to formally remove Turkey from the program,” said Ellen Lord, the under secretary of defense for acquisition and sustainment. “The United States is spending between $500 and $600 million in non-recurring engineering in order to shift the supply chain,” she said. Used by NATO and other U.S. allies, the F-35 stealth fighter jet is the world’s most advanced jet fighter. Washington is concerned that deploying the S-400 with the F-35 would allow Russia to gain too much inside information of the stealth system. “The F-35 cannot coexist with a Russian intelligence collection platform that will be used to learn about its advanced capabilities,” the White House said in a statement earlier on Wednesday. Washington has long said the acquisition may lead to Turkey’s expulsion from the F-35 program. The Pentagon had already laid out a plan to remove Turkey from the program, including halting any new training for Turkish pilots on the advanced aircraft. “The situation with Turkey is a government-to-government matter and we’ll comply with any guidance issued by the United States Government,” said a spokesperson for Lockheed Martin Corp (LMT.N), the prime contractor on the jet.

117,Instagram to hide number of 'Likes' in 6 more countries,"Facebook-owned photo-sharing platform Instagram is expanding its test to hide the visibility of the number of 'Likes' on other users' posts to six more countries. This includes Ireland, Italy, Japan, Brazil, Australia and New Zealand. Instagram said the test is ""because [it wants] your followers to focus on the photos and videos you share, not how many likes they get.""",TechCrunch,"Would the internet be a better place if we all paid a little less attention to fake internet points? Instagram  is still trying to figure it out.Just a few months back, Instagram started testing a design tweak that would no longer show the total number of “likes” other users’ posts had received. You could still see everyone that liked your photos and videos — but anyone else’s stuff? Don’t worry about it.While the company hasn’t said much about how the tests are going so far, it seems they’re going well enough to expand them. Initially rolled out in just Canada, it’ll roll out to users in six more countries starting today:Curiously, some users in Canada (the first country where hidden likes were tested) reported yesterday that likes had returned to their feed. Instagram confirmed to us that the testing in Canada is still ongoing. Meanwhile, likes seem to be gone again in Canada as of this afternoon.We wrote about Instagram’s like-hiding experiments a few weeks prior to the public tests, after the pending rollout was discovered by reverse-engineering extraordinaire Jane Manchun Wong.So why hide likes? Instagram says it’s “because [they] want your followers to focus on the photos and videos you share, not how many likes they get.”In other words: when likes are public, people care too much about them. People view it as a metric of success — teasing those who get too few, or buying likes to try to gain admiration. If a post doesn’t get enough likes, people delete them to make it seem like all of their photos are hits. In theory, hiding likes from the feed but making them visible to the creator lets people get some sense of what’s working, without having to worry so much about whatever anyone else is taking away from the like count on any given photo.Here’s what Instagram looks like with the design tweak. Note the banner up top giving the user a heads up of the change, and that the like bar just says “Liked by username and others” instead of any specific number of users: ",https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/17/instagram-will-now-hide-likes-in-6-more-countries/?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&tpcc=ECFB2019&utm_source=inshorts

130,Prosecutors drop case accusing Spacey of sexually assaulting man,"Prosecutors on Wednesday dropped a case accusing actor Kevin Spacey of groping an 18-year-old man at a bar in 2016 after the accuser refused to testify about a missing phone, which the defence said could prove Spacey's innocence. The man's mother alleged in 2017 that Spacey got her son drunk and sexually assaulted him. Spacey has faced several other accusations.",The Guardian,"Prosecutors dropped a case on Wednesday accusing Kevin Spacey of groping a young man at a resort island bar in 2016, after the accuser refused to testify about a missing cellphone the defense says contains information supporting the actor’s claims of innocence.Spacey was charged with indecent assault and battery last year in the only criminal case that has been brought against the actor since his career collapsed amid a slew of sexual misconduct allegations. The two-time Oscar winner was among the earliest and biggest names to be ensnared in the #MeToo movement against sexual assault and harassment that swept across the entertainment and other industries.Spacey denies groping the man, whose mother first went public with the allegations in 2017. A phone message seeking comment was left with Spacey’s lawyer.The actor’s accuser was ordered to take the stand earlier this month after he said he lost the cellphone he used the night of the alleged groping. The defense said it needed the phone to recover deleted text messages it said would help Spacey’s case.The man denied deleting messages or manipulating screenshots of conversations he provided to investigators. But when he was pressed by the defense about whether he knew that altering evidence is a crime, he invoked his fifth amendment right against self-incrimination, and the judge said his testimony would be stricken from the record.The judge then questioned how prosecutors would be able to bring Spacey to trial if the accuser continued to refuse to testify, and prosecutors told the judge they needed time to decide how to proceed.On Wednesday, the Cape and Island district attorney, Michael O’Keefe, said in court documents that they were dropping the charge “due to an unavailability of the complaining witness”.Prosecutors said in an emailed statement that they met with the man and his lawyer on Sunday and told him that if he would not testify in further proceedings, they could not move forward with the case. The man “elected not to waive his right under the fifth amendment”, prosecutors said.Prosecutors said they could further pursue the case and grant the accuser immunity but then they would need more than his uncorroborated testimony.Furthermore, “a grant of immunity compromises the witness to a degree which, in a case where the credibility of the witness is paramount, makes the further prosecution untenable”, they said.Mitchell Garabedian, a lawyer for the accuser, said in email that the man and his family “have shown an enormous amount of courage under difficult circumstances”. Garabedian said he had no further comment.The hearing at which the accuser testified came days after the man abruptly dropped a lawsuit he had just recently filed against the actor that sought damages for “severe and permanent mental distress and emotional injuries”. The suit was dismissed “with prejudice”, meaning it cannot be refiled.The man did not receive a settlement to drop the civil case, his mother said. His lawyer said he dropped it because he was emotionally overwhelmed and wanted only “one rollercoaster ride at a time” and so chose to focus on the criminal case.The man’s mother, the former Boston TV anchor Heather Unruh, alleged in 2017 that Spacey got her son drunk and sexually assaulted him at the Club Car, a bar on Nantucket where the teen worked as a busboy.The man told police he went over to talk to Spacey after his shift because he wanted to get a picture with the former House of Cards star. He said Spacey bought him several drinks and tried to persuade him to come home with him before unzipping the man’s pants and groping him for about three minutes.Unruh’s son told police he tried to move Spacey’s hands, but the groping continued, and he didn’t know what to do because he didn’t want to get in trouble for drinking because he was underage. The man said he fled when Spacey went to the bathroom.Shortly after Spacey was charged, he posted a video on YouTube in the voice of his House of Cards character who was killed off after the sexual misconduct allegations emerged, saying “I’m certainly not going to pay the price for the thing I didn’t do.” Spacey has faced several other accusations.His first accuser, the actor Anthony Rapp, said Spacey climbed on top of him on a bed when Rapp was 14 and Spacey 26. Spacey said he did not remember such an encounter but apologized if the allegations were true.The Associated Press does not typically name people who say they are the victims of sexual assault unless they identify themselves publicly. Rapp has; Unruh’s son has not.… we have a small favour to ask. More people are reading and supporting The Guardian’s independent, investigative journalism than ever before.

Probably gonna walk my dog along the beach and try and put it aside. I’m sure he won’t be too angry at me,” Boult told reporters.Also Read: What should be India’s team for West Indies tour? Here’s a sneak-peek before selectors meet Friday “...it’s not gonna be something that disappears in the next couple of days. It’s probably something that’s gonna be hard to swallow for the next couple of years,” he said.    In the pulsating match on Sunday, being called the greatest World Cup final by many, the Kiwis tied the regulation 50 overs and the super over but went down on inferior boundary count. Boult said he has been struggling to forget the 49th over in which he took a catch of Ben Stokes off Jimmy Neesham but ended up stepping on the boundary to let the advantage slip. “I suppose it’s just natural to nitpick and pull apart a game like that,” he said.Also Read: Jimmy Nessham’s coach died during World Cup final Super Over “...you just wonder those little kind of things that went your way, or didn’t go your way or whatever, it could’ve been a totally different game. Yeah, of course, I’m living the last over throughout my mind a lot. “Somehow we were hit for six along the ground which has never been happened before. And then, yeah, couple of run outs, to bowl them out and to see the scores level and to lose was a pretty unique situation,” he recalled.    Does he feel cheated? The answer is a firm “no.”   Asked if he would he do anything differently, Boult said he doesn’t envision another team coming as close to winning or losing the Cup like his side did. “It was an amazing stage to be on. Obviously saw what it meant for the Englishmen to get across the line. It could have been us. Unfortunately it wasn’t. No one is probably going to get closer to winning the World Cup or losing the World Cup as us,” said the 29-year-old. Exuding humility like his captain Kane Williamson, Boult said he felt apologetic towards fans who were rooting for the quintessential “nice guys” of the game.    “You see a lot of disappointment in cricketing fans around the world, not just Kiwis but a lot of supporters that wanted us to win. It’s a shame to let everyone down really. “It’s hard to know that after playing 15 hours… A lot of Kiwis out there were saying ‘we felt for you’ kind of thing. Yeah don’t really know too much more to say really. Obviously we’re all hurting and yeah sorry for letting everyone down,” he said.    Recalling the 2015 final, in which the Black Caps were outplayed by Australia, Boult that loss hurts less compared to the heartbreak at Lord’s.",https://www.hindustantimes.com/cricket/will-take-my-dog-for-a-walk-trent-boult-on-coping-with-world-cup-heartbreak/story-LENv9x8nZPvQR9cD490aCI.html?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts
134,Neil Armstrong's Apollo 11 spacesuit goes on display after 13 yrs,"Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum in Washington has put the spacesuit worn by Neil Armstrong, the first man to step on Moon during the Apollo 11 mission, on display after 13 years. Armstrong's son Rick unveiled the display on July 16, marking the 50th anniversary of Apollo 11 mission's launch. Neil Armstrong had passed away on August 25, 2012.",Reuters,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The spacesuit astronaut Neil Armstrong wore during his mission to the moon went on public display for the first time in 13 years on Tuesday, at the Smithsonian’s Air and Space Museum exactly 50 years to the day when Apollo 11 launched into space. Armstrong’s son Rick unveiled the suit along with U.S. Vice President Mike Pence who recalled how the country was deeply divided in the late 1960s but came together in pride when Armstrong became the first man to walk on the moon. AdvertisementArmstrong died on Aug. 12, 2012 in Cincinnati, Ohio. “On top of the contributions to science and human understanding, for that brief moment, the man who wore this suit, brought together our nation and the world,” Pence said.  Advertisement“Apollo 11 is the only event of the 20th century that stands a chance of being widely remembered in the 30th century,” said Pence said. “A thousand years from now, July 20, 1969 will likely be a date that will live on in the minds and imaginations of men and women, here on Earth, across our solar system, and beyond.” Armstrong’s suit was displayed for about 30 years at the Smithsonian before it was taken down in 2006 because curators were concerned about deterioration. For the past 13 years, the suit has been subject to extensive conservation work, which included interviews with the designers and creators of the spacesuit and research into the materials and products used. “The complexity of the suit ensured it could support human life in the harshest of environments: extreme heat and cold, radiation, micrometeorites and the threat of cuts from sharp rocks all had to be taken into consideration,” Ellen Stofan, the Washington museum’s director, said at the event.  “As our curators note, these spacesuits were actually single-person spacecraft, but while they were designed to endure the punishment of a lunar walk, they weren’t designed to last half a century on display.” While the original boots worn by the Apollo 11 astronauts were left on the moon because of weight concerns, the Smithsonian does have the boots worn by astronauts on Apollo 17 which were brought back to Earth. Conservation work was funded by thousands of public donations. Additional funds have been raised to conserve the spacesuit of astronaut Michael Collins, who joined Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin on the Apollo 11 mission.

The hosts were chasing a meagre total of 242 runs set by the Kiwi team and the initial match ended up in a tie, the first for any final in tournament history and in another first in ODI history, Super Over was employed to find the champions.Henry Nicholls made a valiant fifty in the finals as England bowlers kept the pressure on the hosts, who were looking for their first-ever world title. Somehow, they posted 241/8 in 50 overs. Their bowlers reduced England to 89/4 and then in pressure, Ben Stokes and Jos Buttler added over 100 runs to bring the team back in the final. However, Kiwis pegged the batsmen back and Stokes managed to make the 15 runs required in the last over, when 16 were needed and the match was tied, with everything coming down to the super over.AdvertisementWhen the super over was employed for the very first time in the ODI cricket history, England batted first and needed to send two batsmen to take advantage of the six balls. However, the England all-rounder Ben Stokes revealed that he wasn’t ready to go out there and bat again with Jos Buttler, as he was angry at not finishing the game.“I was annoyed at myself, I was angry, I thought I’d thrown it away but when I went upstairs I had to give myself five minutes because Morgs (Morgan) wanted me to go back out and do the super over. I said that we should send Jos [Buttler] and Jason [Roy] out but Morgs said we need a left and right because it’s a small boundary. I had to go out the back into the shower room and give myself five minutes. ‘I never want to be involved in one [super over] ever again,” the 28-year-old all-rounder was quoted as saying by timesnownews.England managed 15 runs in 6 balls with Stokes hitting a six off Boult. In return, New Zealand tried their best with Neesham making 13 runs and hitting Archer for a six. However, Martin Guptill was run out coming for the second run which would have made New Zealand champions and the super over was tied. England won the contest on the basis of hitting more boundaries in the match than the Kiwis, which was seen as a controversial ruling by many. ",https://www.crictracker.com/world-cup-2019-ben-stokes-reveals-his-pick-for-batsman-in-the-super-over-in-nail-biting-finale/?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts
159,Abdul Razzaq reveals he has had 5-6 affairs after marriage,"Former Pakistan all-rounder Abdul Razzaq, during a TV programme, said that he has had ""five-six affairs that also had a validity of 1-1.5 years"". He further said that all those affairs happened after he got married. ""How do people laugh and clap at such statements? Won't be laughing when they're at [the] receiving end,"" a user tweeted reacting to it.",CricTracker,"Former Pakistan all-rounder Abdul Razzaq had said after his country’s heavy defeat to arch-rivals India in the cricket World Cup 2019 that he would like to coach Hardik Pandya to make him as one of the best all-rounders in world cricket. Razzaq had also made a controversial remark after India’s loss to England that seamer Mohammed Shami performed well in the match because he is a Muslim (Shami took 5 for 69 in that game). Razzaq’s frustration was understandable since Pakistan’s chances of making the quarter-finals had taken a huge blow after India lost the match.And now, the 39-year-old former cricketer has confessed that will certainly put the cricketing world on fire once again. Razzaq made his bold confession while speaking on a TV programme. The former batting all-rounder said he has had five-six extramarital affairs that also had a validity of 1-1.5 years. And when the astonished anchor asked him whether those had happened before marriage, Razzaq said they had happened after his conjugal life started.AdvertisementRazzaq’s confessions took all those who present on the show by surprise. The man had represented Pakistan in 46 Tests, 265 ODIs and 32 T20Is. He scored over 8,000 runs and took 389 wickets in international cricket.In a matter of coincidence, Hardik Pandya too had made a similar confession on a reality show back in January. He was accused of making sexist remarks related to women and the episode had seen him getting suspended, along with KL Rahul who was also on the programme, although temporarily.He missed the ODI series in Australia and a couple of games in New Zealand and it was a big blow for the cricketer who was just about to make a comeback after a long stint with an injury. Nevertheless, Hardik made it to the World Cup and produced a decent performance for his team, both with the bat and ball.About his coaching proposal for Hardik, Razzaq had said in his tweets: “Today I have been closely observing Pandya and I see a lot of faults in his body balance while hitting the bowl hard. I observed his footwork as well and I see that has also let him down sometimes. If I can give him coaching, for example in the UAE, I can make him one of the better all-rounders, if not the best. If the BCCI wants to make him a better all-rounder I will always be available.”",https://www.crictracker.com/former-pakistan-all-rounder-abdul-razzaq-reveals-he-had-5-6-extramarital-affairs-after-marriage/?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

The police said it has been understood that the victim had multiple arrears in his exam. In May, two students killed themselves inside the same campus.",The News Minute,"On Monday, students and faculty at the SRM Institute of Science and Technology Kattankulathur campus (Kancheepuram district) woke up to devastating news. A 21-year-old student had killed himself in the campus. This was the third such incident inside the 250-acre campus in a span of 60 days, and all three students used the same method. While police sources say that the institute should have done more to avoid the deaths, faculty and some students tell TNM that this was not a case of institutional oversight.Sree Raghav, a final year B.Tech student from Kanyakumari district, killed himself on Monday. The police are investigating the incident, but as per the first round of questioning, it has been understood that the victim had multiple arrears in his exam. In May, two students killed themselves inside the same Kattankulathur campus of the college, though different reasons were attributed to their suicides. The method that all three students used was the same, and all of them had accessed restricted areas of the campus.(NOTE: TNM will not be revealing the method of suicide as mental health experts urge that such reporting may lead to more copycat suicides.)A press statement from SRM Institute of Engineering and Technology expressed anguish over the incident and stated that as a policy, support and guidance is being offered by the college to students who are in need of counselling. However, speaking to TNM about Sree Raghav's suicide, a police officer at the Maraimalai Nagar station, in whose jurisdiction the college falls, said that the college should have been more careful in watching over its students.""There have been two other suicides very recently in the same campus. The college should have installed preventive measures, and at least cordoned off restricted areas. But when our officers went for inquiry, they found that no such precautionary measures have been taken,” he said.A professor at the college, however, told TNM that the institute had taken precautions, and the restricted area had been opened for some maintenance work only. The staff member, however, added that there is no clarity on how the students managed to access a restricted area in the previous two cases of suicides in the same campus.A student of SRM said that students also get mailers frequently, telling them about counselling options available in case they need them. They also have a counsellor on campus, he said.Psychological rehabilitation crucial“People who are mentally disturbed or are in bereavement are vulnerable to copycat suicides. When they see others killing themselves, they tend to feel that it is the way out and follow them. Copycat suicides also happen among people who try it for fun and end up losing their lives,” explained Vandhana, a Chennai-based clinical psychologist. She added that following suicide attempts, while families and friends focus on physical health of the person who has survived, they do not focus as much on emotional well being.“So what happens when the trauma is raw is that the next time they get triggered and attempt to kill themselves, it ends in death,” she said.If you’re worried about a person’s mental health, there are some behavioural changes you can look out for.Vandhana added that more suicide prevention helplines must be set up to address this issue in a holistic manner. Mass media must also do its part in preventing suicides, she added.“Movies that give warning for alcohol and drugs, do not give similar warning for suicides. These warning one-liners don’t compensate for anything. We need to create more warning signs that are visible,” she said.Making it clear that suicides do not happen in one day, Vandhana said that these build over a period of time and hence suicide prevention helplines must ideally double up and act as helplines which can aid people who need help to call and talk about their pain.Read: Some steps you can take to help a loved one struggling with mental health If you or anyone you know is feeling depressed or suicidal, consider reaching out to one of the following helplines:Tamil Nadu: State health department suicide helpline number - 104Sneha Suicide Prevention Centre - 044-24640050Telangana:  Telangana government suicide prevention toll free number - 104 Roshni- 040-66202000, 66202001SEVA- 09441778290, 040 - 27504682 (between 9 AM and 7 PM)Karnataka:Sahai : 24-hour helpline numbers: 080- 65000111, 080-65000222Kerala:Maithri helpline - 0484-2540530Chaithram helpline: 0484-2361161Both are 24-hour helpline numbers.Andhra Pradesh: Life Suicide Prevention Helpline No.78930-78930 Roshni - Helpline 1: 9166202000 Helpline 2: 9127848584",https://www.thenewsminute.com/article/copycat-suicides-srm-institute-what-colleges-families-and-friends-must-do-105615?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

""I won't look back and say I redeemed myself. I am an athlete and a cricketer and it's what we are paid to do, to win trophies,"" he added.",CricTracker,"On July 14, Sunday, the world saw probably the best ODI of all time between England and New Zealand, which was also the final of the ICC World Cup 2019. The hosts were chasing a meagre total of 242 runs set by the Kiwi team and the initial match ended up in a tie, the first for any final in tournament history and in another first in ODI history, Super Over was employed to find the champions.Henry Nicholls made a valiant fifty in the finals as England bowlers kept the pressure on the hosts, who were looking for their first-ever world title. Somehow, they posted 241/8 in 50 overs. Their bowlers reduced England to 89/4 and then in pressure, Ben Stokes and Jos Buttler added over 100 runs to bring the team back in the final. However, Kiwis pegged the batsmen back and Stokes managed to make the 15 runs required in the last over, when 16 were needed and the match was tied, with everything coming down to the super over.AdvertisementWhen the super over was employed for the very first time in the ODI cricket history, England batted first and needed to send two batsmen to take advantage of the six balls. However, the England all-rounder Ben Stokes revealed that he wasn’t ready to go out there and bat again with Jos Buttler, as he was angry at not finishing the game.“I was annoyed at myself, I was angry, I thought I’d thrown it away but when I went upstairs I had to give myself five minutes because Morgs (Morgan) wanted me to go back out and do the super over. I said that we should send Jos [Buttler] and Jason [Roy] out but Morgs said we need a left and right because it’s a small boundary. I had to go out the back into the shower room and give myself five minutes. ‘I never want to be involved in one [super over] ever again,” the 28-year-old all-rounder was quoted as saying by timesnownews.England managed 15 runs in 6 balls with Stokes hitting a six off Boult. In return, New Zealand tried their best with Neesham making 13 runs and hitting Archer for a six. However, Martin Guptill was run out coming for the second run which would have made New Zealand champions and the super over was tied. England won the contest on the basis of hitting more boundaries in the match than the Kiwis, which was seen as a controversial ruling by many. ",https://www.crictracker.com/world-cup-2019-ben-stokes-reveals-his-pick-for-batsman-in-the-super-over-in-nail-biting-finale/?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

""He has got the technique to be a number four...I am sure he will have a long career,"" he added. The 19-year-old Shubman was the player of the tournament in 2018 Under-19 World Cup.",CricTracker,"The conundrum surrounding India’s number four continues to cause problems aplenty for the Team. The problem started right after Yuvraj Singh was dropped in mid-2017. Since then, India have tried out a number of batsmen without much success. The experimentation started with KL Rahul and later the likes of Dinesh Karthik, Hardik Pandya and Suresh Raina were tested. However, those experiments did not yield the desired result.India then recalled Ambati Rayudu in 2018 and it looked like the team’s search was finally over. A good show in the Asia Cup, a fine century against West Indies and some handy knocks in Australia and New Zealand bolstered Rayudu’s reputation. However, the team surprisingly dropped him for the World Cup after his poor outing in the home series against Australia. India instead picked Vijay Shankar who looked anything but impressive in England before an injury ruled him out of the tournament.AdvertisementIndia then tried out Rishabh Pant at that crucial position. The youngster played some handy knocks but clearly lacked the temperament to excel at number four. The middle-order was one of the reasons why India bowed out of the World Cup at the semifinal stage.With India struggling to find a reliable number four, celebrated coach Dav Whatmore opines Shubman Gill can solve the problem. Whatmore rightly said that India failed to solve their middle-order woes. At the same time, he also had some words of praise for the Men in Blue’s performance in the World Cup.“The No. 4 issue kept raising its head. India should look at the future. Shubman Gill is a fantastic young batsman and he could well fill that slot. He’s got the technique,” Whatmore was quoted as saying by Sportstar.“India had a good tournament. It topped the group after nine matches, made runs, had a very good bowling attack, both pace and spin. But India ran into New Zealand in the semifinal, and the Kiwis made full use of helpful conditions. It’s just one defeat in a World Cup semifinal that can happen to any team. New Zealand did too much damage in the first 10 overs. India has got some powerful stroke makers and a potent attack.

187,"Privacy concerns raised over photo app FaceApp, company responds","The Russian company behind the viral photo-editing app 'FaceApp', that lets users virtually look older, responded to the privacy concerns over the users' photos. ""Most images are deleted from our servers within 48 hours,"" FaceApp said. ""We might store an uploaded photo in the cloud...We want to make sure users don't upload the photo repeatedly for every edit,"" it added.",TechCrunch,"FaceApp,  the AI-powered selfie-editing app that’s been having another viral moment of late, has now responded to a privacy controversy that we covered earlier here.We’ve pasted the company’s full statement at the bottom of this post.The tl;dr here is that concerns had been raised that FaceApp, a Russian startup, uploads users’ photos to the cloud — without making it clear to them that processing is not going on locally on their device.Another issue raised by FaceApp users was that the iOS app appears to be overriding settings if a user had denied access to their camera roll, after people reported they could still select and upload a photo — i.e. despite the app not having permission to access their photos.As we reported earlier, the latter is actually allowed behavior in iOS — which gives users the power to choose to block an app from full camera roll access but select individual photos to upload if they so wish.This isn’t a conspiracy, though Apple could probably come up with a better way of describing the permission, as we suggested earlier.On the wider matter of cloud processing of what is, after all, facial data, FaceApp confirms that most of the processing needed to power its app’s beautifying/gender-bending/age-accerating/-defying effects are done in the cloud.Though it claims it only uploads photos users have specifically selected for editing. Security tests have also not found evidence the app uploads a user’s entire camera roll.FaceApp goes on to specify that it “might” store the photos users have chosen to upload in the cloud for a short period, claiming this is done for “performance and traffic” — such as to make sure that a user doesn’t repeatedly upload the same photo to carry out another edit.“Most images are deleted from our servers within 48 hours from the upload date,” it adds.It also claims no user data is “transferred to Russia”, even though its R&D team is based there. So the suggestion is that storage and cloud processing are being performed using infrastructure based outside Russia. (We’ve asked it to confirm where this is done. Update: Founder Yaroslav Goncharov told us it uses AWS and Google Cloud.)“We don’t sell or share any user data with any third parties,” it adds.FaceApp also says users can request their data is deleted. Though it doesn’t yet have a very smooth way to do this — instead it asks users to send delete requests via the mobile app using “Settings->Support->Report a bug” with the word “privacy” in the subject line, adding that it’s “working on a better UI for that”.It also points out that the vast majority of FaceApp users don’t log in — making the point that it’s not able to link photos to identities in most cases.Here’s its statement in full:We are receiving a lot of inquiries regarding our privacy policy and therefore, would like to provide a few points that explain the basics:1. FaceApp performs most of the photo processing in the cloud. We only upload a photo selected by a user for editing. We never transfer any other images from the phone to the cloud.2. We might store an uploaded photo in the cloud. The main reason for that is performance and traffic: we want to make sure that the user doesn’t upload the photo repeatedly for every edit operation. Most images are deleted from our servers within 48 hours from the upload date.3. We accept requests from users for removing all their data from our servers. Our support team is currently overloaded, but these requests have our priority. For the fastest processing, we recommend sending the requests from the FaceApp mobile app using “Settings->Support->Report a bug” with the word “privacy” in the subject line.

188,Kerala IPS officer Merin Joseph brings child rape accused from Saudi,"A team led by Kollam Police Commissioner Merin Joseph arrested a man accused of raping a 13-year-old Kerala girl from Saudi Arabia and brought him to India on Tuesday. The accused, a Kollam native who works in Saudi Arabia, allegedly raped his friend's niece for three months in 2017. The child and her uncle later committed suicide.",The News Minute,"On Sunday, Kollam Police Commissioner Merin Joseph IPS and her team left to Riyadh in Saudi Arabia. Merin was unsure of the procedures that would follow once she landed in Riyadh, but one thing she was sure of, she would return to India with Sunil Kumar Bhadran (38), a man wanted in a child rape case.Sunil Kumar, a native of Kollam, was a tile worker in Saudi Arabia. In 2017, while he was holidaying in Kerala, he sexually assaulted his friend’s niece for three months. The 13-year-old girl, who belonged to a scheduled caste community, was devastated and finally revealed her ordeal to her family. By the time the police issued a lookout notice, Sunil had fled to Saudi Arabia.  The girl was later moved to Government Mahila Mandiram rescue home at Karicode in Kollam district. However, she killed herself in June 2017. Before this, the victim’s paternal uncle who had introduced Sunil Kumar to the family had also killed himself.Merin, who took charge as the Kollam Commissioner in June 2019, had reviewed pending cases, with an emphasis on cases related to women and children.“I found this case and got to know that this man was absconding for almost two years. This was a case that had impacted public conscience and people were outraged at the crime. The International Investigation Agency of the Kerala police had been following up with Saudi police, we just strengthened these efforts,” she explains.Though an Interpol notice had been issued for Sunil Kumar in 2017, the case had never progressed. Many cases don’t progress though Interpol notices are issued, as it required continuous follow-up and  co-operation from the other country involved.In 2010, then  Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and Saudi King Abdulla had signed the India- Saudi extradition treaty. Despite many Keralites who were wanted in cases in the state having fled to Saudi, no extradition has happened till now. A few days ago, the Kerala police was informed that Saudi police had Sunil in custody. Though most IPS officers would have sent junior officers to secure the man, Merin chose to go herself. “This was the first time that we would be doing such an extradition. I wanted to learn how it works so that I could, in turn, share the knowledge with my team. There was a lot of paperwork, it involved the CBI and the Interpol too. We also had to make documents to bring him back. This is why I decided to go. I am also passionate about cases involving women and children, and this was a man I believed should be brought back to face trial,"" she told TNM.Sunil Kumar Bhadran has now become the first person to be extradited for a crime committed in Kerala. And this, will perhaps pave the way for many more criminals seeking refuge in Saudi to be brought back.

195,"US' Ebix to acquire Indian travel company Yatra for ₹2,320 crore","US-based software firm Ebix has agreed to acquire Indian travel services company Yatra through a merger at an enterprise value of $337.8 million (₹2,320 crore). Yatra will become part of Ebix's travel portfolio EbixCash alongside Via and Mercury and will continue to serve customers under the Yatra brand. Ebix has invested nearly $700 million in India through EbixCash since 2017.",TechCrunch,"Atlanta-based software firm Ebix  said today it is acquiring Indian online travel booking company Yatra through a merger deal at an enterprise value of $337.8 million as it looks to strengthen its position in India’s hotel and flight ticketing market.Once the acquisition has completed, Yatra  will become part of Ebix’s EbixCash (the company’s Indian subsidiary) travel portfolio — which also includes Via and Mumbai-based Mercury — and will continue to serve customers under the Yatra brand, the two companies said. Ebix had invested north of $650 million in businesses in India, one of its key markets today, prior to the deal.Yatra, which went public in 2016 following a reverse-merger with listed company Terrapin 3 Acquisition Corporation, counts India’s Network18, Reliance Capital, Macquarie Group and Rotation Capital among its shareholders.Yatra, which posted a revenue of $31.7 million in Q4 2018, has over 800 corporate clients. The acquisition would allow it to pose a bigger challenge to MakeMyTrip, a local player that currently leads the market. It consolidated its market lead in India after buying its competitor Ibibo in 2016. In 2017, MakeMyTrip raised $330 million from Naspers and Ctrip. Thanks to a deal between the two investors earlier this year, China’s Ctrip now owns 49% of MakeMyTrip.EbixCash, which has over 9,000 employees, posted an operating income of $41.5 million in Q4 2018, with a profit of $8.5 million. Ebix develops software solutions for insurance, financial, e-commerce, e-learning, healthcare and travel industries, and has established over 110,000 distribution outlets and amassed over 8,000 corporate clients.The combined Yatra-Ebix entity will leverage Yatra’s large and loyal existing customer base, comprehensive service offering and multi-channel platform to take advantage of the dynamic and growing multibillion-dollar opportunity in India, the companies said in a joint statement. Yatra’s shares were up over 17% following today’s announcement in pre-market trading.Travel has emerged as one of the fastest growing categories in India’s internet economy. In a presentation earlier this year, Yatra said the travel segment is on track to grow to $85 billion by 2022, with online platforms accounting for 45% of all transactions.The companies said their board of directors have unanimously approved the deal and they expect to close it by the fourth quarter of this year. In a statement, they added, “Assuming a value of $4.90 per Yatra ordinary share, the transaction implies an enterprise value of $337.8 million at the Ebix collar price of $59 per share and post adjustment for indebtedness, working capital, warrants to be converted and minimum cash requirement, a net equity value of $239 million.”The announcement follows months-long negotiations between the two firms. In March, Ebix offered to buy Yatra for $336 million, adding that it might reduce its offer size if Yatra does not accept the proposal soon enough.Ebix said it is targeting an EbixCash IPO in the second quarter of next year. “The synergies and the cross-selling opportunities can create tremendous economic value for the shareholders, once the IPO is done,” the companies said.Ebix owns stake in a number of companies in India. Earlier this year, it acquired 80% controlling stake in on-demand SaaS travel firm Zillious. The U.S.-based company’s Indian subsidiary has also acquired stakes in remittance provider Weizmann, online cab hiring platform AHA Taxis, B2B marketplace Routier, travel business Centrum Direct and e-learning firm Smartclass.In 2017, Ebix acquired controlling stake in Itz Cash, a firm that offers prepaid cash cards, for over $120 million. It also owns assets in Delhi-based Pearl International Tour & Travels and Mumbai-based Lawson Travels & Tours.Additionally, Ebix has claimed that it owns about three-quarters of the market share of foreign exchange sales at 32 international airports in India.In a statement, Dhruv Shringi, co-founder and CEO of Yatra, said, “Becoming a part of Ebix’s EbixCash travel portfolio will enable us to continue on that path. As part of a larger diversified organization with the necessary scale and resources to be a leader in today’s dynamic travel marketplace, we will provide more options and an enhanced experience for our joint customers and will be an even stronger partner to the airline, hotel, car rental and other businesses we work with.”“We are confident that combining Yatra’s loyal customer base, comprehensive service offering and multi-channel platform with Ebix’s complementary Via and Mercury businesses, will create a leading online travel platform and India’s largest corporate travel platform that will capture growth opportunities and deliver enhanced value to shareholders.”",https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/17/ebix-yatra-acquisition/?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts
196,Indian drugmaker dumped key files in 200L drum in scrapyard: US,"A US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) investigator found that India's Strides Pharma Science dumped batch records for US drug products in a 200-litre drum in the scrapyard of its Puducherry plant. Strides, which sells numerous drugs in the US, was also caught attempting to shred quality-control documents. Ibuprofen is among the drugs the company makes at the Puducherry plant.",Reuters,"BENGALURU (Reuters) - A U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) investigator discovered that India’s Strides Pharma Science Ltd, which exports to the U.S. market, was shredding drug production, quality and laboratory documents and dumping others in a scrap yard. The “uncontrolled destruction” of manufacturing records and the lack of adequate documentation handling at the drugmaker’s factory at Puducherry in southern India, called into question the effectiveness of its quality unit and the integrity and accuracy of its records, the regulator said in a warning letter made public on Tuesday. The investigator observed multiple bags of manufacturing documents awaiting shredding and a blue binder including the records of batches of drugs produced for the U.S. market in a 55-gallon drum in the scrap yard, Francis Godwin, director of the FDA's Office of Manufacturing Quality, said in the letter here dated July 1.  The potential importance of individual documents wasn’t made clear by the FDA. Strides, which also has factories in Italy, Kenya and Singapore, produces drugs that treat AIDS, malaria and hepatitis. Its revenue grew 6% in the last fiscal year. In the letter to Strides, the FDA didn’t explain whether its inspectors often check scrap yards or shredding rooms for documents, or whether it was acting on some kind of tipoff to do so at the Strides plant. In its initial response to the FDA’s findings, Strides said the discarding of the binder was inadvertent. The FDA said Strides response was “inadequate” because it did not assess how poor documentation practices affected distributed drug product or how the manufacturer would strengthen its quality unit’s oversight. The agency said it found “significant violations” of current good manufacturing practice (CGMP) regulations at the facility. Shares of the Bengaluru-based company, which fell as much as 8% to a near one-year low earlier on Wednesday, pared some losses to end 3.4% lower. Last month, Aurobindo Pharma Ltd was warned here by the FDA for ignoring impurities in an active ingredient it produced. The Hyderabad-based drugmaker recalled contaminated valsartan in January and in March. “CGMP documents in the binder were dated as recently as January 21, 2019: seven days before our inspection. Your quality unit did not review or check these documents prior to disposal,” Godwin said in the letter, addressed to Strides Chief Executive Officer Arun Kumar. On July 2, Strides shares slumped after it said it received a warning letter from the U.S. FDA, it did not disclose the content of the letter at that time.  A Strides spokesman said on Wednesday the company did not have any further comment. Strides bought a unit of Vivimed Labs Ltd in January. Vivimed manufactures losartan, a drug that is part of a wider recall in the United States. The FDA’s warning letter comes months after several Indian drugmakers, including Sun Pharmaceutical Ltd and Dr.Reddy’s Laboratories Ltd, were named in a U.S. lawsuit against Israeli drugmaker Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd accusing it of conspiring to inflate drug prices and stifle competition for generic drugs.

So, whip should not be the factor,” he said.“So, the Supreme Court in a way has given protection to 15 MLAs while exercising their right. Now, in my view, disqualification (of rebel MLAs) is not possible,” Rao contended.“The way Supreme Court has given the direction, it is in a way, a guideline for the speaker for the future,” he added.Get live Stock Prices from BSE and NSE and latest NAV, portfolio of Mutual Funds, calculate your tax by Income Tax Calculator, know market’s Top Gainers, Top Losers & Best Equity Funds.

208,Who would have won WC final had both teams hit equal boundaries?,"If England and New Zealand had hit equal boundaries both in Super Over and the match in World Cup final, a count-back from Super Over's final ball would've decided the winner.

England would've won as they hit a four on the last ball, while New Zealand scored one.",CricTracker,"The 2019 World Cup final between England and New Zealand came to a rather dramatic end. The encounter at the iconic Lord’s Cricket Ground went down to the Super Over after both teams got tied on 241 runs. Even in the one-over eliminator, the Brits and the Kiwis notched 15 runs. Martin Guptill was run out in the last delivery of the over and the Three Lions won the championship.It was also England’s maiden World Cup after they qualified for the finals for the first time since 1992 when Imran Khan’s Pakistan defeated them. Eoin Morgan and Co were declared the winners since they had hit more number of boundaries (50 overs plus Super Over). The decision to hand the trophy to England at the Home of Cricket triggered a massive outrage on social media because of the ‘boundary count’.AdvertisementAfter the jaw-dropping encounter, Kane Williamson, the Black Caps’ skipper, said that his team didn’t lose the game and there was only one winner. Even as the ICC’s rules remain the same, the question is — what would have happened had the boundary count been the same for both teams?Rule Number 1: If the number of boundaries in the above case is also equal, in that scenario, boundary scored in the 50 overs played by both teams (Super Over excluded) would have been counted.Rule Number 2: In a rare scenario, even if after applying the above two scenarios, the count is still equal, in that case, a count-back would have been taken from the final balls faced by both teams in the Super Over and the side with the higher scoring delivery would have won.For example, if both teams faced six balls in the Super Over, where one side scored four runs off the final ball and the other side scored six off their final delivery, the second side would have been the winner. Whichever was the last delivery faced by two teams in the Super Over (in case if a team lost 2 wickets and had faced just 4 balls in Super Over) would have been taken into account and the team that scored more runs off its final delivery would have lifted the trophy.",https://www.crictracker.com/icc-world-cup-2019-who-wouldve-won-had-the-boundary-count-in-the-final-too-ended-in-a-tie/?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

Although the bill was passed unanimously, the Opposition raised doubts over its possible misuse. Union Home Minister Amit Shah said, ""I assure the House that the bill will not be misused...Both Houses need to prove to the world and the terrorists that we are united in this fight.""",Livemint,"NEW DELHI: In a big push for India’s national security, the Rajya Sabha on Wednesday unanimously passed the National Investigation Agency (Amendment) Bill, 2019.The bill’s uncontested passage in the Upper House marks a sharp change from the discussions in the Lok Sabha on Monday, when the government and the Opposition sparred over the validity of the proposed amendments in the bill and how far the proposed law will be able to check terrorism.Eventually, there were six voices of dissent in the Lok Sabha, and none in the Rajya Sabha.While Opposition parties raised doubts over the possible misuse of the bill, Union home minister Amit Shah told the Rajya Sabha: “I assure the House that the bill will not be misused under any circumstances. If the country does not vouch for the efficiency of the NIA, how will it hold any standing globally? Both Houses need to prove to the world and the terrorists that we are united in this fight.""Shah added that the proposed amendments would further empower the country to fight terror—as was evident in the fact that out of the 195 cases with the agency since 2014, chargesheets had been filed in 129 cases, with 41 convictions.Minister of state for home affairs G. Kishen Reddy told the House that since the inception of the NIA in 2009 to 2014, the agency had registered 80 cases, out of which judgement was passed in 38 cases, while 36 cases resulted in convictions. Reddy however, added that since Prime Minister Narendra Modi had assumed office in 2014, the agency had registered 195 cases—a huge jump from the United Progressive Alliance (UPA) government’s numbers.The Congress party, while reaffirming its stand for strengthening national security, pointed out gaps in the proposed amendments, reiterating that none of the major cases—such as the Samjhauta Express blast, Ajmer Dargah bombing, Malegaon blast and the Sohrabuddin encounter case – had reached a conclusive end.“Section 4 of the amendment adds that the agency wants to go abroad and conduct investigations as they do in India. First of all, they don’t have the treaties to catch any person abroad without going through the local police force. Have you heard of that happening in India? So, in practical effect, they will have zero power, but they will show India that they have done something great,"" said senior Congress leader and member of Parliament (MP) Abhishek Manu Singhvi.The bill now awaits President Ramnath Kovind’s nod.The NIA was set up in 2009 following the 26/11 Mumbai terror attacks by Pakistan-based Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT), which killed 166 people.On Monday, the Lok Sabha passed the bill with the Opposition red flagging concerns over the potential misuse of the proposed law against certain communities.The bill was passed with 278 members in favour of it, while six members opposed it.The bill proposes three major amendments to the NIA Bill of 2008. The first focuses on providing the NIA with more teeth to investigate cases pertaining to human trafficking, counterfeit currency, manufacture or sale of prohibited arms, cyber-terrorism, and offences under the Explosive Substances Act, 1908.The bill also seeks to expand the agency’s jurisdiction to investigate offences committed outside India, such as the Easter day bombings in Sri Lanka.Finally, it proposes to allow the central government to constitute special courts for NIA trials.As of now, the NIA is designated to probe cases of terrorism within the country. With the amendments cleared by both Houses of Parliament, the NIA will be able to probe cases of cybercrime and human trafficking as well.The amendment is significant as the agency has been closely tracking the development of Islamic State (IS) modules in the country, especially in the wake of the Easter Day bombings in Sri Lanka.",https://www.livemint.com/politics/policy/rajya-sabha-passes-controversial-nia-bill-1563366811299.html?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts
222,Mexican drug lord 'El Chapo' sentenced to life in prison in US,"Mexican drug lord Joaquín 'El Chapo' Guzmán was on Wednesday sentenced to life in prison plus 30 years, in the US. The 62-year-old was convicted in February on all 10 counts he faced, including drug trafficking, money laundering and engaging in murder conspiracies. He was earlier ordered to forfeit $12.6 billion (over ₹86,700 crore).",Reuters,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Joaquin “El Chapo” Guzman, the Mexican drug lord who twice escaped maximum-security prisons in that country, will spend the rest of his life in a U.S. penitentiary, a federal judge said on Wednesday after accusing him of “overwhelming evil.” Guzman, 62, berated the U.S. justice system, and a former associate described how he had paid a gang $1 million to try to kill her before U.S. District Judge Brian Cogan imposed the mandatory sentence of life plus 30 years.  Cogan also ordered Guzman to forfeit $12.6 billion in a hearing in federal court in Brooklyn.  The judge said that even if the law had allowed him any leeway, he would have imposed the harshest sentence available, adding that any redeeming qualities Guzman might have were erased by his “overwhelming evil” actions. A jury in February convicted Guzman of trafficking tons of cocaine, heroin and marijuana and engaging in multiple murder conspiracies as a top leader of the Sinaloa Cartel, long known as one of Mexico’s largest, most violent drug trafficking organizations. Guzman, whose nickname means “Shorty,” developed a reputation as a Robin Hood-like figure that made him a folk hero to many in his home state of Sinaloa, where he was born in a poor mountain village. He has been held in solitary confinement in the Metropolitan Correctional Center, a fortress-like jail in lower Manhattan. Cogan last month rejected Guzman’s request for more time to exercise on the jail’s roof, after prosecutors said that would risk an escape. Guzman, who recently grew a mustache, complained about the terms of his confinement before his sentence was handed down. “It has been psychological, emotional, mental torture 24 hours a day,” said Guzman. He alleged that the jurors on his case allowed media accounts of the trial to influence their thinking - an argument his lawyers have also made. “Since the government of the United States is going to send me to a prison where my name will not ever be heard again, I take advantage of this opportunity to say there was no justice here,” he told the court. Before he was finally captured in 2016, Guzman twice escaped maximum-security prisons in Mexico. He was extradited to the United States to face trial in January 2017. “Never again will Guzman pour poison over our border, making billions while innocent lives are lost to drug violence and addiction,” U.S. Attorney Richard Donoghue told a news conference outside the Brooklyn courthouse. “We can ensure that he spends every minute of every day of the rest of his life in prison.”  Guzman made a name for himself as a trafficker in the 1980s by digging tunnels under the U.S.-Mexico border that allowed him to smuggle drugs more quickly than his rivals. He amassed power during the 1990s and 2000s through often-bloody wars with rivals, eventually becoming the Sinaloa Cartel’s best-known leader. His 11-week trial, which featured testimony from more than a dozen former associates who had made deals to cooperate with prosecutors, offered an unprecedented look at the cartel’s inner workings. Andrea Velez, a former associate of Guzman, said on Wednesday that Guzman had paid the Hell’s Angels motorcycle gang $1 million to have her killed, and that she had escaped with the help of U.S. authorities. “I confess that I sinned, but I paid a high price for my faults,” Velez said of her work with the cartel. The trial witnesses, who included some of Guzman’s top lieutenants, a communications engineer and a onetime mistress, described how he built a sophisticated organization resembling a multinational corporation. He sent drugs northward with fleets of planes and boats, and had detailed accounting ledgers and an encrypted electronic communication system run through secret computer servers in Canada, witnesses said. U.S. prosecutors have claimed that Guzman sold more than $12 billion worth of drugs, and Forbes magazine once listed him as one of the world’s richest men. Guzman often lived on the run. Imprisoned in Mexico in 1993, he escaped in 2001 hidden in a laundry cart and spent the following years moving from one hideout to another in the mountains of Sinaloa, guarded by a private army. He was seized again in 2014, but pulled off his best known escape the following year when he disappeared into a ventilated, mile-long (1.6-km) tunnel dug into his cell in a maximum-security prison. He was finally recaptured in January 2016. The Mexican government says he blew his cover through a series of slip-ups, including an attempt to make a movie about his life. Guzman’s lawyers have said they intend to appeal his guilty verdict, citing a report that jurors disobeyed court rules by reading news reports about the case during the trial. Despite Guzman’s downfall, the Sinaloa Cartel had the biggest U.S. distribution presence of Mexican cartels as of last year, followed by the fast-growing Jalisco New Generation Cartel, according to the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration.

223,Lagarde resigns as International Monetary Fund chief after 8 yrs,"International Monetary Fund (IMF) chief Christine Lagarde on Tuesday announced that she would leave the global crisis lender on September 12. Lagarde has held the top role at the IMF since 2011 and is in line to succeed European Central Bank President Mario Draghi in November. A former French finance minister, Lagarde was the first woman to head the IMF.",Reuters,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - International Monetary Fund chief Christine Lagarde submitted her resignation from the global crisis lender on Tuesday, citing more clarity about her nomination to lead the European Central Bank as European legislators approved a new top bureaucrat. Lagarde said in a statement her resignation was effective Sept. 12, firing the starting gun for the IMF’s search for her successor, which is likely to be another European. “With greater clarity now on the process for my nomination as ECB President and the time it will take, I have made this decision in the best interest of the Fund,” Lagarde said in a statement. She said her resignation would expedite the selection for the next head of the IMF. IMF succession is expected to be a major topic of discussion among G7 finance ministers and central bank governors meeting on Wednesday and Thursday in Chantilly, France, near Paris amid concerns that slowing global growth and trade conflicts will pressure vulnerable economies. Lagarde’s resignation, first reported by Reuters, came two weeks after her nomination on July 2 for the ECB’s top job. She did not immediately quit the IMF because of uncertainty over whether the new European Parliament would support her and other new EU leadership positions, sources told Reuters. Her nomination was part of a package of top officials agreed by EU governments that included German Defense Minister Ursula von der Leyen as European Commission president, who drew Green party opposition. Later on Tuesday, von der Leyen was approved by the European Parliament in a 383-327 vote.   The European parliament will hold a nonbinding vote on Lagarde’s appointment, which is expected to be finalized by EU leaders at a regular summit on Oct. 17-18. Since its creation at the end of World War Two, the IMF has been led by a European, while its sister institution, the World Bank, has been led by an American. Analysts say the “duopoly” is likely to continue after U.S. President Donald Trump’s nominee, David Malpass, was approved in April to lead the World Bank with European support.  Finance leaders of Europe’s four largest economies — Germany, France, Britain and Italy — will participate in the G7 finance meeting this week in Chantilly, along with other large IMF shareholders the United States, Japan and Canada, giving weight to discussions on IMF leadership.  On the sidelines of the G7 meeting, Bank of England Governor Mark Carney, considered a leading candidate to replace Lagarde, is slated to meet with U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, who wields strong influence over the IMF’s leadership. The United States holds an effective veto over major Fund decisions, with a 16.52 percent share of its voting power. While Carney, 54, is a Canadian economist, he holds Irish and British passports and has led Britain’s central bank since 2013 and chaired the Financial Stability Board, an international body, for seven years.   Other names being floated include Bank of Finland Governor Olli Rehn, as well as ECB executive board member Benoit Coeure. Kristalina Georgieva, a Bulgarian national who is currently chief executive officer of the World Bank, has been seen as having an outside chance, according to some IMF sources. Two IMF board sources said there was concern among some IMF member countries that the Fund’s IMF leadership would be left in limbo due to the long ECB confirmation process, and it was better for her to resign to accelerate the succession process. The IMF’s acting managing director, David Lipton, said earlier on Tuesday that the fund would adapt to Lagarde’s departure as it has other developments over 75 years. A former French finance minister, Lagarde was the first woman to head the IMF and was known among policymakers as a tough negotiator. She was a tireless advocate for the benefits of trade, global growth that aids the poor and middle classes, and the empowerment of women. Her second five-year term as head of the IMF was not due to end until July 2021. Traditionally, the post has always been held by a European, while the head of the IMF’s sister organization, the World Bank, has always been an American since the institutions were created at the end of World War Two.  If approved, Lagarde would take over as ECB president from Mario Draghi on Oct. 31. While her confirmation could be lengthy, it is likely to be largely a formality as long as the euro zone’s biggest member states - Germany, France and Italy - are in unity. Her immediate challenge at the ECB would be to overcome her shortcomings in monetary policy-making, especially as it seeks to rearm for a potential new slump after years of using unconventional policy tools to stimulate inflation and growth. As head of the IMF, she has had some battle-testing, bringing stability to the euro zone debt crisis of the last decade and presiding over large bailouts for Argentina, Egypt and Ukraine. She has emphasized the need for the IMF to maintain its $1 trillion in lending firepower to deal with any future crises.

Soon after rumours were abuzz that the actor was actually suffering from cancer. In has been close to a year now and while it has been reported that the actor is now ‘cancer-free’, he is still at the same medical facility he was at, receiving post-cancer care. It was also revealed recently that Rishi Kapoor will finally be able to come back home at the end of August this year.In a recent interview with a tabloid, Rishi Kapoor poured his heart out about battling the devastating disease and the struggles he had to go through in the last one year. Incidentally, in the beginning, the veteran actor had lost 26 kg of his weight because he didn’t have an appetite and couldn’t eat anything. However, Rishi has confirmed that the phase is more or less over, emphasising that he has gained 8 kg since his recovery.“On the subject of my health, thanks to the prayers and good wishes of my family, friends and fans, I am perfect now. The cancer is in remission, but I am still under treatment. I have a crucial meeting with the doctors today at 10.45 am, there’s one treatment still left to be done. The problem is not the treatment but the reaction time. The problem is not the treatment but the reaction time. There is a six-week gap between one treatment and the next when all you can do is eat, shop, watch movies, live a normal life which I would rather do at home than here in New York. It’s been nine months and 16 days—I know since I have been counting the days—that I have been away. I really miss home,” Rishi Kapoor revealed.


 While Rishi Kapoor didn’t want to indulge in describing the disease he battled for close to a year, the veteran actor did reveal details about his post-cancer treatment. Rishi discussed the process underway and the timeline of his treatment following which he will return home at the end of next month.“I have to be here for 11 months, so I will not be back before the end of August. It’s been a difficult time, very taxing, but Neetu (wife), and my children (Ranbir and Riddhima) have been very supportive. I am grateful to everyone. I am waiting to come back and raring to get going. I will plan my return five-six weeks after my last treatment. It is called consolidation or pushback, whereby I will have to undergo chemotherapy to ensure that the ailment does not return. This is the second time I am going through the treatment. I am hoping that I can plan an end-August return but all this talk that I will be back in early September for my birthday, is again nothing but speculation.” – excerpt from the interview.

239,Magnificent desolation: 2nd man to step on Moon recalls experience,"The second man to walk on the Moon, Buzz Aldrin, talking about his experience on the 50th anniversary of Apollo 11 Moon mission's rocket launch, recalled his description of the lunar surface as ""magnificent desolation"". The now 89-year-old astronaut said it was his ""greatest good fortune"" to have joined Neil Armstrong and pilot Michael Collins on the Saturn V rocket.",Reuters,"LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Fifty years after their history-making voyage to the moon, Buzz Aldrin recalls the first moments of the Apollo 11 launch being so smooth that he and his two crewmates, Neil Armstrong and Mike Collins, were unsure precisely when they left the ground.  He remembers the white-knuckle descent to the moon’s dusty surface in the four-legged lunar module Eagle, as Armstrong took manual control of the landing craft to pilot it to a safe touchdown, just seconds from running out of fuel. And as the second human ever to step on the moon - Armstrong was first down the ladder - Aldrin recounts feeling sure-footed in the one-sixth gravity of the lunar surface while gazing at the “magnificent desolation” around him. Aldrin says he and his crewmates were so absorbed in doing their jobs that they were oddly disconnected from how momentous the occasion was as it unfolded for hundreds of millions of people on Earth, watching it all on live television. “I sometimes think the three of us missed ‘the big event’,” Aldrin said during a 50th anniversary gala at the Ronald Reagan Library outside Los Angeles. “While we were out there on the moon, the world was growing closer together, right here.” Aldrin, now 89 and one of just four living people ever to have walked on the moon, recounted highlights of his Apollo 11 experiences in an interview with an organizer of Saturday’s event, which was closed to the media. A transcript was furnished to Reuters. It was 50 years ago to the day on Tuesday that Aldrin, Armstrong and Collins were launched into space atop a Saturn 5 rocket from Florida’s Kennedy Space Center.  “We did not know the instant of leaving the ground. We only knew it from the instruments and voice communications which confirmed liftoff,” he recalled. “We sort of looked at each other and thought, ‘We must be on our way.’” After reaching lunar orbit, leaving Collins behind as pilot of the command module Columbia, Armstrong and Aldrin descended to the moon’s surface in the Eagle. Armstrong ended up piloting the craft to a safe landing after overriding a computer guidance system that was heading it to a field of boulders. During those tense moments, Aldrin’s voice was heard in the TV broadcast calling out navigation data as Eagle moved downward and forward over the surface to touchdown. “We knew we were continuing to burn fuel. We knew what we had, then we heard ‘30 seconds left.’ If we ran out of fuel, we knew it would be a hard landing. We saw the shadow cast in front of us. That was new, not something we saw in the simulator,” Aldrin recounted. “I saw dust creating a haze, not particles, but a haze that went out, dust the engine was picking up,” he said.  In the final seconds of descent, Aldrin confirmed an indicator light showing that at least one of the probes dangling from Eagle’s footpads had touched the surface - calling out “Contact light.” Seconds later came Armstrong’s famed radio announcement to mission control in Houston - “Houston, Tranquility Base here. The Eagle has landed.” The relief of the two astronauts was mutual. “Neil remembers we shook hands, and I recall putting my hand on his shoulder and we smiled,” Aldrin said.  Hours later, Armstrong’s words upon becoming the first human to set foot on the moon - “That’s one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind” - were immortalized. As Aldrin recalls, “Neil thought of that. It wasn’t on the checklist.” Aldrin’s turn came next. “I then got in position to come down ... came down the ladder, and jumped off, being careful not to lock the door behind me,” he said, recounting “it was easy to balance” as he moved about the lunar surface to set up NASA experiments. To this day, Aldrin added, he stands by his own best known, though somewhat less famous catch phrase from the moon - his impromptu description of the moonscape as a scene of “magnificent desolation.” “I guess I said that because it was magnificent,” he said. “We had gotten there, and it looked pretty desolate. But it was magnificent desolation. I think Neil remarked the beauty, too.” Writing by Steve Gorman; editing by Bill Tarrant and Sonya Hepinstall",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-space-exploration-aldrin/buzz-aldrin-second-man-on-moon-recalls-magnificent-desolation-idUSKCN1UC01P?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

258,European Commission elects its first female President,Germany's Ursula von der Leyen was elected as the first female President of the European Commission by the European Parliament on Tuesday. Von der Leyen has resigned from the post of Germany's Defence Minister to take over the new role at the European Union's executive body. She will succeed Jean-Claude Juncker who is set to step down on October 31.,The Guardian,"Ursula von der Leyen has been confirmed as the European commission’s first female president and the first German in the job for more than 50 years.In a secret ballot, MEPs voted narrowly to support the German defence minister as a replacement for Jean-Claude Juncker when he steps down on 31 October.She won the support of 383 MEPs, nine votes more than required to secure an absolute majority but below the 400 threshold that would have given her a stable majority to get her policies through parliament over the next five years.She will take over from Juncker on the day that Boris Johnson, who is likely to be the next British prime minister, has said he will take the UK out of the EU with or without a deal.Von der Leyen said she would be open to Brexit being delayed further “for a good reason” although she insisted the withdrawal agreement would not be renegotiated.After the announcement of the result, she said: “The trust you place in me is confidence you place in Europe. Confidence in a united and strong Europe, from east to west, from south to north. The confidence in a Europe that is ready to fight for the future rather than fight against each other.”Asked whether she would prefer Johnson or Jeremy Hunt to become the next British prime minister, she told reporters: “I do not know [either] of them personally and there is a golden rule which I respect that I will work in a very constructive way with every head of state and government.”The president is proposed by the European parliament and nominated by the European council of leaders of the EU member states. They lead the commission's work in implementing EU policies, chair the weekly commission meetings and set its policy agenda. They also represent the EU at European council meetings, G7 and G20 summits and at bilateral summits with third countries.The role was held by Jean-Claude Juncker from November 2014 until July 2019, when he was replaced by Ursula von der Leyen, the former German defence minister.Von der Leyen’s emergence as EU leaders’ choice for the post two weeks ago had come as an unwelcome surprise to the Socialists and Democrats group, and even to some in the centre-right European People’s party (EPP) of which she is a member.She had been nominated by the leaders after 50 hours of arduous negotiations despite not being one of the spitzenkandidats, or lead candidates, who campaigned before May’s European elections to head the EU’s executive branch.Juncker’s appointment to the job in 2014, as the first spitzenkandidat, whose position relied on a the EPP’s emergence in the elections as the biggest group, had been seen as an important transfer of power away from EU capitals to the European parliament.But opposition to Von der Leyen’s candidacy appeared to melt away after a 30-minute speech on Tuesday morning in which she made a series of left-leaning pledges to win over the socialists and stressed the importance of her being the first woman to be nominated by the heads of state and government.“Exactly 40 years ago, the first president of the European parliament, Simone Veil, was elected and presented her vision of a united Europe,” Von der Leyen said. “It is thanks to you, and to all the other European icons, that I present to you today my vision of Europe. And 40 years later, it is with great pride that it is finally a woman who is the presidential candidate of the European commission.”Veil, a survivor of the Holocaust who became only the fourth woman to be buried in the Panthéon in Paris after her death last year, was one of France’s most revered politicians, known for her battle as health minister to legalise contraception and abortion.Von der Leyen committed in her speech to ensuring full gender equality among the 28 commissioners that she would lead in Brussels.“If member states do not propose enough female commissioners, I will not hesitate to ask for new names,” she said. “Since 1958 there have been 183 commissioners. Only 35 were women. That is less than 20%.”She went on to commit to establishing a pan-EU guarantee of free healthcare and education for every child. “I know as a mother of seven that it makes a difference for their entire life if children have access to education, sports, music, healthy food and to a loving environment”, she said.In policies designed to win over the socialists, she pledged to establish an EU-wide minimum wage, a fund to prop up national welfare systems in the case of an economic crisis and to ensure flexibility in the tax and spend restraints on eurozone countries.She also committed to a far-reaching environmental programme, including a “green deal”, offering billions of euros in investment and a new EU carbon border tax, with the aim of achieving carbon neutrality on the continent by 2050.Ursula von der Leyen, born in 1958, is the daughter of Heidi and Ernst Albrecht, the latter having been a senior politician in the centre-right Christian Democratic Union who rose to be governor of the state of Lower Saxony.She spent the first 12 years of her life in Brussels, where her father was serving as a commission official. She studied economics at the universities of Göttingen and Münster before attending the London School of Economics where she used the pseudonym Rose Ladson because she was seen as a potential target for West German leftwing extremists.Von der Leyen then read for a medical degree, becoming a gynaecologist, and only entered politics at 42. A mother of seven, she has held government positions as labour and family affairs minister, driving forward key policies on gender quotas for company boards and improved maternity and paternity pay and rights – policies that initially won her considerable popularity.In 2011, Von der Leyen spoke of her desire for a “United States of Europe along the lines of federal states like Switzerland, Germany or the US”. She has since claimed that Brexit, and the loss of the “pragmatism” of the British in the EU, should propel the bloc towards further integration, and has voiced support for a European army.She is a key ally of Angela Merkel, with whom she has worked since 2005. Like Merkel, she has championed the idea of a close relationship between the EU and UK after Brexit.Von der Leyen, though, has been withering about those who campaigned for Brexit, Describing events since the referendum as a “burst bubble of hollow promises … inflated by populists”. She has cautioned that a no-deal Brexit would be the “worst possible start” to the close long-term EU-UK relationship that Berlin holds desirable.The nicknames she has acquired over the course of her 29-year career in German politics tell their own story. During her time in charge of the family ministry, she was first called Krippen-Ursel (“crèche Ursel”), a conservative closet feminist set on expanding nursery places, and then Zensursula, a control freak who wanted to shield German youth from the dark sides of the internet.When she became Germany’s first female defence minister in 2013, her (mostly male) detractors referred to her as Flinten-Uschi (“shotgun Uschi”), a caricature of the bossy career woman.As commission president, Von der Leyen will represent the EU on the world stage, and a key task will be building a working relationship with Donald Trump’s White House. She has previously criticised a lack of strategy in Trump’s approach to Vladimir Putin’s Russia and has suggested the US president’s frosty relationship with Merkel is based on his outdated view of women.Daniel Boffey in Brussels and Philip Oltermann in BerlinIn her biggest cross-party promise to MEPs, she said she would allow the parliament the right to propose legislation.“Anyone who wishes to help Europe will find in me a passionate fighter by their side,” she said. “Anyone seeking to split and destroy our values will find a fierce opponent.”Iratxe García, the Spanish leader of the Socialists and Democrats group, said: “We were very sceptical when the candidate came to our group last week, but over the past days we have to admit that she embraced our group’s core demands, with specific proposals for legislation.”The leader of the liberal Renew Europe group, Dacian Cioloș, said he expected that fewer than five of his 108 MEPs had voted against Von der Leyen, who spoke in fluent English, French and German during the debate in parliament.Cioloș said he had also received assurances that his fellow liberal Margrethe Vestager, a former Danish finance minister who is currently the commissioner for competition, would be appointed as an executive vice-president on an equal footing with the socialist group’s Frans Timmermans.Representatives from the governing parties in Hungary and Poland criticised Von der Leyen’s pledge to continue with the commission’s attempt to block or reverse judicial changes in their countries.“Lady Justice is blind – she will defend the rule of law wherever it is attacked,” Von der Leyen had told the parliament.Green MEPs were among the 327 MEPs who voted against her candidacy. Their co-chairman Ska Keller said there had not been enough “green content” to her proposed green deal.Von der Leyen, a close ally of Angela Merkel, becomes the first German commission president since Walter Hallstein served from 1958 to 1967.Martin Selmayr, the commission’s German secretary general, has said he will leave his post next week.

259,"Stokes asked umpires to not award 4 overthrows in final, they ignored","England pacer James Anderson has revealed what all-rounder Ben Stokes requested umpires after the ball deflected off his bat and England got four overthrows in World Cup final's last over. ""Stokes...said, 'Can you take that four runs off. We don't want it',"" Anderson said. The umpires ignored the request because it was a four as per rules, Anderson added.",CricTracker,"England won the World Cup for the first time on Sunday by defeating New Zealand on the basis of the boundary count. Many are criticising the ICC rules which decided the winner, the game had changed in the last over of the chase when the ball deflected off Ben Stokes’ bat to go for four overthrow runs. It led to the hosts coming back in the contest and having a realistic chance of winning the trophy. The game eventually ended in a tie and clearly, the overthrow runs helped England.However, England’s Test pacer James Anderson has now revealed that Stokes had asked the umpire overturn the overthrow decision which would’ve cost them the World Cup. If at all, the on-field had obliged to Stokes’ request, the equation would’ve come down to seven runs off the last two balls.AdvertisementThe game-changing moment is being talked all over the world and Ben Stokes apologised to New Zealand skipper Kane Williamson soon after the incident. But the all-rounder’s gesture of asking to overturn the decision should win a lot of hearts.“The etiquette in cricket is if the ball is thrown at the stumps and it hits you and goes into a gap in the field you don’t run. But if it goes to the boundary, in the rules it’s four and you can’t do anything about it. I think, talking to Michael Vaughan who saw him after the game, Ben Stokes actually went to the umpires and said, ‘Can you take that four runs off. We don’t want it’,” James Anderson said while speaking on the BBC’s Tailenders podcast.Anderson also praised Stokes for having the presence of mind to ask the umpire not to add those four runs to England’s total. “But it’s in the rules and that’s the way it is. It’s been talked about for a while among the players, potentially that being a dead ball if it does hit the batsman and veer off somewhere.“It was truly an incredible question to ask of the umpires, considering the gravity of the situation and the fact it would have left England struggling to force a tie after 50 overs of batting,” Anderson further added.",https://www.crictracker.com/ben-stokes-had-asked-the-umpires-to-overturn-four-overthrow-runs-james-anderson/

264,Musk's Neuralink unveils 'threads' that link brains to computers,"Elon Musk has unveiled his new startup Neuralink's flexible ""threads"" designed to be inserted in brains to link them directly to computers. Musk said Neuralink, in the long term, is about finding a way to ""achieve a sort of symbiosis with artificial intelligence."" ""We hope to have this in a human patient by the end of next year,"" Musk added.",TechCrunch,"Neuralink,  the Elon Musk-led startup that the multi-entrepreneur founded in 2017, is working on technology that’s based around “threads,” which it says can be implanted in human brains with much less potential impact to the surrounding brain tissue versus what’s currently used for today’s brain-computer interfaces. “Most people don’t realize, we can solve that with a chip,” Musk said to kick off Neuralink’s event, talking about some of the brain disorders and issues the company hopes to solve.Musk also said that, long-term, Neuralink really is about figuring out a way to “achieve a sort of symbiosis with artificial intelligence.” He went on to say, “This is not a mandatory thing. This is something you can choose to have if you want.”For now, however, the aim is medical, and the plan is to use a robot that Neuralink has created that operates somewhat like a “sewing machine” to implant this threads, which are incredibly thin (like, between 4 and 6 μm, which means about one-third the diameter of the thinnest human hair), deep within a person’s brain tissue, where it will be capable of performing both read and write operations at very high data volume.All of this sounds incredibly far-fetched, and to some extent it still is: Neuralink’s scientists told The New York Times in a briefing on Monday that the company has a “long way to go” before it can get anywhere near offering a commercial service. The main reason for breaking cover and talking more freely about what they’re working on, the paper reported, is that they’ll be better able to work out in the open and publish papers, which is definitely an easier mode of operation for something that requires as much connection with the academic and research community as this.Neuralink co-founder and president Max Hodak told the NYT that he’s optimistic Neuralink’s tech could theoretically see use somewhat soon in medical use, including potential applications enabling amputees to regain mobility via use of prosthetics and reversing vision, hearing or other sensory deficiencies. It’s hoping to actually begin working with human test subjects as early as next year, in fact, including via possible collaboration with neurosurgeons at Stanford and other institutions.The current incarnation of Neuralink’s tech would involve drilling actual holes into a subject’s skull in order to insert the ultra thin threads, but future iterations will shift to using lasers instead to create tiny holes that are much less invasive and essentially not felt by a patient, Hodak told the paper. Working on humans next year with something that meets this description for a relatively new company might seem improbable, but Neuralink did demonstrate its technology used on a laboratory rat this week, with performance levels that exceed today’s systems in terms of data transfer. The data from the rat was gathered via a USB-C port in its head, and it provided about 10x more than what the best current sensors can offer, according to Bloomberg.Neurlalink’s advances versus current BCI methods also include the combined thinness and flexibility of the “threads” used, but one scientist wondered about their longevity when exposed to the brain, which contains a salt mix fluid that can damage and ultimately degrade plastics over time. The plan is also that the electrodes implanted in the brain will be able to communicate wirelessly with chips outside the brain, providing real-time monitoring with unprecedented freedom of motion, without any external wires or connections.Elon Musk  is bankrolling the majority of this endeavor as well as acting as its CEO, with $100 million of the $158 million it has raised so far coming from the SpaceX and Tesla CEO. It has 90 employees, and still seems to be hiring aggressively based on its minimal website (which basically only contains job ads). Elon Musk also noted at the outset of today’s presentation that the main reason for the event was in fact to recruit new talent.",https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/16/elon-musks-neuralink-looks-to-begin-outfitting-human-brains-with-faster-input-and-output-starting-next-year/?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

Police said the cars were being offered on social media for $45,000-$60,000 (approximately ₹31 lakh-₹41 lakh). Eight partially finished vehicles were seized in the raid, and police said they are investigating how many were made.",The Guardian,"After receiving the tip-off, it did not take investigators long to find what they described as a “clandestine luxury car factory” manufacturing fake Ferraris and Lamborghinis in the south of Brazil.The workshop, Autos Fibra, advertised on Instagram and even had a YouTube channel, while disgruntled customers had posted reviews on a local consumer website.On Monday, police in Itajaí, a seaside city of 215,000 people in Santa Catarina state, raided a garage where they found eight vehicles – two “Ferraris” and six “Lamborghinis” – in various states of completion, the detective Angelo Fragelli told the Guardian. “Some were half ready, some were just being started,” he said.Photos and a video released by the police showed the vehicles, along with bonnets and seats with Ferrari and Lamborghini logos.Luxury sports cars that would cost around £320,000-£640,000 ($400,000-$800,000) if genuine were being sold for £38,000-£53,000 ($47,000-$66,000), police said. But while exteriors looked convincing – at least to an untrained eye – the motors came from other vehicles including a Mitsubishi Eclipse, an Alfa Romeo and a Chevrolet Omega. “The motors were much less powerful,” Fragelli said. “The finishing depended on what the client could pay.”No arrests were made, but police said they would charge a 53-year-old man and his son, 29, who were not arrested, for intellectual property offences.“It is a crime against intellectual property because of the use of the logos and the use of the industrial designs,” Fragelli said.The cars were documented as “prototypes”, he said. “But there are indications of fraud because you can’t register a homemade prototype car with a registered car logo.”Police had been informed of the garage by a São Paulo law firm, who had been retained by Lamborghini after alerting the car company to the replicas.Bruno Ariboni Brandi, a lawyer from Ariboni, Fabbri & Schmidt, said his firm had worked on similar cases before spotting the adverts. In February, police raided a similar workshop near São Paulo, but Brandi said the Itajaí workshop was believed to be the biggest in Brazil.“This is a company that has been investigated for some time,” he said. “We also collected information from dissatisfied customers … The cars are low-quality. Even though they use good quality material, their interior finishing is not the same as the originals.”In an email, a Lamborghini spokesman said the company did not intend to prosecute but wanted to avoid the “unlawful use of rights” and stressed “the risk for customers and the public in general” presented by replicas lacking “basic safety features”. Ferrari did not respond to questions.Autos Fibra still has a functioning Instagram account and YouTube channel. Reached by phone, one of the men facing charges declined to answer questions and referred to a video posted on YouTube on Tuesday. In it, two men attacked “sensationalist” and “rotten” media that wanted to “denigrate” their company. “We did not close. We are working normally. There are cars being made for customers there and our commitment is to finish these cars,” said the elder of the two men, explaining that the company had been in operation for 25 years.He said the company produced “artisanal cars” legally under a Brazilian regulation and that the investigation would show that the vehicles seized did not “100%” match industrial designs and therefore would be shown not to be replicas.Brandi, the lawyer, disputed this. “The law of industry property prohibits the use of industrial designs and logos,” he said.… we have a small favour to ask.

She also accused them of sending bouncers to intimidate employees protesting inside the office. However, the Sibals denied the allegations, saying the due salaries were cleared.",The Wire,"New Delhi: A day after senior journalist Barkha Dutt accused them of not paying Tiranga TV staff their salaries and asking employees to leave without paying them the promised compensation, senior advocate and channel financier Kapil Sibal and his wife, Promila, who is a director in the company, denied the allegations to The Wire.The Sibals have said that all staff members, including Dutt, have been paid salaries till the end of June and the company had adhered to the “terms of the contract” when it came to compensation.On July 15, Dutt had, through a series of tweets, accused the couple of going back on assurances made to channel employees. She said that many of them had left their jobs to join the new television channel where they were allegedly promised the minimum of a two-year tenure.Wages up to June cleared: KapilTalking to The Wire, Kapil Sibal said all commitments made by the company were honoured. “We have paid salaries to all the employees for the month of June. The employees have been offered a month’s salary as compensation apart from their remaining wages for the current month,” he said.Promila, who was looking after the administration of the channel, said that the two-year assurance was “a blatant lie”.“Everything is in writing in the contract letters of the employees. In fact, the contracts even say that probationers can be removed with just three-days’ notice but even they are being offered a month’s salary to leave,” she added.Dutt had claimed that paying six months’ wages as pay-out was the industry norm in such cases. She had written on Twitter that least three months’ salary should be paid to employees if they are being asked to leave. ‘Disciplinarian grounds’Promila said even Dutt’s own contract had it that “the length of the contract is for one year starting first October (2018).”“If the consulting editor leaves earlier then she has to serve a month’s notice. If she is removed or the channel fails to launch or folds operations midway, then the consulting editor will be compensated or remunerated for the remaining period of one year. This is because the consulting editor has already spent a year on the project and not taken salary for five months,” she said.Promila then said that Dutt’s contract was “due to expire at the end of September 2019 anyway” and that she was not entitled to any compensation beyond that.To this, Kapil further added that since Dutt’s services were terminated on July 13, the day on which she had levelled serious allegations against the Sibals, she was not entitled to any compensation beyond that day as “she had been terminated on disciplinarian [sic] grounds”.Dutt disputes this claim, and says she was sacked for speaking out in internal emails against the treatment of other staffers.On the compensation issue, Dutt told The Wire, “Sibal lies again. The contract clearly stipulates that if [the] channel shuts before the year or even [if] the contract [is] terminated, the remaining period of a [year is] to be paid.”‘Equated with Mallya for going to London for family event’Vijay Mallya. Photo: PTIIn her tweets, Dutt said that she had in her mails accused the couple of fleeing the country to London like liquor baron Vijay Mallya.Promila stated that they had “not fled due to any financial reason” but had only gone to celebrate their grandson’s academic success. “And we were there for only a short period,” she added.Foul language chargeDutt had also accused the couple of cheating employees and using foul language against women staffers by referring to them “kutiya” or “bitch” and exhorted National Commission for Women chairperson Rekha Sharma to act on the matter.Promila called the charge frivolous. “Both Kapil and I have not met her for the last three to four months and there was no mention of such an episode in her earlier mails,” she said.Kapil added that while initially Dutt had accused Promila of using such language, “later on, upon allegedly realising that a complaint against another woman could not be made out in the NCW, she wrote as an afterthought” that he too had used the foul word.Promila also took umbrage to Dutt saying that she runs a meat business. “I did indeed have a successful meat business from 1979 to 2004, but then I gave it up as Kapil Sibal became a minister and he did not want me to carry on with it. I owned the premises thereafter too but the business was being run by a well-known company, Allana Group. They too shut their operations at my plants last year,” she added.Financial trouble even before launchPromila also told The Wire that the company had been facing financial problems even before the flagship channel was launched.“In September 2018, we wanted to drop the idea of launching the channel but Dutt protested saying many journalists and other employees had left their jobs to join us. So we reluctantly decided to go ahead with it,” she said.Immediately after its launch, the company faced several problems including an issue with its first name, “Harvest TV”, said Promila. The problems kept on coming as some DTH operators allegedly refused to give the channel space saying they had no bandwidth to offer. With advertisers not coming forth for fear of being persecuted by the Narendra Modi government, she said the financial hardships only deepened.She also said that indiscretion in picking material suppliers had resulted in over-spending on equipment. Along with high offers of salaries, they had put additional burden on the company.“Despite all of this, we met the heads of departments yesterday (July 16) and urged them to accept our offer of a month’s salary as compensation. We did not want to part bitterly, but the verbal assault has really left us pained,” she said.Promila also said that the “first priority would be to reach an amicable settlement” but if that does not come through, the couple “are prepared for the legal battle ahead.”Note: The story was updated to add Barkha Dutt’s comment on the contents of her contract. ",https://thewire.in/media/tiranga-tv-kapil-sibal-promila-barkha-dutt?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts
273,Woman rescued from Mumbai building debris as rescuers spot gold ring,"A 23-year-old woman named Zinat Rehman Salmani was rescued from the debris of the 100-year-old Mumbai building that collapsed on Tuesday after the fire brigade and NDRF rescue workers spotted her gold ring. She was trapped under iron beams, a wooden door, and an LPG cylinder for over two hours. Zinat was rescued from the debris after a one-and-a-half-hour operation.",Free Press Journal,"The collapse of a residential building Tuesday in the congested Dongri area has once again put the focus on Mumbai's stressed infrastructure. Every year, the financial capital sees instances of building collapse, foot overbridge accidents and other life-threatening but preventable incidents.The four-storey residential structure in Dongri in south Mumbai caved in shortly before noon, killing at least 14 people and trapping more than 40 people under the debris. The injured were immediately taken to the Sir Jamshedji Jeejeebhoy (JJ) Hospital for the treatment. This was the latest addition in the list of such tragedies in the Mumbai metropolitan area which is replete with tales of sheer negligence and apathy by authorities tasked with overseeing development and maintenance of buildings and infrastructure assets.The building was unauthorised, officials of the Maharashtra Housing and Area Development Authority (MHADA) said, adding it was not under its supervision. It stood behind the 100-year-old Kesarbai building which is under MHADA's jurisdiction and already vacated because of its condition, the officials said. The difficult access to the site prevented ambulances and earth movers from being deployed, and rescue workers, including residents, used bare hands to remove concrete chunks, door frames and household items. Ambulances had to be parked some 50 metres away.Here are some tragic tales which emerged from debris:1. Wife and son untraceableNawab Shamani, one of the people who was injured in the Dongri building collapse, was admitted to hospital and had no idea where his wife and son were. ""My mother is seriously injured and other family members, including my wife and son, are still untraceable,"" Nawab Shamani, from his hospital bed in a voice that is a mixture of pain and anguish, told the PTI.Shamani, who works in Delhi, was visiting his extended family. While resting on a bed in state-run J J Hospital, Shamani, who is in his 30s, said he could only recall that he was sleeping in a flat in the ill-fated building and suddenly heard a loud thud.""Next thing I remember is I am lying on a hospital bed with some injuries to my head and a hand,"" he said. What worries the young man more is that even after seven hours after the mishap, his wife Sana and son Ibrahim are still untraceable. ""My mother is seriously injured but she is out of danger. I have informed authorities about my family members but have received no information from them about their whereabouts so far. They are still untraceable even around 6-7 hours after the tragedy,"" Shamani told the PTI.2. Double tragedy in the familyWhile Shamani was searching his wife and son, the Shaikh family, who resided in Kesarbai building which collapsed on Tuesday, was suffering from a double tragedy. The 25-year-old mother of two children, Sabiya Nasir Shaikh, lost her life when she went to the kitchen to make tea. Her father-in-law, Abdul Sattar Kalu Shaikh, who was one of the committee members of the local Abdul Rehman dargah, also succumbed to the head injuries he received as he was in the midst of some work near the kitchen. “He felt a tremor and shouted out but it was too late,” Shoaib Ahmed, a relative of the Shaikhs told the Free Press Journal.3. One injured while rescuing othersImran Husain Kalwaniya (30), who resides opposite Kesaribai building, heard a loud boom and saw the building crumble right before his eyes. Without any second thought, Imran ran down the stairs of his building to help those affected by the tragedy. While he was helping he suffered injuries. “I wasted no time to rush to the spot so that I could be of some help. After lifting the debris, I managed to save the life of a baby stuck under the debris. I also managed to save a man who was gasping for air as he was buried under some bricks,” Imran told the Free Press Journal.4. Deceased UP brothers had come to Mumbai to overcome mother’s lossSo far 14 people have been killed in Dongri building collapse. Out of these 14, two brothers, who had come from Uttar Pradesh after mother’s death, lost their life. According to the Hindustan Times, 20-year-old Zuber Mansoor Salmani, and his brother Muzamil (15) who lost their lives in Tuesday’s mishap were residents of Bijnor, Uttar Pradesh. The duo had lost their mother around five months ago and their father Mansoor had brought them to Mumbai to visit their aunt Firdoz Salmani, who resided in the Dongri building so that they could overcome their grief. On Tuesday, after the building collapsed, Muzamil’s body was among the third to be pulled out of the debris, while Salmani’s body was found later.5. Man hunts for missing wife and two sonsIn another tragic incident, a man named Rashid Ali, who runs a workshop of readymade garments in the locality, stood outside the casualty gate of Sir JJ Hospital, expecting to find his wife and two sons. Shabbir Ali, Rashid’s brother, told the Hindustan Times, that Rashid had left for work on Tuesday morning, leaving behind his family. But until evening, there were no traces of the trio. Rashid’s family stayed on rent on the ground floor of the four-storeyed building in Dongri which collapsed on Tuesday. While Rashid’s wife is in her 20s, his sons are aged five and seven. Rashid had brought his wife to Mumbai from Uttar Pradesh (UP) two months ago to seek medical treatment for her.Lucky escapeWoman rescued after rescuers spot golden ringThe fire brigade and NDRF rescued Zinat Rehman Salmani (23) from the debris after a one-and-a-half-hour operation. She was one of the residents trapped in the debris for more than two hours. As luck would have it, a kid was extricated from the rubble and the volunteers were about to retreat when the golden glitter drew their attention, reported the Free Press Journal. She was trapped under iron beams, wooden door, and an LPG cylinder. After cutting through the iron beams and removing the debris using hydraulic cutters, spreader and power tools, Salmani was rescued. To ensure she remained dehydrated throughout, she was given water through the debris and the NDRF and fire brigade officers spoke to her to boost her morale. According to the authorities, Rehman’s rescue was one of the most difficult operations of this mishap. Before pulling her out to safety, the authorities had pulled out a child from the debris.",https://www.freepressjournal.in/mumbai/dongri-building-collapse-members-of-family-lose-lives-kin-untraceable-tragic-tales-emerge-from-debris?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts
274,Sudan's ruling military and opposition sign power-sharing deal,"Sudan's ruling military and opposition leaders have signed a power-sharing deal. The deal establishes a new transitional ruling body which will comprise of civilians and military leaders. A general will head the body for the first 21 months, then a civilian-run administration would take over for the remaining 18 months, followed by elections, as per the agreement.",The Guardian,"Military rulers in Sudan signed an agreement with protesters on Wednesday to share power with civilian leaders.The deal comes after lengthy and difficult negotiations between generals who seized power after the fall of Omar al-Bashir in April and leaders of the pro-democracy campaign whose demonstrations led to the veteran dictator’s fall.Analysts say it offers a chance to end months of political crisis and repeated bouts of violent repression, but that much will depend on further talks on the exact details and timing of any political transition.The two sides initialled a document called the “political declaration” after intense talks through the night.The deputy chief of the ruling military council, Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo – who initialled the deal on behalf of the generals – said the agreement was a “historic moment” for Sudan.“I am pleased this morning to give this good news to the great Sudanese people … of the signing of the political agreement,” Dagalo, also known as Hemedti, said on Wednesday morning.Ibrahim al-Amin, a key protest leader, confirmed that a declaration had been agreed, and that talks on a new constitution would resume on Friday.“We want a stable homeland, because we have suffered a great deal,” he said.The outlines of the deal were agreed almost two weeks ago but the military repeatedly missed deadlines to sign.One point of contention during the negotiations was a demand from civilians that military leaders remain accountable for human rights abuses committed in recent months.In June, paramilitaries broke up a peaceful sit-in in Khartoum, the capital. More than 100 people died and many more were injured in the attack. There were also reports of scores of rapes. There have been further deaths and injuries since at the hands of security forces.The violence prompted international outrage, although Sudan’s military rulers insisted they did not order the violent dispersal of protesters.Dagalo is the leader of the Rapid Support Forces (RSF), accused of committing the worst abuses in recent months.There are reports of continuing violent repression by the RSF. The Central Committee of Sudan Doctors, an NGO, said the paramilitaries shot “at peaceful civilians in the city of Omdurman” on Tuesday, wounding three civilians.That Dagalo, officially only second in command, signed the agreement on behalf of the military rulers is being seen as a sign of his increasing power and influence.Opposition activists with knowledge of the talks told the Guardian that the signed deal includes provision for an independent and impartial investigation into the attack on the sit-in.“That was an absolute obligation for us. It is [a duty] owed to the martyrs and their families,” said one activist, who spoke on condition of anonymity.Reaction in Khartoum to news of the deal, being brokered by African Union and Ethiopian mediators, was muted on Wednesday. There have been demonstrations in recent days calling for justice for those killed during the protests.Khalda Yacoub, a 27-year-old Khartoum-based English teacher and activist, said the deal would not stop “the killing of people in this country”.“This is a political agreement, and there are divisions between the two sides. The problem is that the members of the [ruling military council] are part of the former regime and they need to change the way they deal with people,” Yacoub said.Some were optimistic, however. Mohamed Eissa, 35, an engineer who moved to Khartoum from the Darfur region, said he was “so happy”.“I think our crisis should only be solved politically,” he said. “The idea of having a radical change is impossible. This country is very fragile. I have worked in different places of Sudan and I know the amount of the weapons there are, so in our best interest is to reach to a deal.”The agreement should lead to the establishment of a new transitional civilian-military ruling body which will comprise six civilians and five military representatives.The civilians will include five from the pro-democracy coalition the Alliance for Freedom and Change.A general will head the ruling body during the first 21 months of the transition, followed by a civilian for the remaining 18 months, according to the framework agreement.That body is to oversee the formation of a transitional civilian administration that will govern for just over three years, after which elections would be held.Harriet Baldwin, UK minister for Africa, welcomed a “momentous day for Sudan”.“Today’s agreement is a step towards the change so bravely demanded by the Sudanese people. Everyone must be involved: men, women, young and old, from across Sudan,” she said in a statement.Observers say however that many of the most difficult questions are yet to be settled and a transition to full civilian government is still extremely uncertain.The crisis has exacerbated a deteriorating economic situation, a consequence of 30 years of incompetent, corrupt and repressive rule by Bashir.Mahmud Dirir, an Ethiopian mediator of the deal, said Sudan needed to overcome poverty and called for the country to be taken off a U.S. list of states that support terrorism.… we have a small favour to ask.

277,RSS economic wing says India should not issue foreign currency bonds,"RSS' economic wing Swadeshi Jagran Manch's co-convener Ashwani Mahajan has demanded that government review its plan to raise money by selling foreign currency bonds. He said the experience of countries that have taken loans from international markets to meet the budget deficit ""has been far from good"". ""We are confident that government will withdraw its decision,"" Mahajan added.",Reuters,"NEW DELHI/MUMBAI (Reuters) - An influential Hindu nationalist group close to Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s ruling party has demanded his government review its plan to raise money by selling foreign currency bonds. They say it is anti-patriotic as it could create long-term risks for the economy, potentially allowing rich foreign nations and their financial institutions to dictate the country’s policies. “We can’t allow this to happen,” declared Ashwani Mahajan, the co-convenor of Swadeshi Jagran Manch (SJM), the economic wing of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS).  The RSS was the key founder of the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party and has people it nurtured in top positions in the government, including Modi himself. Declaring that the SJM will campaign against the plan by convening meetings of influential economists, Mahajan said: “We are confident that government will withdraw its decision on these bonds.” “We must look at the experience of countries that have taken loans from international markets to meet their government deficit. The experience of these countries has been far from good,” he said, citing Argentina and Turkey as examples. Mahajan said going overseas to borrow may mean that the rupee currency depreciates at a faster rate and allows foreign governments to demand tariff reductions. A Finance Ministry spokesman declined to comment for this story. Speaking at a business summit in London, British Prime Minister Theresa May expressed hope that the Indian government would choose the British capital as the location to issue its first international sovereign bonds. New Delhi has not so far given any details about where they will be issued.  Subhash Chandra Garg, the top official at the Finance Ministry, told Indian business leaders last week that the overseas debt move was part of efforts to bring down real interest rates for Indian firms, to help the economy grow faster.  “We will have a very open attitude to welcome foreign investment and savings because that is what would be required,” he said. Garg said that the problem with relying so much on domestic debt was that the government tapped into nearly 80% of total savings in the economy, leaving little for private companies. As a result, those businesses are forced to pay up to 12-13% in interest rates on bank loans.  The government has in the past considered raising funds from overseas markets but those tasked with determining the feasibility of such a plan have ended up recommending against it.  “Most of the debt is of domestic origin, insulating the debt portfolio from currency risk,” India’s previous finance minister, Arun Jaitley, wrote in a paper on public debt in February last year.  It is not only the RSS’ economic branch that has criticised the government’s proposal. India should worry about short-term “faddish investors buying when India is hot, and dumping us when it is not”, former central bank governor Raghuram Rajan wrote in an article for the Times of India newspaper last Saturday. The SJM has shown it can mobilise opinion to change government policy on several occasions in the past few years, including pushing it to take a harder line against genetically modified crops and a more protectionist stance on trade issues.  It helped to pressure the government into introducing new e-commerce regulations in February that upset two American behemoths, Amazon.com Inc and Walmart. The U.S. companies said the move discriminated against them and favoured domestic retailers. But the BJP may not bend on this occasion. Gopal Krishna Agarwal, the BJP’s national spokesman on economic affairs, said that despite some risks highlighted by the critics, the sovereign bonds were the “best alternative” at this point, considering the government’s massive investment plans.  The government’s goal of keeping real interest rates low makes it difficult to raise funds in the domestic market at reasonable rates, he added. Agarwal cautioned, however, that the government has to stick to its fiscal deficit target of 3.3% of GDP for the current year ending next March and ensure that overseas borrowing does not lead to a higher deficit. Based on its sovereign credit rating, which stands at ‘BBB-‘, analysts suggest India would be able to raise U.S. dollar funds overseas at about 3.2% at current market rates, though that figure would rise once hedging costs are taken into account. The 10-year government bond, the most liquid paper in the domestic debt market, closed at 6.33% on Tuesday. Overseas borrowing exposes the government’s liabilities to currency fluctuations and can therefore impact domestic interest rates. “India’s vulnerability to external events is very high given its disproportionately high dependence on imported oil,” said Rupa Rege Nitsure, chief economist at L&T Financial Holdings.

320,Breathtaking: Biologist on finding rare human-sized jellyfish,"Wildlife host and biologist Lizzie Daly, sharing her encounter with a rare human-sized barrel jellyfish, described it as a ""breathtaking"" and ""serene, grounding experience"". ""I know barrel jellyfish get really big in size but I have never seen anything like it before,"" Daly said. The giant 1.5-metre-long barrel jellyfish was spotted off the south-western coast of England last week.",The Guardian,"A giant barrel jellyfish has been spotted off the coast of Cornwall by divers.“I’ve never seen one that big,” said Lizzie Daly, a biologist who saw the creature near Falmouth. “We had seen a few smaller jellyfish at a beautiful reef nearby, and then out of the murk came this huge, beautiful jelly fish. You just take a double look and ask yourself if it’s actually a metre and a half long.”She said swimming alongside the “gentle giant” was “such a serene, grounding experience”.Thousands of the creatures, the largest jellyfish found in British coastal waters, flock through the Atlantic Ocean towards warm coastal waters in the west of the UK each year and are often found washed up on beaches across May and June.Owing to the late summer, the animals, which normally measure up to about a metre with their tentacles, were still being spotted in south-west England, south Wales and elsewhere. This was not unusual, Daly said, and the sightings were not part of a “freak jellyfish wash-up”.Daly and an underwater camera operator, Dan Abbott, were diving in Falmouth as part of the online series Wild Ocean Week and stayed with the abnormally large, translucent bell-mushroom-shaped animal for about an hour before it swam away.The pair said they were not surprised by the animal’s behaviour. “It has got a very mild sting and poses no threat to humans – some people don’t even feel it,” Daly said. “Many people would be immediately worried, but it is not dangerous. Its a majestic creature.”However, she said her response may have differed if it was a Portuguese man o’ war, which carries a potentially deadly sting.Dr Michele Kiernan from the Marine Biological Association in Plymouth said little was known about the lifestyles of barrel jellyfish, including where their young live, and that their movements were at the mercy of winds and currents.“As we’ve had a long spell of no rain in the south-west, people can see them more easily because of the clarity in the water,” she said.Their predators could also be reducing in number, she continued. Barrel jellyfish are the favourite prey of leatherback turtles, while they are also eaten by other animals which are increasingly “getting caught in entanglements and waste in the water.”In 2015, flocks of barrel jellyfish, which each have eight frilly tentacles, were seen gliding through the sea off the Cornwall coast.

SpiceJet pilots were suspended for damaging runway lights during landing. Air India pilot and cabin crew member were suspended for fighting after the pilot asked the crew member to wash his tiffin.",Times Now,"New Delhi: Aviation regulator Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) on Tuesday suspended three pilots - one from national carrier Air India and two from private airline SpiceJet - for violation of safety norms and grounded one Vistara pilot for diversion of his flight. One cabin crew of Air India has also been suspended. The aviation watchdog has suspended flying licences of three pilots for six months. According to a news agency, the Spicejet pilots have been suspended in connection with an incident on June 2 when an aircraft they were operating damaged runway edge lights during landing. The two SpiceJet pilots have been identified as Aarati Gunasekaran and Saurabh Gulia. The watchdog's decision has come after the replies provided by them to the show cause notice were not satisfactory, reported PTI. The Air India pilot and the cabin crew member have been suspended in relation to a physical altercation between the two inside the aircraft on June 17. According to reports, cabin crew member Rajat Verman was involved in a heated argument and physical altercation with pilot Milind when the plane was to depart from Bengaluru to Kolkata.The two had an argument after the pilot reportedly asked the cabin crew member to wash his tiffin. The flight delayed by nearly two hours and could only take off after the crew and captain was replaced. ""I have been told that the captain wanted the cabin crew member to clean the tiffin after he finished his meal. Probably, this is what led to a fight between them. An investigation has been started. Strict action will be taken,"" an Air India official had said. The Vistara pilot has been grounded in an incident of flight diversion on June 15. According to reports, the pilot had diverted the flight from Mumbai to Delhi to Lucknow due to bad weather, however, it was later revealed that the aircraft had less fuel. Yesterday, DGCA also asked Air India take 'strict' action against an airline pilot who reportedly failed the alcohol test twice. Reports suggest that the pilot had first failed the alcohol test on October 21, 2015, when he was scheduled to fly an aircraft from Goa and then recently on July 13 when he was off duty but was scheduled to travel as an Additional Crew Member (ACM) in the cockpit.

Another faculty Samuel Tennyson was accused of abetting Raveen's behaviour.",The News Minute,"The Madras Christian College in Chennai has sacked a professor from the department of Zoology after he was found guilty of sexually harassing the female students of the department during a college tour. R Raveen, who was an assistant professor in the Zoology department was dismissed after a detailed inquiry by the college Internal Complaints Committee into the incident. His colleague Samuel Tennyson, another faculty from the department, too had been accused of abetting Raveen's behaviour. However, the college is yet to dismiss Samuel due to a case filed by him on the issue in the Madras High Court. MCC's principal Alexander Jesudasan confirmed the dismissal. ""We have dismissed the professor after the ICC found him guilty of multiple cases of sexual harassment against students of the department. As for Samuel, the college cannot issue a dismissal order as there is a court case pending on the issue. However, the court has directed Samuel not to enter the campus premises,"" the principal said. A student from the Zoology department also added that the dismissed professor had not visited the college for over three weeks. ""Ever since college re-opened in June, he has not been coming to college. I had enquired with the other staff of the department and they also said that his attendance book showed that he was 'officially dismissed as per government norms',” the student added. In February this year, the dismissed professor along with Samuel Tennyson had taken a group of 50 students to Karnataka as part of a college excursion. During the trip, several girl students complained that the professor in question made lewd remarks about their clothes, harassed them and behaved inappropriately. They also alleged that throughout the trip, Tennyson had abetted Raveen’s behaviour by encouraging him. On returning to Chennai, the students complained to the Head of the Department who dismissed their complaints, calling it a 'first time offence' by the said teacher. Later, a petition signed by 30 odd students of the department protesting the college's lack of initiative in addressing the issue caught the attention of the authorities. An ICC inquiry was held on the issue, and statements of the students who were subjected to harassment and the accused professors were recorded. On May 24, the ICC released the results of the inquiry which found both the professors guilty. ""We have not not received any official intimation by the college authorities regarding the professor's dismissal.

330,Fabian Delph joins Everton from Manchester City for ₹72 crore,Premier League club Everton on Monday signed midfielder Fabian Delph from Manchester City for over ₹72 crore (£8.5 mn) on a three-year deal. The 29-year-old England international who joined Manchester City in 2015 scored 5 goals from 89 matches for the club. Delph has played 20 international matches and was also part of team's 2018 World Cup squad.,The Guardian,"Everton have completed the signing of Fabian Delph from Manchester City with Marco Silva convinced the 29-year-old can play an influential role on and off the pitch at Goodison Park.The England international had one year remaining on his City contract but wanted more regular first-team football having made 20 appearances in their treble-winning season. Everton will pay an initial £8.5m for the midfielder, rising to £10m with add-ons. The former Leeds and Aston Villa player has signed a three-year deal at Goodison.Delph joined his new teammates at their pre-season training camp in Verbier, Switzerland, on Monday and insists he retains an appetite for silverware despite leaving the Etihad Stadium.He said: “The club that I’ve been at has had success, especially in the last two seasons, but over the last four years we managed to win trophies. I wanted to be playing more regularly and the opportunity to come and play for Everton Football Club was too good of an opportunity to turn down.“I’m hungry. I don’t like losing. I see myself as a winner. I’m at an age now where I am probably one of the most experienced players, so hopefully I can bring that and try to help my teammates here to do better. Ultimately, the goal is to win something. I’ve not come here just to be here – I’ve come here with ambitions to win things.”At 29, Delph does not fit the profile of Everton signings outlined by their director of football, Marcel Brands, although he has stated that allowances will be made for older, good value targets. Silva, however, is keen to add more dominant personalities into the dressing room and believes an England international with title-winning experience can be an important addition.The Everton manager said: “When I look to bring a new player into our squad, the first thing I look for above all the other things is quality and Fabian is a player with high-quality. But what they can bring to our dressing room is also important and if you can put those two things together then that can only be good for the club. Fabian is a player that can give us different solutions in our midfield because he can play in more than one position and that is important for us.”Delph is Everton’s third signing of the summer following fellow midfielder Andre Gomes and former Huddersfield goalkeeper Jonas Lossl.",https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jul/15/fabian-delph-everton-manchester-city-transfer?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

It added it plans to have 50 OYO Workspaces centres by end of 2019.",TechCrunch,"India’s Oyo has expanded its hotel chain business to more than 80 countries and entered the co-living spaces segment in recent years. The firm, which has raised about $1 billion since last September from several big names, including Airbnb, has now identified a new business to target: co-working spaces.The Gurgaon-headquartered firm on Tuesday announced Oyo Workspaces, which is already operational across 10 cities in India with more than 20 centres. It currently has the capacity to serve more than 15,000 people. More than 6,000 employees from firms such as Swiggy, Paytm, Pepsi, Nykaa, OLX and Lenskart have already signed up for the service.At a press conference in New Delhi, Rohit Kapoor, CEO of New Real Estate Businesses, said Oyo plans to have 50 Oyo Workspaces centres by the end of the year and aims to make it the largest co-working business in Asia by the end of next year.As part of the announcement, Oyo confirmed that it has acquired Innov8,  a co-working startup with more than 200 employees and 16 operational centres. The four-year-old startup was acquired for about $30 million, two sources familiar with the matter told TechCrunch.Innov8 is one of the three in-house brands that is part of Oyo Workspaces. The other two brands — Workflo and Powerstation — are aimed at people who are looking for economical offering. A user could access one of these co-working spaces for as low as Rs 6,999 ($102) a month. Innov8 has been positioned as a premium option.India’s co-working space, still a relatively new business category locally, is worth $390 million — a fraction of the $30 billion office and commercial real estate business. Kapoor said Oyo believes it can not only become a market leader in the nation but also expand the size of the market itself. Oyo Workspaces will compete with a range of companies, including 91Springboard, GoHive, Awfis, GoWork and the global giant WeWork.Oyo Workspaces will offer a range of services across all of its centres, such as a Wi-Fi connection, in-house kitchen, housekeeping, storage and parking spaces. It is also offering users monthly and quarterly passes — currently being offered at heavily discounted rates — to further lower the price points of its co-working spaces.Oyo, which serves more than half a million users each day across more than 850,000 rooms it operates, is aggressively expanding its business through partnerships with local players as it emerges as the third-largest hotel chain in the world. The six-year-old startup was valued at more than $5 billion at its last funding round, TechCrunch reported earlier.Oyo, which serves as both listings and reservations platforms, makes most of its money from fee-paying franchises and bookings. Kapoor said the company will use part of the $200 million Oyo has committed to invest in its India and Southeast Asia businesses this year.",https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/16/oyo-workspaces-innov8/?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

Prime Minister Theresa May made the announcement after a round-table meeting with auto-industry representatives. Earlier this month, the Tata Motors subsidiary announced a new range of electrified cars to be made at a plant in central England.",The Guardian,"The government has handed Jaguar Land Rover a £500m loan guarantee to help accelerate its progress in the global electric vehicle race.Theresa May said the loan guarantee would help Britain’s biggest carmaker sell the next generation of electric cars around the world. She told a meeting of industry leaders at Downing Street on Monday that the funding pot would include £500m from UK Export Finance alongside another £125m from commercial lenders.The roundtable talks included executives from Aston Martin, BMW, Nissan and Vauxhall as well as energy groups BP, Shell and National Grid.The companies have agreed to set up a green mobility transition board that will formally bring together government, industry and environmental groups to coordinate plans for a switch from traditional to electric vehicles.May told the gathering that the government was committed to supporting the UK’s automotive sector and expected it to remain at the forefront of the design and manufacturing of electric vehicles.She set out a number of commitments to increase electric vehicle use, including plans for England to become the first country to introduce mandatory electric car charging points in new homes. There are fewer than 200,000 all electric vehicles on UK roads.Under the government’s plans, outlined by the Department for Transport, all new-build homes should be fitted with an electric car charge point to prepare for growing numbers of ultra-low-emission vehicles on UK roads.The government is also seeking views on how to use “smart” charging technology, which uses algorithms to automatically charge parked cars when electricity prices are at their lowest.Chris Grayling, the transport secretary, said: “[It is] clear there is an appetite for cleaner, greener transport. Home charging provides the most convenient and low-cost option for consumers – you can simply plug your car in to charge overnight as you would a mobile phone.”The government said it wanted to end the sale of traditional combustion engine vehicles from 2040 but many – including the Committee on Climate Change – have warned the ban should come into force a decade sooner.This month Jaguar revealed plans to invest billions of pounds in building an electric version of the Jaguar XJ saloon at its Castle Bromwich factory. The proposals include a major upgrade of the plant, based in the outskirts of Birmingham, safeguarding the jobs of 2,500 people in what is a troubled time for the industry. The carmaker has promised that from next year it will offer customers an electric version of all its models.•The headline and second paragraph of this article were amended on 16 July 2019 to clarify that JLR is receiving a loan guarantee rather than a loan from the government… in our natural world, we refuse to turn away from the climate catastrophe and species extinction.

346,Democracy restored in Thailand as PM declares end of military rule,Thai Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o-cha has declared the end of military rule in the country after he resigned as the head of the military junta. Prayut had led the coup in 2014 and served as junta leader and Prime Minister. He will continue to serve as the Prime Minister with the support of the Parliament.,Reuters,"BANGKOK (Reuters) - Thai Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha formally resigned as the head of the military government on Monday, saying the country would function as a normal democracy after five years of military rule. Prayuth stays on as prime minister with the backing of pro-military parties in parliament and a military-appointed upper house under a constitution that critics say stifles democracy and enshrines a political role for the military. Prayuth, in a televised address to the nation, said military rule had brought success in many areas, from fixing the problem of illegal fishing and human trafficking, to the rescue of 12 boys and their soccer coach trapped in a flooded cave last year. The former army chief who seized power in a 2014 coup, said the intervention then had been necessary to restore order after six months of street protests and violent clashes, but things were getting back to normal after a March 24 election. “Thailand is now fully a democratic country with a constitutional monarchy, with a parliament whose members are elected,” Prayuth said. “All problems will be addressed normally based on a democratic system with no use of special powers,” he said, referring to sweeping powers the military government wielded. Last week, Prayuth used those powers for one last time to end various restrictions on media. He also transferred civilian legal cases from military to civilian court though he retained the power to let security forces carry out searches and make arrests unchallenged. King Maha Vajiralongkorn last week endorsed Prayuth’s new civilian cabinet, drawn from a 19-party coalition government that holds a slim majority in parliament. Thailand has seen intermittent bouts of political turmoil and violence - as well as two military coups - over the past 15 years as new political forces drawing support from the countryside have challenged the Bangkok-based military-royalist establishment. People are generally cautious about what the new set-up might bring. “We have to see their work first,” Noppawan Hiranpruk, 47, a market vendor told Reuters.  “It’s OK to have old faces provided they have new ideas to make new things happen,” she said. The new government will officially take power after a swearing in ceremony on Tuesday.  It is due to present its policies to parliament next week.

The deceased have been identified as the temple caretaker, his sister and a woman from the village.",The News Minute,"In an incident of suspected human sacrifice and black magic, three people were found dead in the premises of a temple in Korthikota of Tanakal in Anantapur district of Andhra Pradesh. The three people – Shivarami Reddy who was looking after the temple, his sister Kamalamma, and another woman from the same village, Sathyalakshmi – were found with their throats slit in the under construction temple. On Monday morning, the local police found three dead bodies in the Shivalayam which is under construction, as the old temple in the village was demolished sometime back. Of the three victims, two were found lying on a cot, and on the ground, in a pool of blood. A  devotee who came to the temple in the morning found the dead bodies and informed the police. While the dead bodies were found right outside the temple, their blood was splattered over the Shivalingam inside the temple. Speaking to TNM, Kadiri Rural Circle Inspector Madhu said they’re also investigating whether the crime scene was arranged in such a way to throw off the probe. “We suspect that someone deliberately tried to influence the investigation by doing some suspicious things after the murders,” he said. Police suspect the three people were killed with sharp objects. A murder case has been registered and investigation is underway.Kadiri DySP Srinivasulu said, “Unidentified persons have killed Shivarami Reddy by causing heavy injuries on his head, as per preliminary investigation. We have roped in the dog squad and clues teams, we will use all the clues to investigate the case from all possible angles.""An investigating officer also told TNM that they're looking into a “treasure hunt” angle given the abnormality of the crime scene.In a similar case, a headless body was found in Nallamala forests of Kurnool district earlier this week raising suspicions about human sacrifice.",https://www.thenewsminute.com/article/3-found-dead-temple-premises-anantapur-human-sacrifice-suspected-105481?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

In the fourth round in the first week of July, it raised $86 million ( ₹589 crore) at a valuation of $5.5 billion.Such valuation differences within a round are uncommon. Experts said the valuation jumps are a function of Byju’s rapid growth. Bengaluru-based Think and Learn Pvt. Ltd, which runs Byju’s, grew its revenue threefold in the year ended 31 March to  ₹1,430 crore and turned profitable on a full-year basis.“It is likely that it is commanding steep increases in valuation on a month-on-month basis, not year-on-year, as other startups might,"" said Vivek Durai, founder of Paper.vc. “Among India’s unicorns, Byju’s has the highest leverage today vis-a-vis prospective investors.""Its expansion into grades I-III and entry into the US market have contributed to the valuation jump, investors said.Byju’s is benefiting from Indian parents’ willingness to spend on education to give their children an edge. It has already attracted more than 35 million students, assisting them to understand concepts in maths, science and English.Byju’s growth is expected to continue as it expands its learning programmes for K-12 students and ventures into new markets.“Given that in ed-tech there are not too many other large companies available to invest, Byju’s will attract a premium. There are other parameters such as customer acquisition costs, life-time value of users, which is also much higher for Byju’s than other competitors,"" said an investment banker on condition of anonymity.There could still be more valuation jumps.

370,Conjoined twin girls separated after 55 hours of operations,"Two-year-old sisters Safa and Marwa Ullah, from Charsadda in Pakistan, have been separated at the Great Ormond Street Hospital in London after 55 hours of operations. The rare conjoined twins underwent four operations. ""Safa and Marwa have a long road ahead - but we are hopeful they will be able to live active, happy lives!"" the hospital tweeted.",The Guardian,"Rare conjoined twins have been separated at a world-leading children’s hospital in London, surgeons have announced.Two-year-old sisters Safa and Marwa Ullah, from Charsadda in Pakistan, underwent three major operations to separate their heads at Great Ormond Street hospital (GOSH).The first operation took place in October 2018, when the girls were 19 months old. The last operation, during which they were finally separated, was carried out on 11 February.The girls, who were born by caesarean section, were craniopagus twins, with their skulls and blood vessels fused together. GOSH has previously successfully separated craniopagus twins in 2006 and 2011.In order to ensure the operations went smoothly, experts used virtual reality to create an exact replica of the girls’ anatomies. This enabled surgeons to visualise the complex structure of their skulls as well as the positioning of their brains and blood vessels.A team also used 3D printing to create plastic models of the structures that could be used for practice. Cutting guides were created so that surgeons could work more precisely.During the surgery, doctors first worked to separate the girls’ blood vessels and then inserted a piece of plastic into their heads to keep the brains and blood vessels apart. Scans had shown that the girls have two distinct brains but these are misshapen, which the plastic and an accompanying pulley system helped to correct.During further surgery, the girls started to bleed after clots formed in Safa’s neck veins and she began to shunt blood to her twin. Doctors were concerned they might lose Marwa during the operation after her heart rate fell. As a result of her complications, they gave her a key vein that the twins shared. But this had an impact on Safa, who had a stroke less than 12 hours later due to the loss of the vein.The final major operation involved medics building new skulls using the girls’ own bone. They also used tissue expanders to ensure each girl’s skin would stretch over the top of her head.The surgery, which was paid for by a private donor, has been followed by several smaller procedures to enable the girls to live independent lives. The operations added up to more than 50 hours of surgery time and involved 100 members of GOSH staff.The girls’ mother, Zainab Bibi, 34, said: “We are indebted to the hospital and to the staff and we would like to thank them for everything they have done. We are extremely excited about the future.”The girls, whose father died of a heart attack while their mother was pregnant with them, were discharged from GOSH on 1 July and moved to a London address with their mother, their grandfather Mohammad Sadat and an uncle, Mohammad Idrees. They are undergoing daily physiotherapy as part of their rehabilitation.Neurosurgeon Noor Ul Owase Jeelani and craniofacial surgeon Prof David Dunaway led the team that operated on the girls. They said in a statement: “We are delighted we have been able to help Safa and Marwa and their family. It has been a long and complex journey for them … Their faith and determination have been so important in getting them through the challenges they have faced. We are incredibly proud of them.“We are also incredibly proud of the GOSH team responsible for their treatment and care over the past 10 months. GOSH really is one of the few hospitals in the world with the infrastructure and expertise to carry out a separation like this successfully.”Conjoined twins are very rare – affecting only about one in every 2.5m births.… we have a small favour to ask.

372,"Court asks Hindu girl to distribute Qurans over FB posts, she refuses",A local court in Jharkhand granted college student Richa Bharti bail for purportedly sharing offensive Facebook posts against Muslims and put a condition to distribute five copies of the Quran to government-owned educational organisations. The court also asked Bharti to present a copy to the complainant. She has refused to abide by the condition set by the court for bail.,The Financial Express,"A local court in Jharkhand has granted bail to a college student, who was arrested for purportedly sharing offensive posts against a community on social media last week with a condition that she donate copies of the Quran. According to Hindustan Times, Richa Bharti, a graduation part three student in Ranchi was granted bail from the court of judicial magistrate Manish Kumar Singh. In his order, Singh also asked Bharti to contribute five copies of the Quran to the government-recognised educational organisations. The court also asked Bharti to present one copy of the Quran to complainant Mansur Khalifa.According to the report, the complaint against Bharti was filed by Khalifa, a member of Sadar Anjuman Committee on July 12, 2019, at Pithoria police station. In her FIR, Khalifa stated that Bharti had posted an objectionable post on both Facebook and WhatsApp. Khalifa further stated that the posts may affect the communal harmony of the society.Acting on the complaint, Pithoria police arrested Bharti and sent her to jail on Friday. The entire incident drew criticism from some right-wing Hindu organisations, who also held protests on Sunday demanding immediate release. However, the protest was withdrawn following the assurance given by the rural SP Ashutosh Shekhar that Bharti will be released.Speaking to a local news channel later, Bharti said she was taken aback by the court order and refused to abide by the condition set by the court for her bail. “Today they are asking me to distribute Quran, tomorrow they will ask me to imbibe Islam. Even Muslims post objectionable remarks on social media, have they ever been asked to read Ramayana or Hanuman Chalisa for insulting the Hindu religion?” she told Zee Bihar Jharkhand.A case was filed against Bharti following a complaint against her by Khalifa over a post on Facebook critical of another post on TikTok mentioning “revenge” for the death of Tabrez Ansari, the victim of the Jharkhand mob lynching incident. The court has asked Bharti to distribute copies of the Quran in the presence of officials and furnish acknowledgment slips before it within 15 days.In a similar case on June 29, 2019, a Jharkhand Mukti Morcha leader was arrested for sharing an objectionable post on Goddess Durga on his Facebook page. The incident drew widespread anger among several Durga Puja committees and Hindu organisations. The incident took place at West Singhbhum district’s Chakradharpur town. However, the accused Bhuvneswar Mahato later apologised over sharing the post.On July 14, 2019, the Coimbatore police had arrested Karnataka youth wing secretary of Rashtriya Hindu Mahasabha for sharing a provocative post on the social platform against a particular community.Get live Stock Prices from BSE and NSE and latest NAV, portfolio of Mutual Funds, calculate your tax by Income Tax Calculator, know market’s Top Gainers, Top Losers & Best Equity Funds.

Oil imports in June dropped 13.3% to $11 billion, partly due to low oil prices.",Livemint,"India’s merchandise exports contracted for the first time in nine months in June while imports shrank first time in four months, signalling that rising protectionism and trade tensions between the US and China are impacting India’s trade prospects as well.Data released by the commerce ministry showed exports in June fell 9.71% to $25.01 billion while imports dipped 9.06% to $40.29 billion, leaving behind a trade deficit of $15.28 billion during the month.Comparatively, China’s exports in June fell 1.3%, while imports shrank 7.3%, leading to a trade surplus of $50.98 billion, significantly higher than what analysts projected.Commerce secretary Anup Wadhawan said the temporary shutdown of ONGC Mangalore Petrochemical Ltd and Jamnagar refinery for maintenance in June adversely impacted exports of petroleum products.“The shutdown of Jamnagar refinery is likely to abate by mid-July. The fall in the global Brent price by 15.6% in June is also a factor in the declining value of petroleum product exports,"" he added.During June, petroleum exports declined 33% while non-oil, non-gems and jewellery exports contracted by 4.86%.Among other major items, exports of gems and jewellery (10.7%), readymade garments (-9.18%), chemicals (-8.17%) and engineering goods (-2.65%) also contracted.“The negative growth in June is also consistent with certain global trends, which have impacted India’s exports in recent months.

It had cautioned that these estimates could be revised downward if trade conditions continue to deteriorate.The International Monetary Fund also cut the global growth forecast for 2019 by 20 basis points to 3.3%, the lowest since the 2008 financial crisis, blaming the US-China trade tensions, loss of momentum in Europe and the uncertainty surrounding Brexit.The commerce ministry is contemplating an export promotion scheme, along with a production-based support scheme, to boost Make in India as part of its 100-day action plan.The new export promotion scheme may replace the existing Merchandise Export from India Scheme, following the US decision to challenge India’s existing export subsidy schemes at the WTO.",https://www.livemint.com/news/india/amid-trade-tensions-india-s-june-exports-fall-9-7-to-25-billion-1563199917049.html?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

Once the chief executive officer at US Airways, Gangwal and his affiliates, own 37% of InterGlobe Aviation Ltd., which operates IndiGo, while his partner’s company holds a little more at 38%. A representative for Bhatia’s InterGlobe Enterprises Ltd. didn’t immediately respond to a request seeking comments.The primary reason for the fight is the controlling rights held by Bhatia which Gangwal alleges allows his partner to push through related-party transactions in violation of rules. Bhatia’s firm, which has interest in a chain of hotels across India, has said all transactions are executed at an arms’ length basis and in a transparent manner.“IndiGo has become too big and too critical a company for the country.

378,Facebook hires ex-Vine GM for new experimental apps division,"Facebook has hired former Vine GM Jason Toff as the Project Management Director for its recently announced experimental apps division, New Product Experimentation (NPE) Team. Toff left Vine in 2016 and was most recently working for Google as a Partner for its Area 120 incubator, where employees work on experimental projects. Toff will be joining Facebook in next two weeks.",TechCrunch,"Is Facebook  preparing to launch a serious competitor to TikTok? If so, the company just picked up some key talent to make that happen. Last week, Facebook announced plans for a new division, called the NPE Team, which will build experimental consumer-focused apps where it will try different ideas and features, then see how people react. Now, Facebook has picked up former Vine GM Jason Toff to join the NPE Team as a product management director.Toff’s experience also includes time spent at Google,  most notably as a product lead for YouTube before exiting to Vine  in 2014. At the short-form video app maker, Toff worked as head of Product for a year, then became Vine’s general manager.Vine, of course, was later snatched up by Twitter — and there, Toff moved up to director of Product Management before boomeranging back to Google, where his initial focus was on AR and VR projects.Most recently, Toff worked as a partner at Google’s Area 120, Google’s in-house incubator where employees work on experimental projects.That’s not all that different from what Facebook appears to have in store with its own NPE Team ambitions. Similar to Area 120 or Microsoft Garage, for example, the NPE Team plans to deliver apps that will “change very rapidly” in response to consumer feedback. It also will be quick to close down experiments that aren’t useful to people in fairly short order.That’s not how Facebook itself operates. Its more experimental apps have had longer runs, as the company used them to gain feedback to inform its larger projects. For example, its photo-sharing app Moments ran from 2015 through early 2019, and its TrueCaller-like app Hello for emerging markets ran for several years, despite fairly limited adoption.Facebook has also tried and failed with a number of other offshoots over the past decade, like Facebook Paper, Notify, a Snapchat clone called Lifestage and others, as well as those it picked up through acquisitions, then later shut down like tbh or Moves. It also previously ran an internal incubator of sorts called Facebook Creative Labs, which birthed now-failed projects like Slingshot, Riff and Rooms.Many of these efforts were fairly high-profile at launch, which made their eventual shut down more problematic for Facebook’s image. With the NPE Team — as with Area 120 or Microsoft Garage — there’s a layer of separation between the test apps and the larger company. Many of the apps that the NPE Team puts out will bomb, and that’s the point — it wants to get the failures out of the way faster so others can find success.While Toff can’t yet say what he’ll be working on at Facebook, there’s a lot of speculation that the NPE Team will try to come up with some sort of answer to TikTok, the Beijing-based short-form video app that sucked up Musical.ly in 2018 and now is a Gen Z social networking hit, with some 500 million-plus monthly users. Toff’s background with Vine could certainly be helpful if that were the case.Facebook, of course, already tried to get a TikTok clone off the ground with Lasso, but the experiment didn’t take off and the app lead, Brady Voss, left Facebook soon after its launch.Toff says he’s hiring for the NPE Team, including both UX designers and engineers.",https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/15/facebook-snags-former-vine-gm-to-run-product-for-its-new-experimental-app-division-npe-team/?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

387,Russian defence system will be fully deployed by Apr 2020: Turkey,"Turkish President Tayyip Erdoğan said on Monday that the Russian S-400 missile defence system, parts of which have been delivered to Turkey over the past four days, would be fully deployed in April 2020. ""The S-400s are the strongest defence system against those who want to attack our country,"" he added. US has threatened to sanction Turkey over the purchase.",Reuters,"ISTANBUL (Reuters) - Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan said on Monday that the Russian S-400 missile defence system, parts of which have been delivered to Turkey over the past four days, would be fully deployed in April 2020. Turkey’s purchase of the Russian system has raised tensions with its NATO allies, particularly the United States, which has warned Turkey that it will respond with sanctions. Speaking at Istanbul’s Ataturk Airport on the third anniversary of 2016’s attempted coup, Erdogan said eight planes had already brought parts of the Russian system and more were coming, as he had repeatedly promised. “With God’s permission, they will have been installed in their sites by April 2020,” he told the crowd. “The S-400s are the strongest defence system against those who want to attack our country. God willing, we are doing this as a joint investment with Russia, and will continue to do so.” U.S. officials have said that in addition to being hit with legislation aimed at preventing countries from purchasing military equipment from Russia, known as CAATSA, Turkey could be thrown off the F-35 stealth fighter jet program. That would mean it would no longer make F-35 parts or be able to buy the jets it has ordered. On Sunday, Erdogan said that U.S. President Donald Trump has the authority to waive sanctions on Turkey for its purchase of Russian air defence systems and should find a “middle ground” in the dispute. Tensions between Turkey and Western allies have risen in recent months over the purchase of the S-400 system, with a series of other actions taken by the NATO member state compounding the situation.  German and Austrian ministers said on Monday that the European Union would endorse a symbolic punishment for Turkey over what it calls “illegal” drilling for oil and gas off Cyprus and threaten harsher sanctions unless Ankara changes tack. Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu had said on Sunday that Turkey will continue drilling for gas in waters off Cyprus if the internationally recognised Greek Cypriot government does not accept a cooperation proposal put forward by Turkish Cypriots. After sacking the central bank governor this month, citing differences over the timing of rate cuts, Erdogan said on Sunday that Turkey would make serious cuts to interest rates and aims to reduce inflation to single digits by the end of the year. In his first remarks since taking office nine days ago, new governor Murat Uysal was reported as hinting at rate cuts, saying there was “room for manoeuvre” in monetary policy. Turkey’s benchmark interest rate was hiked to 24% last September to stem a sharp fall in the lira and has remained there to prevent renewed losses in the currency as the economy tumbled into recession. Ratings agency Fitch downgraded Turkey’s sovereign rating to BB- on Friday, saying the central bank chief’s dismissal heightened doubt over the authorities’ tolerance for a period of slower growth. On Monday, agency S&P Global said Turkey’s credit rating is only likely to be affected by U.S. sanctions if they specifically target the country’s banks.

The 27-year-old has reportedly confessed to the murder, with the police saying sexual abuse was a likely motive. The body of Eaton, a molecular biologist, was found by the Greek authorities inside a bunker used by the Nazis during WWII.",Daily Mail,"Suzanne Eaton (pictured) body was found deep at the bottom of a caveA man has been arrested for the murder of American biologist Suzanne Eaton. He is a 27-year-old father of two, DailyMail.com can reveal.Police sources said he was arrested over the weekend and has reportedly confessed to killing Dr Eaton. Detective believed that only a local person would have known the locality of the hidden cave, which was a former Nazi bunker. The detained man is believed to come from Maleme, which is a only a few miles from the hidden 200-feet long cave’s location. Sources said police believed the suspect, a local farmer, had a sexual motive.Dr Eaton was attacked as she walked back to the convention center she had been staying at.‘He hit her with his car to stop her from running and then stabbed her’ said the source.Police found him by tracing his cell phone to the area and found his car tracks near the cave.  Dr Eaton's body landed face down, around 200 feet inside the labyrinth of passages that pass through this cave (pictured)Local villagers said they believed only somebody from the area would have known about the cave, which is off a dust track and then involves a trek through rugged woodland and is not visible easily to the naked eye or from the roadPolice believe she was picked up from the road outside the fishing village of Afrata and suffocated, before being dumped through a shaft into the caveDr. Eaton's body was found deep at the bottom of a cave which was used by Nazis to store ammunition during the second World War.Crete has groups of Nazi fanatics and supporters who trade in memorabilia and souvenirs left behind by soldiers.Police believe the location of the caves would only have been known to a few around there and particularly those with an interest in Nazi background.   It comes as Dr Eaton's family pay heartfelt tributes to her.Her mother, son Max, brother Rob and her sister have broken their silence to remember the 59-year-old scientist who was suffocated and stabbed after going out walking. Her mother Glynda said: ‘She was a devoted wife and mother, and dearly loved by her family. ‘From the day Suzanne was brought to me right after she was born - stuffed into a red Christmas stocking, December 23 - not drowsy and sleepy but with her head up, her eyes alert, that interest in everything around her has never changed.‘It has been a joy to share her love of books and music, to observe the combination of a certain flamboyancy with a calm, thoughtful, steady personality.‘Her accomplishments are many and varied: avid gardener, accomplished pianist, black belt in Taekwondo, and of course her contributions to developmental biology.’Dr Eaton left the Orthodox academy for a run and was discovered in a World War II cave near the settlement of Xamoudochori on Monday nighOne of her two sons Max added that he would always ‘cherish’ her memory.He added: ‘My mother was a remarkable woman.‘She managed to live a life with few regrets, balancing out her personal life with her career.‘I think the fact that I did not realize how well she had managed to do so was evident that other mothers around me had taken to caring for their children full time, yet mine was never outdone by any of them.‘Supportive and encouraging, she nurtured and supported anything that the distractible mind of my childhood would come up with, and this curiosity has stuck with me to this day.‘As I grew, her brilliance as a scientist began to dawn on me. Always armed with a question, she would show interest in any topic broached.‘Many a time I discussed topics with her that I had studied at university, and within a week, she would be as well versed in that topic as any of my professors.‘Yet she was far more than a scientist. Her love for music shone brightly, her eyes lit up every time she talked about a piece she was playing, and she would laugh with me in admiration of the sheer complexity of a piano arrangement.‘I have many fond memories of her and my father playing duets together, filling our home with a beautiful, joyful sound that was unique to them, and I shall forever cherish the memory of lying on the floor, watching and listening to the thing that brought them together.’Dr Eaton’s younger sister, in a written tribute, said: ‘Sue is too great a person for her legacy to be defined in any way by how we lost her.‘I can’t help but think that if Suzanne were here, she would know how to write this statement.‘She was good with words and it didn’t matter if it was a personal expression of grief or joy or a scientific paper on endocannabinoids.‘She took great pleasure in preparing exquisite meals and had an exotic fashion sense.‘She loved perfume. She taught and practiced Taekwondo as a second degree black belt. She finished crossword puzzles way too quickly, played concertos, and read extensively.‘She fitted Jane Austin’s strictest description of an ""accomplished woman"" while maintaining a natural humility and ""insatiable curiosity"".‘She worried that it was impossible to give both her science and her family her all. But anyone who read of her accomplishments in the field of molecular and developmental biology, or who witnessed her joy in tutoring, comforting, and inspiring her children, or sharing with, and loving her husband, would not have suspected.‘With a deep sensitivity and compassion, she somehow made us all a priority.‘We are immensely proud of her. It was her words that finally helped me deal with death, and she was in the process of teaching me how to live. So, I will continue on that journey.‘I have made a conscious decision not to allow those facts to haunt my memory. My memory will be one of pure joy and gratitude, of love and admiration for an arm in arm sister, a closest confidant, a strong, kind, brilliant, selfless human being who made indelible contributions to science and added immeasurable beauty to our lives.Her brother Rib said: ‘I have lost a sister. The world has lost more than it will ever know. Suzanne brought a new perspective to everything.‘As a scientist she would pull together the threads of common knowledge from other disciplines to create profound new understandings in her own. As a chef she could make the most exotic dish seem simple and homey.'I will miss our animated conversations. I would always walk away with a head full of new ideas and enthusiasm. Most of all I will miss the kindest, wisest person I will probably ever know.’  An 85-year-old gardener and an elderly fisherman have both independently told detectives they saw Dr Eaton in the village of Afrata, which is three miles from the place she had been staying.Officers now believe Dr Eaton disappeared a mile outside of Afrata as she made her way back to the Orthodox Academy of Crete where she was due to be a keynote conference speaker. Police have questioned several people and detained possible suspects, believing they are close to finding Dr Eaton's killer, DailyMail.com can reveal She had fought for her life against an attacker armed with a knife, and suffered substantial knife wounds to her body, police sources told ABC. The witnesses are adamant she came into the picturesque former fishing village, which does not have street surveillance cameras and is surrounded by cliffs and olive fields, before turning back towards the academy.The retired gardener, who asked not to be identified, told DailyMail.com: 'I saw her and I recognized her from the photographs of her. I also told police correctly the pink and purple colors of her clothing.'She was walking quite fast near a bridge and small church on the road out of the village. I was walking and she walked past me. I am sad about what has happened to her.'It is believed she met her killer or killers on the road out of Afrata and may have become exhausted in the 90-degree heat and through having walked four miles.She had walked north out of the academy and her body was found about six miles away south of the academy in a cave which had been a Nazi bunker during the Second World War.It is thought she was picked up from the road outside Afrata and suffocated and stabbed, before being dumped through a shaft into the cave at Xamoudochori. Her body had still not been released to her British husband and forensic tests are being conducted to see if she had been raped.Coroner Antonis Papadomanolakis told local news outlets: 'Her death was not immediate. It is not like in a shooting. There was duration involved.'One of the last people to see her alive, Katerina Karkala-Zormpa of the Orthodox Academy of Crete, told DailyMail.com: 'She was in a good mood and laughing as she came through the reception.'She played the piano and then went out. She always felt safe here and it was her fourth visit.'She felt so comfortable here, she left her room unlocked with the key inside and her belongings.''It was a great shock when we heard that she was missing. She used to take walks whenever she was here and I could not believe she had got lost,' Karkala-Zormpa said. 'Her family came here and worked so hard to find her. They were always sending emails and on the telephone and helping the search.Her body had still not been released to her British husband Tony Hyman (pictured) and forensic tests are being conducted to see if she had been raped 'It was so sad when her body was discovered but in some way it was a relief because at least they knew what had happened. Of course they wanted to find her alive, but after a week they just needed to know.''After she had died, we found out what a brilliant scientist she was and the incredible research she had done. She was very modest and did not make a big deal about her achievements,' she added. 'The whole matter had been very difficult and we hope the killer or killers are found as soon as possible.'She said Dr Eaton was an experienced and fit hiker and would not normally have accepted a ride from strangers.Police are also talking to cell phone companies on Crete that the murderer or murderers possibly had on them when they suffocated and stabbed her before dumping her body.Authorities are trying to establish whether a phone signal was picked up by cell phone masts close to the remote olive fields where her body was found.Crucially, they have pin-pointed a two-hour period on the night of Tuesday, July 2 when several phone signals were picked up in an area which they believe would have been known to them and few from outside the area.DailyMail.com previously revealed that officers, in the days after the mother-of-two's body was found, walked around the former Nazi bunker, talking to Greece's three major phone companies, Cosmote, Vodafone and Wind, from their own cell phones.They talked with the phone companies' technicians and engineers while moving around the woodland and asking whether their locations were identifiable.This is the Orthodox Academy of Crete where Dr Eaton was hosted while attending a conference and was due to be a keynote speaker Katerina Karkala-Zormpa (pictured), of the Orthodox academy, was one of the last people to see her alive and  told DailyMail.com she was 'in a good mood and laughing' before her final runA source said: 'They did this because they wanted to test close to the cave their own phones and co-ordinates and then with the help of GPS mapping and computer data find out which other mobile phones have been in that area in the last week.'It is a lonely spot and there is no reason really except for hikers or cave explorers, for anybody to go there.'If the killers had their phone, they think that is enough to find them.'There cannot be very many people who go there and if that is the evening her body was left there, they will be looking for the owners of the cell phones picked up in the area during that time.'Those visiting the area found strong 4G signal strength on their cell phones, boosted by two towering phone masts nearby.It was also revealed that the killer dumped the body of Dr Eaton, which was still dressed in her running gear, down a shaft, an approximate 40-foot drop.They did so by removing a wooden pallet from the shaft and dropping the body down where it landed face down, around 200ft inside the labyrinth of passages that pass through the cave. Police and forensic officers have carried out a thorough examination of the cave, close to Xamoudochori and their discarded plastic gloves and other debris littered the opening to the cave, which is partially blocked by a fallen tree and accessible only on all fours. ",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-7249367/Greek-police-arrest-man-27-murder-biologist-Crete.html?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

The credit card bills were presented as evidence against Razak, who allegedly diverted over ₹4,804 crore from the state-run 1MDB wealth fund to his personal bank accounts.",The Guardian,"Credit cards belonging to the disgraced former prime minister of Malaysia were used to spend more than $800,000 at a jeweller in Italy in a single day, a court in Kuala Lumpur has heard during his corruption trial.The spending spree took place at De Grisogono, a Swiss luxury jeweller, in Italy on 8 August 2014 where items worth 3.3m Malaysian Ringgit ($803,000 or £645,000) were purchased on Najib Razak’s Visa and Mastercard platinum credit cards, the court was told.A few months later, 466,000 Malaysian Ringgit ($108,000) was spent at a Chanel boutique in Hawaii and 127,000 Malaysian Ringgit at Bangkok’s luxury Shangri-La hotel using the same credit cards. All the payment were made from Najib’s Ambank account, prosecutors said.The credit card bills were presented as evidence in the trial of the former Malaysian prime minister, who was toppled from power in May last year and is now facing dozens of charges for corruption, misappropriation of funds and abuse of power linked to government fund 1MDB.The trial, relating to the misuse of a subsidiary fund called SRC, is the first of several that Najib is due to face in the coming months for his alleged role in the scandal.Under Najib’s watch, it is alleged upwards of $4bn was embezzled from 1MDB and spent around the world, funding films, yachts, real estate and celebrity parties. It is alleged $681m (£516m) went into Najib’s personal bank account and was used to fund the lavish spending habits of Najib and his wife Rosmah Mansour. Najib and Rosmah, who is also facing multiple charges, both deny all wrongdoing.The opulent lifestyle of Najib and Rosmah was a source of much resentment in Malaysia during Najib’s time as prime minister and after their arrest there was a collective revulsion when raids on the couple’s family properties uncovered a cache of luxury goods worth $273m, including 1,400 necklaces, 567 handbags, 423 watches, 2,200 rings, 1,600 brooches and 14 tiaras, the biggest seizure in Malaysian history.Najib defended the credit card spending as purchases for official purposes. “This spending is for gifts to a senior member of the royalty of a government and their entourage that has good relations with our country,” Najib wrote in a Facebook post late on Monday. He did not clarify which royal had received the jewellery. “It is a norm to give gifts to leaders of other governments.”… we have a small favour to ask.

Design of 'The Tulip' was deemed not to be good enough for such a prime location. ""The tower would result in harm to London’s skyline and impact views of the nearby Tower of London world heritage site,"" Khan's office said.",The Guardian,"Plans to build a 300-metre (1,000ft) skyscraper dubbed “the Tulip” in the City of London near the Thames have been thrown out by the capital’s mayor, Sadiq Khan.The building, designed by Norman Foster’s architectural practice, would have been the second tallest in western Europe, but its design was deemed not to be good enough for such a prime location.The project’s backers had said it would attract 1.2 million visitors a year but its detractors worried it would damage some of London’s most recognisable historical views.The scheme had initially received the go-ahead but Khan dashed the hopes of its designers, Foster + Partners, on Monday. “The mayor has a number of serious concerns with this application and having studied it in detail has refused permission for a scheme that he believes would result in very limited public benefit,” Khan’s spokesman said.“In particular, he believes that the design is of insufficient quality for such a prominent location, and that the tower would result in harm to London’s skyline and impact views of the nearby Tower of London world heritage site. The proposals would also result in an unwelcoming, poorly designed public space at street level.”The chief executive of Historic England, Duncan Wilson, had expressed similar concerns when the City of London Corporation (CoLC) approved the plans in April.“This building, a lift shaft with a bulge on top, would damage the very thing its developers claim they will deliver – tourism and views of London’s extraordinary heritage,” Wilson said.“The setting of the Tower of London, a symbol of the city not just to millions of Londoners but to the whole world and one of our most visited places, will be harmed. It has already been damaged by the Walkie Talkie and it would be a great shame if that mistake was repeated.”But the CoLC described it as a “truly unique visitor attraction” that would help the City, which is relatively quiet on weekends, attract more visitors.… we have a small favour to ask.

414,No plan to replace New Pension Scheme with old scheme: Govt,State Finance Minister Anurag Thakur on Monday informed the Lok Sabha that there is no proposal to replace the New Pension Scheme (NPS) with the old pension scheme for central and state government employees recruited since 2004. Employees have been demanding the old pension scheme as it was based on a fixed pension amount and provided more security upon retirement.,India.com,"New Delhi: The Centre ruled out any possibility of replacing the new pension scheme (NPS) with the old pension scheme (OPS) that was in force before 2004. In a written reply to a question in this regard, Minister of State for Finance & Corporate Affairs Anurag Thakur said, “There is no proposal to replace the NPS with old pension scheme in respect of Central Government employees recruited on or after 01.01.2004.”No OPS due to rising and unsustainable pension bill
NPS does not provide a guaranteed pension
NPS mandatory for  employees joined on or after Jan 1, 2004There has been a demand from several quarters, including trade unions and pressure groups, to reintroduce the ops as it provides more security to the retired employees than the new one. However, the government category denied all speculations, citing the reasons “due to rising and unsustainable pension bill, the Government had made a conscious move to shift from the defined benefit, pay-as-you-go pension scheme to defined contribution pension scheme now called as National Pension System (NPS). The transition also helped in freeing the limited resources of the Government for more productive and socio-economic sectoral development.”The NPS based on the contribution of the employees was introduced in 2004 and since then it has been facing opposition as employee unions of central and state governments find the OPS better as it was based on fixed pension amount.The biggest point of opposition to the NPS is that it doesn’t provide guaranteed pension to its subscribers and the unsustainable pension bill on the exchequer is the main reason the government doesn’t want the OPS back.All government employees who joined the service on or after January 1, 2004, fall under the NPS based on the defined contribution with two tiers – Tier-I and II. Contribution to Tier-I is mandatory for all Government servants (except the armed forces in the first stage), whereas Tier-II will be optional and at the discretion of Government servants.",https://www.india.com/business/no-proposal-to-replace-new-pension-scheme-with-old-pension-scheme-government-3718237/?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

After all, isn't age just a number?And while Anupam Kher continues to set such a bright example for the youth, it is only important for everyone to know his story and the hurdles that he has overcome with hardwork and confidence to achieve his dreams. In interaction with Humans Of Bombay, Anupam Kher narrates his story stating, ""When I was young, I asked my grandfather why we were so happy despite being poor. He said, ‘Happiness is our cheapest luxury’. My dad was very optimistic–when I ranked 59 out of 60 in school, he said I could always do better next time! It was this celebration of failures that made me unstoppable"", he narrates adding how there were several instances when he was forced to give up but he didn't... Mentioning how there were days when he had no house, no money, Anupam Kher said, ""I got my calling when I acted in a play in 9th grade. I couldn't say my lines well, so they were given to someone else. But during the play, he forgot to say them! So I made something up in my broken English–the audience was in splits!  I loved being on stage & wanted to act full time. I saw an Ad for a course in Chandigarh & needed Rs.100 for the audition. I stole it from my mom & told her I was going for a picnic. Thankfully, I was accepted! So I went to Chandigarh to study acting. I was a teacher for 2 years, before I saw an ad that a drama school in Mumbai was hiring. When I got here, I realised they had no money–they gave me a small space to teach & a tiny room to stay. I didn’t want to go back a failure. So I taught there, while auditioning & performing in plays. It was hard–at one point I had no work, money or help. I had to live on beaches & sleep on platforms. I didn’t want to worry my parents, so I wrote to my granddad that I wanted to come back. But he replied, ‘A man who’s already drenched in water, shouldn’t be scared of rains’–I didn’t give up!""  Explaining how a film changed his life despite having lost it to someone else, he said, ""It’s good that I didn't, because soon, I got a role in a Mahesh Bhatt film. I got money & a place to stay. But later, I was told I was replaced. I called Mahesh Bhatt & he said it was true. I couldn’t take it & decided to go home. But first, I met Mahesh Bhatt & told him no one would play the part better than me–he was making a mistake. So he told the producers he wouldn’t make the film without me–he saw the vigour with which I wanted to act. That’s how I got my first film. Today I’ve done over 500 films. It’s been a bumpy ride, but everyday, I thank my failures for bringing me this far. I thank all the people who said no to me, all the people who didn’t help me–because if it weren’t for them I wouldn’t have pushed myself to get where I am today…a place where my dreams are now my reality.""Anupam Kher was recently seen in One Day: Justice Delivered, a film that received immense praises from critics and audiences alike. ",https://www.timesnownews.com/entertainment/news/bollywood-news/article/i-had-to-live-on-beaches-sleep-on-platforms-anupam-kher-on-struggles-that-turned-his-dream-into-reality/454341?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

""This would be the right time for Rohit to take over ODI captaincy. We all know some areas need a re-look,"" he added. He further said that the board will get to bottom of the rumours.",Hindustan Times,"Ever since India’s ouster in the semi-final of the ICC World Cup, there has been a lot of talk about the areas where the team lacked and also how it was too reliant on the duo of skipper Virat Kohli and his deputy Rohit Sharma when it came to scoring runs. While this has been an area that is also highlighted from the scoring charts of the World Cup, another factor that the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) is also keen to discuss is the idea of split captaincy.Speaking to IANS, a board functionary said that good teams start preparations immediately after one campaign ends and the biggest result of that is England winning the World Cup on Sunday. So, keeping an eye on the next campaign, India too could look at the option of having Rohit lead the team in the shorter format while Kohli continues in Tests.ALSO READ: ICC World Cup Team of the Tournament: Men who ruled the roost“This would be the right time for Rohit to take over the mantle of the captaincy in the 50-over format. There has been immense support to the present captain and the management and it is time to plan ahead for the next World Cup and for that the existing ideas and plans need a fresh look. We all know some areas need a re-look.

Captain Virat Kohli and pacer Jasprit Bumrah are expected to be rested for limited-overs leg comprising three T20Is and three ODIs, as per reports. Talking about MS Dhoni's future, a BCCI official said, ""Only he can decide whether he wants to carry on or not.""",The Financial Express,"The Indian team for next month’s tour of West Indies will be announced on July 19 but there is no clarity over the future of Mahendra Singh Dhoni ahead of the limited-overs leg beginning August 3.Dhoni’s future has been widely speculated ever since India lost to New Zealand in the World Cup semifinal on July 9. The 38-year-old is expected to make an announcement on it in the coming few days.“The selectors will meet in Mumbai on July 19. We have not heard from Dhoni but what is relevant is the communication between the player and selectors. If you ask me, Dhoni did well in the Word Cup but he is his own man. Only he can decide whether he wants to carry on or not,” a BCCI official told PTI after the Committee Of Administrators’ meeting here.Skipper Virat Kohli and pace spearhead Jasprit Bumrah are expected to be rested for the limited-overs leg comprising three T20s and as many ODIs before returning for the two-Test series starting August 22. The five-day matches will be part of the inaugural World Test Championship.There is also no official word on the availability of opener Shikhar Dhawan who is recovering from a thumb injury that cut short his World Cup campaign.It was COA’s first meeting since India’s heartbreaking loss at Manchester but the Vinod Rai-led committee did not discuss the team’s performance.However, the three-member panel and CEO Rahul Johri, who joined in via video conferencing as he remains in London for the ICC meetings, did discuss the issue of players picking and choosing games.Former greats like Sunil Gavaskar had questioned the BCCI for allowing the likes of Dhoni and Shikhar Dhawan to skip domestic cricket in the run-up to the World Cup.“The question arises that who is allowing the players to pick and choose? Are they taking the call themselves or are they duly informing the selectors? The general feeling is that there needs to better communication on this issue,” said another BCCI official.“You can’t pick and choose.

From hitting nadir to reaching zenith, no cricketer in recent times would have gone through an entire gamut of emotions like Stokes.""The atmosphere, the emotion that was going through the whole game, he managed to deal with that in an extremely experienced manner. And obviously, everybody watching at home will hopefully try and be the next Ben Stokes,"" Morgan couldn't have paid a bigger compliment to the Man of the Final.He was on his hunches when Carlos Brathwaite hit him for those sixes under a smoky Calcutta skyline during a World T20 final three summers back. His career could have ended that day and Morgan couldn't agree more.""Yes and I have said that a number of times about Ben. I think a lot of careers would have been ended after what happened in Calcutta,"" Morgan reiterated. Funnily ironical but all of England's premier all-rounders over the years have had colourful lives bordering on controversy.
Whether it is Ian Botham smoking cannabis or an inebriated Andrew Flintoff hitting the sea and trying to paddle a boat, they have never been the establishment's favourite child.Stokes is no exception as he was found doing a Rocky Balboa in front of a Bristol pub a couple of years ago. He floored a few with perfect right hooks and then stood in the court room in front of the judge. Another premature ending loomed but the 'Big Ben' is destiny's child. And then Lord's happened -- a World Cup final and he did everything.""To come through it is extraordinary. He's (Stokes) is almost superhuman. He has really carried the team and our batting line-up,"" Morgan was beaming for once while showing a dour face during other times.""I know Jos and his partnership was extraordinary, but to bat with the lower order the way he did I thought was incredible,"" he showered praise. Tired, sweaty and exhausted after a tie, he came out again, ran a three, hit a six, got a score for Super Over.And just when one thought he has done everything, he reminded young Jofra Archer: ""One over won't define who you are"". That was enough to bowl one good ball that ensured a World Cup win. From Sunday, the legend of Stokes will only grow.And Morgan attributed it to the all-rounder's qualities as a team-man. ""Ben, on numerous occasions, has stood up individually and in a unit for us. He leads the way in training, in any team meetings we have, and he's an incredible cricketer. ""And today he's had a huge day out and obviously we are thankful for that,"" said 'Captain' Morgan, ready to raise a toast for his asset. ",https://www.timesnownews.com/sports/cricket/article/icc-world-cup-2019-all-those-who-watched-ben-stokes-fight-should-try-to-emulate-him-england-skipper-eoin-morgan/454104?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

473,Bigg Boss Telugu organiser asked how I could live without sex: Actress,"Actress Gayathri Gupta has filed a complaint against Bigg Boss Telugu organisers alleging that they cheated her and hurt her self-respect by asking inappropriate questions. She claimed that during her meeting with the show's coordinator from Mumbai, he asked her how she could live for 100 days without sex. Gayathri further alleged her contract for the show was abruptly terminated.",The News Minute,"A few days after journalist Swetha Reddy filed a complaint against the Bigg Boss Telugu organisers alleging  sexual harassment, actor Gayathri Gupta too has filed a complaint against STAR MAA- Bigg Boss coordinators. The actor has filed a police complaint alleging that she was cheated and one of the organisers hurt her by asking inappropriate personal questions.In her complaint submitted to the Banjara Hills police on July 14, Gayathri says she had received a call from Raghu, one of STAR MAA’s coordinators, with a proposal to participate in the season three of Bigg Boss show. Gayathri agreed to the proposal and met Ravikanth, Raghu and another HR person from the channel a couple of times at various locations in Hyderabad until June.Speaking to TNM, Gayathri says that during her final conversation with the show's team, Abhishek, the show’s coordinator from Mumbai, had also come down and met her at her house in Manikonda.“We decided on the payment and I also signed the agreement papers which clearly stated that I couldn’t take up any other project until the completion of the 100 days inside the Bigg Boss house. Keeping the same in mind, they blocked my dates and I rejected a couple of film offers that had come my way,” Gayathri adds.“Abhishek then went on to ask me if I was ready to stay away from my phone and asked how I could live for 100 days without sex. I didn’t understand why he had to ask me such a personal and inappropriate question. Abhishek then asked me what I could do in order to impress the “boss”,” the actor alleges.Gayathri says Abhishek didn’t mention who the boss was and according to the FIR filed, on June 25 she received a call from Ravikanth stating that she was no longer a part of the Bigg Boss show.“I had earlier mentioned about my health issue and they had assured that it could be managed, even while signing the agreement papers. When asked why I was terminated, Ravikanth told it was because of my health issue. If it was really an issue, why did they even make me sign the papers and block my dates?” Gaythri asks.An FIR has been registered against Ravikanth and Abhishek under Section 354A (iv) of IPC (making sexually coloured remarks, shall be guilty of the offence of sexual harassment).Gayathri was a presenter with the Telugu channel Sakshi and later started acting in movies. She rose to fame after her roles in Ice-cream 2 and her role as Sai Pallavi's friend in Fidaa.A similar case was filed against the coordinators of STAR MAA, including Ravikanth and Abhishek a few days ago, based on a complaint filed by journalist Swetha Reddy alleging sexual harassment. Swetha had alleged that the Bigg Boss team had fat-shamed her and asked her what she could in order to satisfy the “boss”.“They have cheated and harassed me and I believe that it’s important I come out in the open and bring the issue to the notice of people. I would never want to go back to the show and in fact such reality shows on television should be banned,” Swetha had told TNM. ",https://www.thenewsminute.com/article/another-woman-goes-cops-alleging-harassment-bigg-boss-telugu-organisers-105493?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

The match ended in a tie after 100 overs as both teams scored 241 runs and even the Super Over succeeding it concluded as a tie with both sides making 15 runs. However, it was Eoin Morgan who lifted the trophy as his team had hit more number of boundaries.Not many were convinced with such a conclusion in the tournament but yet the rules were rules. Even before the match ended the way it did, there was a moment of utter confusion and tension and it had gone to England’s favour as well. It was the fourth ball of the 50th over which was being bowled by Trent Boult. England needed 15 runs off the final over and with only six runs taken off the first three, the Three Lions were left to score nine off the last three.AdvertisementBen Stokes was on strike while Adil Rashid was at the other end. Stokes hit the ball on the on-side and ran for two. Martin Guptill was the fielder and as he threw the ball in, it hit Stokes who gave a dive to complete the second run. The deflected ball went for four overthrow runs and the umpire awarded England six runs for that. They needed to score just three off the last two from therefrom.The decision was debated as experts felt England should have been given five runs and not six since the two batsmen had not started for their second run when the ball was released by the fielder. In complete chaos, New Zealand felt things were “uncontrollable” while England were not complaining.The home team skipper, Eoin Morgan, was asked at the post-match conference whether the “luck of an Irishman” got England over the line.

Three people have been named in the FIR of the incident, out of which, two are women. Family members of a patient allegedly attacked the doctors on Saturday after the patient died during treatment. The patient's kin attacked three resident doctors and vandalised hospital property. The police said that efforts are underway to arrest the other two accused. The 46-year-old patient had been undergoing treatment for Tuberculosis and HIV. The doctors who had been attacked claimed that they had informed the patients' family that he was extremely critical when he was brought to the hospital. The deceased had been admitted in ward number 23 of the hospital. When the patient's kin learned about his death, the relatives allegedly entered into the ward and started abusing the doctors. The accused then started assaulting the doctors and security guards. Maharashtra Association of Resident Doctors (MARD) voiced their support towards the doctors and condemned the incident. MARD said that increased violence towards doctors has caused mental stress to the medical fraternity. Following the attack, MARD demanded the formulation of the Central Protection Act for medicos all across the country. The organisation said that necessary amendments should be made in the Doctors Protection Act. They said that security audits should be conducted in government-run hospitals and an emergency alarm system should also be installed to strengthen security. TIn a similar case reported from Jharkhand's Ranchi, the relatives of a patient attacked doctors of the Ranchi Trust Hospital in June. The accused attacked medical superintendent Dr AK Singh, Dr Om Prakash Mahansarai, Dr SK Sinha and Dr Nijam. The patient had been brought to the hospital after he had been involved in a drowning accident in Patratu Dam.

It was founded in 2014 by Melissa Hanna, Linda Hanna and Sunny Walia.",TechCrunch,"Tennis superstar and mom to a 22-month-old, Serena Williams has joined Mark Cuban  to invest $3 million seed funding in Mahmee, a startup working toward filling the critical care gap in postpartum care.For those who’ve never given birth or who (count your blessings!) never had any mishaps in the hospital or afterwards, the weeks and months following childbirth can be extremely hard on the new mom, with estimates as high as one in five women suffering from postpartum depression or anxiety and about 9% of women experiencing post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) following childbirth — and those are just the mood and mental health disorders.Physical recovery, even for those with a healthy, run-of-the-mill birth, takes at least six weeks — eight weeks if you’ve had a C-section. And then there are all the medical complications. Williams, who has a history of blood clots, ended up basically shouting at the doctors to give her a CT scan that saved her life.The real issue, at the heart of all this, according to Mahmee  co-founder Melissa Hanna, is that “the data is fragmented.” She says this is why she built a network to get new moms the support they need — from their community, other moms and medical providers.Mahmee provides not only online group discussions with other moms going through the same thing and at the same stage but also connection to your medical provider. On top of that, it adds support from a trained “maternity coach” who can flag if something is wrong.One example Hanna used was a new mom who was exhibiting symptoms of septic shock. The co-founder says a coach was able to call this mom on the spot and get her to contact her OB-GYN right away.There are other online services like Postpartum Support International (PSI) and the Bloom Foundation, which both provide a sort of digital network and resources for new moms, but Hanna believes it is that missing link to medical professionals after mom has gone home from the hospital that really makes a difference.“We’re so focused on delivering a healthy baby that mom gets side-lined,” she told TechCrunch. Adding in a statement, “And this industry is lacking the IT infrastructure needed to connect these professionals from different organizations to each other, and to follow and monitor patients across practices and health systems. This missing element creates gaps in care. Mahmee is the glue that connects the care ecosystem and closes the gaps.”While other sites mentioned above are free to use, Mahmee, which goes beyond social support to providing engagement and patient monitoring, makes money through group and individual video calls (the introductory session with a coach is free) and various support groups. There are also different payment tiers starting at $20 a month and up toward $200 per month where new parents can ask unlimited questions through a HIPAA-secure, online dashboard connecting them with their medical providers and Mahmee coaches.Do new moms need to pay someone to help them out and monitor them medically after they get home from the hospital? Possibly. Some local hospitals and medical networks also provide various types of help — both through counseling and new parent support groups. But often it can take weeks to get a counseling session at a busy hospital and your OB may have too many patients to call and check up on you. Having this type of support could just save your life — and, if anything else, checking in with a group of moms going through the same thing could be the key to saving your sanity.Hanna admits it’s early days for her startup, but tells TechCrunch there are more than 1,000 providers in the Mahmee network so far. She plans to use the $3 million to grow her team, including engineers, clinicians and sales staff, and hints she’s working on several partnerships within the healthcare industry right now.",https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/15/serena-williams-mark-cuban-invest-3-million-in-mahmee-a-digital-support-network-for-new-moms/?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

However, no solution was found.Daya Shankar of Kabir Ashram in Damakhed told ANI, ""This is a move to promote non-vegetarian food. There are other vegetarian options to fight the problem of malnourishment. In schools, which are the temples of education, no non-vegetarian food should be allowed and we will campaign against it."" Following the opposition, a four-member committee comprising state Home Minister Tamradhwaj Sahu, Education Minister Premsai Singh Tekam, Child and Woman Welfare Minister Anila Bhediya and Urban Administration Minister Shiv Kumar Dahariya held talks with Kabir Panth followers to find a way out.Tekam said, ""In the whole state, child malnutrition is estimated at about 40 per cent. For their well being, we have decided to give them nutrition-rich food. Some organisations including Kabir Panth have sought that egg should not be included in the scheme. We will speak to the Chief Minister (Bhupesh Baghel) and then will take a decision."" Former Chhattisgarh chief minister Raman Singh has demanded that the government should take into consideration religious beliefs before implementing any such decision.""People have their religious beliefs and their feelings are being hurt. The proposal must be reconsidered. Milk also has protein and it can be given to students. There are many other options as well,"" he said.Social activist Mamta Sharma, however, cited statistics on malnutrition in the state to bat for implementing a healthy diet. ""If we see the statistics of the National Health Authority, we will observe that the number of malnourished children is on the rise in Chhattisgarh. Therefore, our children are in need of a healthy diet which includes egg. Children who eat egg can have it while others can choose not to have it.

Vettel had to pit for a new nose for his Ferrari car while Verstappen re-joined the fray and finished fifth, missing out on a possible podium finish.Vettel was given a 10-seconds penalty and two penalty points by the stewards for the crash on lap 37 of the 52-laps race.

517,Oracle loses court appeal against $10 bn US govt contract,"US-based Oracle has lost its legal challenge against US Pentagon's $10-billion contract for 'JEDI' cloud infrastructure, which it alleged unfairly favoured Amazon. The Federal Claims Court said there were no ""organisational conflicts of interest"" and because Oracle didn't meet bid's criteria, it can't allege prejudice in the bidding. The US can now award the contract to Amazon or Microsoft.",Livemint,"Oracle Corp. lost its legal challenge to the Pentagon’s $10 billion cloud contract on Friday, clearing the way for the government to award the contract to Amazon.com Inc. or Microsoft Corp. Federal Claims Court Senior Judge Eric Bruggink dismissed the company’s argument that the contract violates federal procurement laws and is unfairly tainted by conflicts of interests. Bruggink said that because Oracle didn’t meet the criteria for the bid, it “cannot demonstrate prejudice as a result of other possible errors in the procurement process.""The decision is a major blow to Oracle, which risks losing a share of its federal defense business if the Pentagon awards the contract to another cloud company. The ruling eliminates a headache for the Pentagon, which has been fending off challenges to its winner-take-all strategy in the cloud contract for more than a year.“Oracle will likely be most threatened by this"" decision, said Bloomberg Intelligence Analyst James Bach. “They stand to lose the most ground in the Defense market if the DOD decides JEDI is the end-all be-all.""Oracle looks forward to “working with the Department of Defense, the Intelligence Community, and other public sector agencies to deploy modern, secure hyperscale cloud solutions that meet their needs,"" company spokeswoman Deborah Hellinger said in a statement. She didn’t comment on whether the company plans to appeal the decision.Elissa Smith, a Defense Department spokeswoman, said in a statement that the ruling “reaffirms the DOD’s position: the JEDI Cloud procurement process has been conducted as a fair, full and open competition, which the contracting officer and her team executed in compliance with the law.""Amazon Web Services, which was also a defendant in the case, said in a statement that the company “stands ready to support and serve what’s most important – the DoD’s mission of protecting the security of our country.""JEDI ProjectThe project, known as Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure cloud - or JEDI, an acronym intended to evoke “Star Wars"" imagery - is intended to be the Defense Department’s general-purpose cloud for most of its systems and applications.The Pentagon is investing in commercial cloud services, in which computing power and storage are hosted in remote data centers, to consolidate its existing technology products, embrace artificial intelligence and machine learning, and enhance its technical capabilities on the battlefield.Vying for the contract became contentious as legacy tech companies such as Oracle and International Business Machines Corp. waged a fierce lobbying and legal campaign against the Pentagon’s decision to choose just one provider. Although they are long-time government contractors, those companies were late entrants to the cloud computing market and eyed market leader Amazon as a threat to their traditional revenue streams from the Defense Department.In April, the Pentagon eliminated Oracle and IBM from the competition, leaving Amazon and Microsoft as the final contenders. Dana Deasy, the Pentagon’s chief information officer, has said the Defense Department expects to make an award in August.Amazon Web Services was widely seen as the front-runner for the contest because it had already won a $600 million contract from the Central Intelligence Agency that helped it obtain much-needed security approvals. Microsoft is catching up to Amazon through its advancements in winning such clearances, as well as a recent cloud deal with the intelligence community and years of experience working with the Defense Department.Partial VindicationThe ruling is a partial vindication for Pentagon officials who have battled months of allegations that its procurement process was corrupt, including the circulation of a 33-page anti-Amazon dossier around Washington that suggested improper personal relationships had given Amazon an edge. The Defense Department has also faced pressure from lawmakers, who criticized the deal for lacking enough competition from industry.There are still potential hurdles for the Defense Department as it moves forward with the bid. Either Microsoft or Amazon could lodge a challenge of the contract with Government Accountability Office or in the Federal Claims Court if they were to lose. Oracle could also appeal the ruling in the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit.On Friday, Chris Lynch, the former director of the Defense Digital Service, which designed the project, praised his former team for their work on the project.“JEDI will immediately deliver much needed capabilities to the warfighter, deliver incredible capabilities that are built from the best tech, and it will change lives,"" he tweeted. “Couldn’t be more proud.""Contested TermsOracle’s lawsuit, which was filed in December, alleged that the Pentagon’s minimum requirements for the contract as well as its decision to pick just one winner violated federal procurement laws designed to ensure competition. The government has said choosing one winner would reduce security risks and better enable it to consolidate its technology products.The suit also claimed that the procurement has been marred by conflicts of interest, including ties between former Defense Department officials and Amazon. At least two of the former employees were offered jobs at the company while working on the contract, according to the lawsuit.The Pentagon determined in its internal review that the relationships had no adverse impact on the integrity of the acquisition process but said the department’s inspector general was looking into potential unethical conduct. Bruggink said in his ruling that the Defense Department’s determination on the allegations was not “arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law.""This story has been published from a wire agency feed without modifications to the text.

""@ICC has made cricket such a batsmen game...It's all about the batsmen scores and the wickets are treated like the lower caste,"" he added.",Times Now,"The ICC Cricket World Cup 2019 final between England and New Zealand was meant purely for the neutral supporters. An absolute nail-biting thriller, the match went into a Super Over before the hosts were declared the winners. The Black Caps remained in the contest right till the last ball but quite a few strokes of bad luck denied them glory at Lord’s.Many in India sympathized with the Kiwis and called them the “true champions.” Fans were also critical of the ICC rule, according to which, the team with more boundaries is declared the winner in case of a tied Super Over; the said rule became a decider in the high-voltage match that ended with the English team lifting the coveted trophy.Bollywood actor Shahid Kapoor called the criteria for winning “absurd” and said that the “World Cup should have been shared.” Shahid, in a Monday tweet, wrote, “This World Cup should have been shared. If England got more boundaries. New Zealand took more wickets. So the criteria is absurd. All 22 of those boys gave their everything and no one was lesser. Then why do only 11 get to feel like they were the best.”
“I was not supporting either. Just watched a great match. And at the end just felt for the kiwis. England played amazing cricket. But so did the kiwis. They didn’t deserve to be second.  No way,” he said in another post.
Anurag Kashyap, on the other hand, slammed the ICC rule in a series of tweets. The director wrote, “If in a super over a country can win by the virtue of more boundaries then why can a country not win by the virtue of losing lesser wickets in the actual match? There is a serious problem with the your rules @ICC @cricketworldcup”
“Honestly speaking  @ICC has made cricket such a batsmen game and wickets really don’t matter. Its all about the batsmen scores & the wickets are treated like the lower caste.

527,Awarding England 6 runs on overthrow a clear mistake: Simon Taufel,"Ex-umpire Simon Taufel has said awarding England six runs on overthrow in World Cup final was ""a clear mistake"". The five-time ICC best umpire award winner added that England should have been awarded five runs as per the rules. He added that Ben Stokes and Adil Rashid had not crossed for their second run at instant of Martin Guptill's throw.",CricTracker,"It was one heck of a final at Lord’s! England and New Zealand had their moments in the game throughout and eventually, the boundary count decided the winner of the 2019 World Cup. But the moment which saw Ben Stokes unintentionally deflecting the ball to the boundary will go down in the cricketing folklore. It turned the game on its head in the last over and what should’ve been a win for the Kiwis, it went into the super over. England were awarded six runs of that particular delivery and it was a complete mishap on the part of the on-field umpires.A former international umpire and member of the committee that presides over cricket’s rulebook Simon Taufel has now admitted that it was a grave error from the umpires. The incident happened when England needed nine runs off three balls. Stokes swatted the ball to deep mid-wicket which Martin Guptill and threw to the striker’s end in an attempt to run the batsman out.AdvertisementBut Stokes was back for the second run and he dived to save himself only to deflect the ball to the boundary with his bat. It was a game-changing moment as Kumar Dharmasena awarded England six runs. But if the cricket laws are considered, it was a clear mistake from him.According to law 19.8 pertaining to Overthrow or wilful act of fielder which reads: If the boundary results from an overthrow or from the wilful act of a fielder, the runs scored shall be— any runs for penalties awarded to either side— and the allowance for the boundary— and the runs completed by the batsmen, together with the run in progress if they had already crossed at the instant of the throw or act.Ben Stokes and Adil Rashid hadn’t crossed each other for the second run when Martin Guptill threw the ball and the second run should’ve never been considered. To make things worse, Stokes shouldn’t have been on the strike either as the run wasn’t completed and Rashid should have faced the penultimate delivery of the match.“It’s a clear mistake … it’s an error of judgment. They (England) should have been awarded five runs, not six. In the heat of what was going on, they thought there was a good chance the batsmen had crossed at the instant of the throw. Obviously, TV replays showed otherwise,” Simon Taufel said while speaking to foxsports.com.au on Monday.The umpiring standards were questioned throughout the World Cup and the ICC should seriously look into the issue after two top umpires in Dharmasena and Marais Erasmus made a serious error and that too in a World Cup final.",https://www.crictracker.com/awarding-england-six-runs-on-the-overthrow-was-a-clear-mistake-says-simon-taufel/?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

534,Will cut business ties with US firms that sell arms to Taiwan: China,"China's government and companies will cut business ties with US firms involved in selling arms to Taiwan, China's foreign ministry has said. However, the ministry did not specify which companies would be affected. This comes after China threatened to impose sanctions on US firms involved in a deal to sell $2.2-billion worth of tanks, missiles and related equipment to Taiwan.",Reuters,"BEIJING (Reuters) - China’s government and Chinese companies will cut business ties with U.S. firms selling arms to Taiwan, China’s Foreign Ministry said on Monday, declining to give details of the sanctions in a move likely to worsen already poor ties with Washington. China claims self-ruled and democratic Taiwan as its own and has never renounced the use of force to bring it under Beijing’s control. China regularly calls Taiwan the most sensitive issue in its relations with the United States.  Last week, the Pentagon said the U.S. State Department had approved the sale of the weapons requested by Taiwan, including 108 General Dynamics Corp (GD.N) M1A2T Abrams tanks and 250 Stinger missiles, which are manufactured by Raytheon (RTN.N). China said on Friday it would sanction U.S. companies selling weapons to Taiwan but did not elaborate. The latest deal involves $2.2 billion worth of tanks, missiles and related equipment for Taiwan. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said the arms sales were a violation of international law and harmed China’s sovereignty and national security. “China’s government and Chinese companies will not cooperate or have commercial contacts with these U.S. companies,” he told a daily news briefing. “I can’t reveal the details at the moment. But believe this - Chinese people always stress standing by their word.” On Sunday, the ruling Communist Party’s official People’s Daily posted an article on its WeChat account identifying U.S. companies that could be vulnerable to sanctions. They included Honeywell International Inc (HON.N), which makes the engines for the Abrams tanks, and private jets maker Gulfstream Aerospace, which is owned by General Dynamics. China is an important market for both Honeywell and Gulfstream. Honeywell, in a statement sent to Reuters, said the arms deal was “a government-to-government sale, initiated by the United States government”.  “Honeywell has no input into these agreements and has had no direct dealings with Taiwan. We are a component provider and do not decide where the products are used. We see no reason why Honeywell would be potentially sanctioned by the Chinese government.” The other companies did not respond to requests for comment. Ties between China and the United States are already strained over a trade war, which has seen them levy tariffs on each other’s imports. This is not the first time China has said it would sanction U.S. companies selling weapons to Taiwan. China has announced such steps at least twice before - in 2010 and 2015 - but it is unclear if the sanctions were ever imposed. U.S. defense contractors have been barred from dealings with Beijing since China’s bloody crackdown on pro-democracy demonstrators on and around Tiananmen Square in 1989. While its relations with Taiwan are technically unofficial, the United States is required by law to assist Taiwan in its defense and is its main supplier of arms, though France has also previously sold warships and fighter jets to Taiwan. China has been angered as well by the United States allowing Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen to visit last week, on her way to diplomatic allies in the Caribbean. She is due to transit the United States again at the end of her trip next week.

542,Worst not yet over in auto sector: Mahindra MD on sale slump,"The worst isn't yet over for the auto industry amid a slowdown in sales, Mahindra and Mahindra's MD Pawan Goenka said. ""I suggest...government remove the cess on small cars and keep 17% single cess rate for large cars for next four-six months,"" he added. Diesel vehicle costs are expected to rise after BS-VI emission norms come into effect in 2020.",The Financial Express,"By Malini BhuptaThe complete collapse in automobile sales has left many perplexed, with volumes expected to clock a modest 3-5% growth in the new fiscal. In the first three months of the financial year, passenger vehicle sales declined by 18.42%.While several factors have come together to contribute to the sharp decline in sales, Mahindra & Mahindra managing director Pawan Goenka is of the view that it is hard to point to any one reason that can possibly explain the industry’s worst show in 18 years. “Even if I add up all the reasons for the slowdown, it doesn’t explain the kind we are seeing. There is something about this animal called ‘sentiment’ that is causing the slowdown. The concern is that the worst is not over yet,” he said.In October this year, the new safety norms kick in for the auto sector, which will further ratchet up prices of the base variant of small cars by nearly Rs 20,000. Higher costs have already affected purchase decisions of consumers over the last one year, leading to a pile-up of inventory of 500,000 passenger vehicles. While consumers are deferring their purchase decisions, the cost of ownership is expected to rise even further by 2020, when the new BS VI emission norms kick in. The cost of a diesel car is likely to increase from Rs 10 lakh to over Rs 11 lakh.Auto sales have suffered over the last one year due to rise in cost of ownership and tight liquidity conditions. While Goenka believes that the finance minister’s decision to infuse Rs 70,000 crore into public sector banks and the credit guarantee scheme for NBFCs is a great move, they may not be enough to revive demand, he said.According to Goenka, the industry’s growth is not determined by people who can easily finance their purchases. It is the people on the margin who could get loans earlier but now are not getting loans very easily that determine industry’s growth. He believes that the measures announced in the Budget would help resolve the issue of financing, but it may not be enough to revive sales.While Goenka understands that it would be unreasonable to expect the government to cut the GST rate at this stage, he is of the view that the industry needs a shot in the arm. “The thing that has always worked in the past is a one-time reduction for a short period. I am suggesting that the government remove the cess on small cars and keep a single rate of cess of 17% for the large cars for the next four-six months. It won’t be a major loss of revenue. And if this revives the auto industry, the returns will be much more than the cost”.“Scrappage policy, setting aside TDS for above Rs 10 lakh cars, deferring non-critical regulations that add to cost may be other measures that could help without any revenue loss to the government,” he added. In any case, Goenka is optimistic that the industry has weathered many slowdowns and this one, too, will come to pass.Get live Stock Prices from BSE and NSE and latest NAV, portfolio of Mutual Funds, calculate your tax by Income Tax Calculator, know market’s Top Gainers, Top Losers & Best Equity Funds.

The two, as per the actress, met each other in February this year and by June, they made their relationship official via an Instagram post. In a report, the Nayak: The Real Hero actress was quoted as saying, “Yes, we are married. Nawab and I exchanged vows in Delhi, with only our families in attendance. Our loved ones kept asking us why we were delaying it (the marriage). I was simply going with the flow, but then I realised that he is the man I want to spend the rest of my life with, and there is no point in delaying it any further. So, here we are. We had an Arya Samaj wedding, and we will register our marriage this week.” 
Here's the first photo retrieved from Pooja's social media handle.Photo Credit: BCCLSpilling the beans on how they met, she said, “I knew of Nawab by virtue of being in the same profession. However, we strongly connected after we were reintroduced by a common friend in February this year. I guess we reconnected at the right time in our life. We were in the same space emotionally and hit it off instantly.”      Revealing what she liked about him, she told the daily, “I have always respected and liked Nawab, and this time around, I was open to the idea of getting to know him better. A part of me wanted to see if there could be something beyond friendship between us. We share emotional and intellectual compatibility, and we don’t have to explain too much to each other. I like the fact that he is a family person.”Talking about the proposal, she said, “During the initial days of our relationship, there was this one time when he came to pick me up at the airport, and according to him, he wanted to pop the question right then. However, he got nervous and dropped the idea (laughs!). He was ready to propose to me soon after we met. Eventually, he proposed to me in Delhi, and again when he came to meet my parents with his family.”The Haseena Maan Jaayegi actress was earlier married to Sonu Ahluwalia, an LA-based surgeon, for nine years. They parted ways in 2011 and talking about that phase in her life, she said, “Everybody goes through phases. I survived one of the most difficult ones, as I was alone in a foreign country. But then, that’s life, isn’t it? You learn as you grow and your mindset also changes with time. Life is all about learning and getting better. Every relationship is different, what works for one couple might not work for another. But what I have realised with time is to be respectful towards your partner, because what you give is what you receive.”Last seen in the 2017 movie Mirror Game, Pooja wants to take up quality work in India now. “I have been working in American shows, but since I’ll be spending more time in India from now on, I would like to take up quality work here, too,” she said.",https://www.timesnownews.com/entertainment/news/people/article/pooja-batra-confirms-being-married-to-nawab-shah-he-is-the-man-i-want-to-spend-the-rest-of-my-life-with/453887?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts
558,I'll be apologising to NZ for rest of my life: Stokes on deflected four,"Talking about the overthrow incident in last over of 2019 World Cup final, England all-rounder Ben Stokes said he told New Zealand captain Kane Williamson that he'd be apologising to them for the rest of his life. The ball had raced to the boundary for four overthrows after deflecting off Stokes' bat. The 28-year-old was named man of the final.",Daily Mail,"Ben Stokes has joked that he will be 'apologising for the rest of my life' after the incredible sequence of events that led to England tying the cricket World Cup final against New Zealand - and then claiming a historic victory in the subsequent super over. Stokes was at the crease when, with just two balls to go, he desperately lunged to make his ground only for Martin Guptill's throw from the deep to hit his bat and ricochet to the boundary for four.The incredible incident helped Stokes, who was born in New Zealand, hit 14 off the over to tie the game and send it to a super over, from which England emerged victorious in front of a jubilant home crowd.Scroll down for video. Ben Stokes was scampering for a second run in the final over of the Cricket World CupMartin Guptill's attempt to run him out backfired when the ball hit the Englishman's batIt then ricocheted away from New Zealand wicketkeeper Tom Latham and towards the ropeSpeaking after the game, Stokes said: 'Playing against New Zealand is always a great event to be a part of. They’re a seriously good team and they’re great lads. 'I said to (Captain) Kane (Williamson) I’ll be apologising for that for the rest of my life!'The 28-year-old all-rounder was nominated as one of England's three batsmen in the super over and contributed eight of his team's 15 runs - a target which New Zealand fell agonisingly short of as they matched the total but lost the game by virtue of hitting fewer boundaries throughout the game.Stokes lay prone on the floor as the ball ran away and down towards the boundary New Zealand's Colin de Grandhomme gave chase but couldn't catch up to the ballEngland were awarded six runs after the ball went for four - they had also run two Stokes can't believe the scenes as England tie the World Cup final against New ZealandEngland needed 15 runs off the final over at Lord's to win the World Cup. Ben Stokes and spinner Adil Rashid were at the crease.1st ball:  Trent Boult bowls a superb yorker that Stokes struggles to get away properly. He manages to get the ball off the square but not much further and there's no run. 2nd ball: The same story as Stokes tries and fails to heave the ball into the crowd. Instead, he digs down on another yorker and squirts it to extra cover. 3rd ball: An almighty six. Stokes moves outside off and slog-sweeps it into an ecstatic Lord's crowd. Nine are now required.4th ball: This is where the drama really unfolds. Stokes tries to launch a full toss but finds Guptill, whose attempt to run out England's dangerman goes horribly wrong as the ball hits his bat and runs away to the boundary.5th ball: Another yorker, Stokes has no choice but to run for two. Rashid is run out but a precious run is in the bag and he crucially retains the strike. Two runs required. 6th ball: Pandemonium at Lord's as England attempt two for the win but it ends with another run out. This time it's Wood who is out and the game is going to a super over.He won the man of the match award for his contribution with the ball and his 84 from 98 balls - plus his heroics in the extra over.Stokes added: 'I’m pretty lost for words. All that hard work over four years to get here and be champions of the world, it’s an amazing feeling. I’m pretty done to be honest.'England required 15 off the final over chasing 242 to win the final have lost at the same stage on three separate occasions. The 28 year-old looked stunned after his heroics helped England to their first World Cup winHe held his hands up to apologise to the New Zealand team for the one-off accident There is nothing in the laws of the game that say runs should not be awarded if a ball hits a batsman and goes into the outfield.However it is deemed contrary to the 'spirit of the game' to profiteer off such a slice of luck and typically batsmen will not attempt a run if the ball hits them when a fielder has attempted a run out.However on this occasion, because the ball went to the boundary, four runs were added to the total.Stokes cut a frustrated figure when he failed to score off the first two balls, but a beautiful strike over mid-wicket for six got the crowd on their feet. It was then that the game became even more chaotic. The Christchurch-born star smeared a full toss into the deep and set off for two. Opener Guptill tried to fire the ball at the stumps of the end Stokes was running at - but the England man's dive for desperation turned to joy as the ball hit his bat and deflected to the boundary.  In the spirit of the game Stokes was unlikely to have run from the deflection, however because the ball went all the way to the boundary umpire Kumar Dharmasena had no choice but to signal for a four to add to the two runs scampered by Stokes and Adil Rashid.After two more runs and two more wickets England were all out for 241, the same score managed by New Zealand earlier on in the day. That helped set up the dramatic finale that left the Lord's crowd in disbelief and England celebrating their first ever World Cup win.  England won their first World Cup after making it to the final on three previous occasions ",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/cricket/article-7246645/Ben-Stokes-jokes-incredible-moment-helped-England-World-Cup-glory.html?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

However, as the name implies, these posts won’t be fully removed from Twitter, just hidden from the default view — everyone will still be able to tap on a gray icon to view hidden replies.Here’s how Twitter’s Michelle Yasmeen Haq and Brittany Forks explain the feature:Everyday, people start important conversations on Twitter, from #MeToo and #BlackLivesMatter, to discussions around #NBAFinals or their favorite television shows. These conversations bring people together to debate, learn, and laugh. That said we know that distracting, irrelevant, and offensive replies can derail the discussions that people want to have. We believe people should have some control over the conversations they start.As my colleague Sarah Perez noted previously, the current implementation is open to at least two criticisms — one, that it could allow users to hide critical viewpoints or fact-checking of their tweets (maybe quote-tweeting will be the better strategy moving forward), and two, that it still forces people to wade through potentially trollish or hateful content in order to hide replies.Haq and Forks emphasize that Twitter is still looking for ways to improve the feature: “By testing in one country we want to get feedback and better understand how this tool can improve before it’s available globally.”And yes, the timing of the news is a little awkward, coming right after Twitter went down for about an hour.Jack Dorsey says it’s time to rethink the fundamental dynamics of Twitter",https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/11/twitter-will-start-testing-its-hide-replies-feature-next-week-in-canada/?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

The India Meteorological Department has predicted more rainfall in the state for the next 24 hours.",The New Indian Express,"GUWAHATI: The flood fury in Assam has continued as the deluge claimed four more human lives on Sunday and affected over 26 lakh people in 28 of the state’s 33 districts so far.

The deaths were reported from Jorhat, Dhubri and Barpeta districts. With these, the death toll has risen to 11 in flood and landslides, triggered by incessant rains.

According to official sources, 26,45,533 people in 3,181 villages and localities under 103 revenue circles in 28 districts have been affected. The number of animals affected was 10,42,346 while cropland affected was in areas of 87,607 hectares.

The Brahmaputra and a number of its tributaries were in a spate, flowing above danger level at various places including Guwahati. The authorities have set up 327 relief camps where 16,596 of the marooned were taking shelter.

The Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) has predicted rains in the state in the next 24 hours. 

“According to forecast by IMD, there will be rains in Assam in the next 24 hours. As this is the first wave of the flood this year, the damage could be more,” Additional Chief Secretary Kumar Sanjay Krishna told journalists on Sunday. 

He said Dhemaji, Lakhimpur and Barpeta were the worst-hit districts. Some flood-affected people alleged that they were not getting relief materials. The bureaucrat, however, claimed that the relief materials were being distributed to all the affected people.

The flood submerged all national parks and wildlife sanctuaries in the state. In the one-horned rhino-famed Kaziranga National Park, the animals were fleeing to nearby hills to save their lives.

“The flood has submerged nearly 90 per cent of Kaziranga National Park. The animals have moved towards the Karbi Anglong hills. Except for a few, most of the rhinos were taking shelter on the highlands within the park,” the park’s director P Sivakumar told this newspaper.

The park authorities introduced “time cards” for vehicles from Sunday, fixing the highest speed limit at 40 km per hour. Some deer were run over by speeding vehicles on a national highway that runs beside the World Heritage site.

Meanwhile, the Assam State Commission for Protection of Child Rights expressed concern over children, adolescents, pregnant and lactating mothers facing the wrath of the flood.

“We have written to the authorities to provide adequate baby food, sanitary napkin, safe drinking water, medical kits and facilities and adequate number of toilets with water facility. Above all, no child should fall prey to the hands of traffickers,” the commission said. ",http://www.newindianexpress.com/nation/2019/jul/14/assam-flood-fury-continues-four-more-perish-over-26-lakh-affected-2003814.html?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

US President Donald Trump's administration has said it is open to negotiations with Iran.",Reuters,"DUBAI/PARIS (Reuters) - Iran is ready to hold talks with the United States if Washington lifts sanctions and returns to the 2015 nuclear deal it quit last year, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani said in a televised speech on Sunday. U.S. President Donald Trump’s administration has said it is open to negotiations with Iran on a more far-reaching agreement on nuclear and security issues.  But Iran has made any talks conditional on first being able to export as much oil as it did before the United States withdrew from the nuclear pact with world powers in May 2018. “We have always believed in talks ... if they lift sanctions, end the imposed economic pressure and return to the deal, we are ready to hold talks with America today, right now and anywhere,” Rouhani said in his Sunday speech.  In an interview with the Washington Post newspaper, Pompeo dismissed Rouhani’s idea as “the same offer that he offered to John F. Kerry and Barack Obama,” referring to the former U.S. secretary of state and president. “President Trump will obviously make the final decision. But this is a path that the previous administration had gone down and it led to the (Iran nuclear deal) which this administration, President Trump and I both believe was a disaster,” Pompeo said. Confrontations between Washington and Tehran have escalated, culminating in an aborted plan for U.S. air strikes on Iran last month after Tehran downed a U.S. drone. Trump called off the retaliatory U.S. air strike at the last minute. Calling for dialogue among all to resume, France, Britain and Germany - parties to the 2015 pact - said on Sunday they were preoccupied by the escalation of tensions in the Gulf region and the risk the nuclear deal might fall apart.      “We believe that the time has come to act responsibly and to look for ways to stop the escalation of tension and resume dialogue,” they said in a joint statement that was released by the French president’s office.  Despite calling for talks with Iranian leaders, Trump said on Wednesday that U.S. sanctions on Iran would soon be increased “substantially”. Existing U.S. sanctions have targeted Iran’s main foreign revenue stream from crude oil exports, which Trump in May moved to try to eliminate entirely.  In reaction, Tehran said it would scale back its commitments under the deal, under which it had agreed to curb its nuclear program in return for relief from U.S. and other economic sanctions that had crippled its economy. Defying a warning by the European parties to the pact to continue its full compliance, Tehran has amassed more low-enriched uranium than permitted and has started to enrich uranium above the 3.67% permitted by the agreement.  “The risks are such that it is necessary for all stakeholders to pause, and consider the possible consequences of their actions,” France, Britain and Germany, which have been trying to salvage the pact by shielding Tehran’s economy from sanctions, said in their statement. Iranian clerical rulers have said that Tehran will further decrease its commitments if Europeans fail to fulfill their promises to guarantee Iran’s interests under the deal. The nuclear deal aimed to extend the amount of time it would theoretically take Iran to produce enough fissile material for an atomic bomb - so-called breakout time - from several months to a minimum of one year until 2025.  Iran denies ever having considered developing atomic weapons. There have been two signs in the past week that the United States may be signaling greater openness to diplomacy. U.S. officials told Reuters on Thursday that Washington had decided for now not to sanction Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif despite Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin’s June 24 statement he would be blacklisted that week. On Sunday, U.S. officials said they had given Zarif a U.S. visa to attend a U.N. meeting this week. Iran’s mission to the United Nations said he had arrived in New York. Pompeo told the Washington Post he had granted the visa but restricted Zarif’s movements while in New York, allowing him only to travel between U.N. headquarters and the Iranian mission six blocks away, and to the residence of Iran’s U.N. ambassador. Pompeo declined comment when asked whether he or other U.S. officials would try to speak with Zarif this week or at the U.N. General Assembly in September, the Washington Post reported. While accusing Zarif of exploiting U.S. freedom of the press to “spread malign propaganda,” the U.S. secretary of state told the newspaper he would accept any offer to appear on Iranian television.

572,India says Deloitte misreading law against call for 5-yr ban: Report,"The government reportedly told a tribunal that Deloitte was misreading law by arguing that the case against it should be dismissed as its term at IL&FS unit IFIN had ended when the fraud was alleged. ""Fraud continuing till date on account of errant past auditor...can be covered under law,"" it added. India is seeking a 5-year ban on Deloitte India.",Reuters,"NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India has told a tribunal the local auditing affiliate of international accounting group Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu is misreading a key federal law as the firm seeks to avoid a five-year ban on new business, according to legal documents reviewed by Reuters on Sunday. Deloitte Haskins & Sells LLP is contesting the government’s call for the ban on the auditor for its alleged involvement in a financial fraud. The government has said it detected several violations of auditing standards by Deloitte and a KPMG affiliate while investigating fraud at IFIN, a unit of Infrastructure Leasing & Financial Services, whose debt defaults last year triggered fears of a financial contagion. Both auditors deny wrongdoing. Deloitte’s filing showed it last month argued the government case should be dismissed because it came after the auditor’s 10-year stint at IFIN ended. The last audit it did was for the fiscal year to March 2018. The alleged fraud began to be exposed last autumn and Deloitte said the law only allowed such a ban to be imposed if the auditor was actively auditing the company at the time, and didn’t allow the government to take into account the firm’s work over previous years. India’s Ministry of Corporate Affairs has countered, saying the law can’t be read in such a “narrow and pedantic manner”, according to its June 28 tribunal filing, which has been reviewed by Reuters and is not public.  “A fraud that continues till date on account of errant past auditor ... can undoubtedly be covered” under Indian law provisions, the government said in its 13-page filing, adding Deloitte was misreading and incorrectly interpreting the law. The law was intended to “weed out an errant auditor from practicing so that corporate democracy, transparency and the economy of the country is not destabilizing”, it added. The case will next be heard on Monday at the National Company Law Tribunal in Mumbai.  A spokesman for Deloitte told Reuters on Sunday it had been advised the government’s case was “not maintainable”, declining to comment further. It has previously said “it has been thorough and diligent” in its duties as an auditor.  India detected auditing failures as part of its wide-ranging probe into alleged fraud and mismanagement at IFIN, which has also been investigated by several other agencies including the Serious Fraud Investigation Office and the central bank. The auditing firms gave clean audit reports and “miserably failed to fulfill the duty entrusted to them,” the government has alleged, saying the fraud at IFIN was “nothing short of organized crime, actively aided and abetted by the statutory auditors”. In its filing, the government also said that if Deloitte’s interpretation of law was to be accepted, it would mean any auditor who commits fraud, but resigns before legal proceedings are initiated against it, can’t be banned in the country. The KPMG affiliate accused in the case, BSR & Associates, has also denied the allegations and said it performed IFIN’s audit in accordance with the applicable auditing standards and legal framework. BSR audited IFIN alongside Deloitte in the year to March 2018, and then was the sole auditor for the 2018-19 year. It resigned days after the government filed the tribunal case last month. Whichever way the Indian tribunal rules, the government’s allegations have already cast a shadow on local operations of big foreign auditors, who audit many of the foreign companies in India, as well as large domestic firms. “We are already seeing evidence of some of our global clients being spooked by this and the extent of the punishment being sought,” said a senior partner with a global audit firm.

573,Gangwal limited his financial risk: IndiGo Co-Founder Bhatia,"IndiGo Co-Founder Rahul Bhatia has said that while he had extended personal loans to finance IndiGo from fiscal 2006-10, Co-Founder Rakesh Gangwal remained in ""safe harbour"" with equity exposure below ₹15 crore. He added that his IGE Group and Gangwal had a financial risk ratio of 80:1. Gangwal attempted to de-risk himself and pushed for IndiGo's sale, Bhatia further alleged.",The Financial Express,"Asserting that the arrangement between the promoter groups has been transparent from inception at IndiGo, Rahul Bhatia group Sunday claimed that Rakesh Gangwal always limited his financial risks and was making insidious efforts to create an unseemly controversy about corporate governance. In a reflection of the deep differences between the two promoter groups, InterGlobe Enterprises (IGE) Group has now issued three statements in less than a week seeking to clarify issues and reject the allegations by Gangwal.Gangwal has sought markets watchdog Sebi’s intervention to address the corporate governance issues at InterGlobe Aviation — the parent of the country’s largest carrier IndiGo — where he holds around 37 per cent stake while Bhatia group has about 38 per cent shareholding.Also read: Sterlite Technologies ropes in lobbyist in US for advocating its cause on trade issues“Even more significantly, during the turbulent period of a fledgling airline, it was left to the IGE Group, as a responsible founder, to fend for IndiGo. Gangwal was missing in action at that time and there were stages where he wanted to de-risk and pushed for the business to be sold,” the group said in a statement that also provided details about investments made by the two sides. Noting that Gangwal has much to answer, the group wondered whether there is sanctity in agreements entered into by business people – freely and at their own will.“Do business ethics and morals permit a contracting party to walk away from its obligations at its convenience after it has enjoyed the benefits under an agreement and pretend to be a victim?,” it said. Referring to purchase of planes from Airbus, the statement said that the IGE Group and Gangwal gave a joint undertaking of support IndiGo in November 2005, wherein both sides undertook to invest in the airline at least USD 50 million (which then was about Rs 200 crore), and maintain that investment until the delivery of the last aircraft.“As Gangwal was not going to take any further financial risk or obligation, IGE singly (though the undertaking to Airbus was a joint one ) took the obligation to further invest up to Rs 110 crore in IndiGo so that taken together with the then existing investment of Rs 99 crore, the conditions placed by Airbus could be met,” the group claimed. According to the statement, IGE Group continued to support the startup (IndiGo) without diluting Gangwal’s potential upside.“Kapil Bhatia and Rahul Bhatia extended personal loans to IndiGo and personal guarantees to the banks for diverse financing needs of IndiGo such as pre-delivery payments, aircraft acquisition, and working capital requirements. “Starting from financial year 2005-06 at a level of Rs 143 crore of personal guarantees by financial year 2009-10, the aggregate financial exposure of IGE, Kapil Bhatia and Rahul Bhatia was well over Rs 1,100 crore… while Gangwal was in safe harbour with equity exposure of less than Rs 15 crore,” it noted. Further, the group said that there was a “risk ratio of almost 80:1 as between the IGE Group and Gangwal”.Personal guarantees of Kapil Bhatia and Rahul Bhatia continued to be in force until end of financial year 2012 and by that time IndiGo — which Gangwal equates to a ‘paan ki dukaan’ (betel shop) — had an adequate balance sheet to support itself, the statement claimed.Kapil Bhatia is the father of Rahul Bhatia. Gangwal has raised concerns about shareholders’ agreement that provides more powers to Bhatia group and about various related party transactions. “The rights and obligations as shareholders of IndiGo were enshrined in the shareholders agreement to reflect their agreement and understandings in relation to the governance, management and operation of IndiGo… the deal was struck between seasoned business people who made their own assessment of risks, their rights, and their obligations,” the statement said.Get live Stock Prices from BSE and NSE and latest NAV, portfolio of Mutual Funds, calculate your tax by Income Tax Calculator, know market’s Top Gainers, Top Losers & Best Equity Funds.

574,"No 'Greta effect' on Lufthansa's passenger numbers, says CEO","Lufthansa expects the number of its passengers to rise four per cent this year, not seeing any ""Greta effect"" on booking levels, the German airline's CEO Carsten Spohr said. This follows activists led by 16-year-old Swedish activist Greta Thunberg boycotting air travel amid carbon emission concerns. ""Climate change discussions aren't causing restraint with bookings. People want to fly,"" he said.",Reuters,"ZURICH (Reuters) - German airline Lufthansa (LHAG.DE) expects passenger numbers to rise about 4% this year, its chief executive told a newspaper, playing down talk that public support for teenage climate activist Greta Thunberg might be curbing air travel.  “At this time we don’t see restraint - in fact, the opposite,” Carsten Spohr told the NZZ am Sonntag newspaper in the interview published on Sunday.  “In comparison to last year, already a record year, we’re expecting passenger growth of about 4 percent, (Lufthansa unit) Swiss International Air Lines is also showing growth. The discussion of climate change is not leading to restraint with bookings. People want to fly.” Media reports have suggested a “Greta effect” might curb demand for air travel, referring to the 16-year-old who has gained global attention for her efforts to convince people to reduce carbon-emitting activities. On Saturday, a group of about 80 protesters staged a “Flight Strike” at Zurich Airport near the facilities of Swiss International Air Lines, singing songs, handing out leaflets, and encouraging people to pledge not to fly in 2020.  There were no arrests, and the demonstration dispersed without police intervention. Spohr cited figures from the International Energy Agency showing air travel produces 2.8% of human-caused carbon dioxide.  He is frustrated that airlines are on the defensive over their contribution to climate-changing emissions. “We haven’t succeeded in explaining that air travel influences the world positively: We connect countries, economies and societies together,” Spohr, a trained pilot, told the newspaper. “Moreover, for years we’ve been able to reduce our per-passenger CO2 emissions.” Spohr said flights offered by discount or budget airlines for just a few dollars were hurting the sector’s image. “They’re making our industry the target of criticism and clogging up the airspace, because an artificial demand is being stimulated that wouldn’t exist if there were realistic prices,” he said.  “There should not be flights under 10 euros.” He defended Lufthansa unit Eurowings offering flights for under 35 euros, citing the need to defend its home market. Friends of the Earth estimates aviation emissions more than doubled between 1990 and 2016, while overall emissions fell by 43%. In Europe, low aviation taxes, a proliferation of budget airlines like easyJet (EZJ.L) and Ryanair (RYA.I) and the rise of Airbnb have spurred an air-travel boom. Nations including the Netherlands and France are seeking to convince fellow European countries to end tax exemptions on jet fuel and plane tickets.

590,Internship at White House worst career advice I've received: Lewinsky,"American television personality Monica Lewinsky today tweeted that ""an internship at the White House will be amazing on your resume"" is the worst career advice she's ever received. Over 20 years ago, former US President Bill Clinton and Lewinsky, a White House intern, were named in a sex scandal. Clinton was impeached by the House for lying about the affair.",Daily Mail,"Monica Lewinsky continues to show a sense of humor about her affair with her former boss Bill Clinton, two decades after the president was impeached by the House for lying about their relationship.As is usually the case, Lewinsky found a way to joke about her Oval Office rendezvouses on social media as she responded to a tweet posted bt organizational psychologist and fellow Ted-talker Adam Grant.'What’s the worst career advice you’ve ever received?' Grant asked his followers.  More than 700 people responded to the tweet in the 24 hours after it was posted, but Lewinsky provided what was by far the most amusing, and specific, response to that question.'An internship at the White House will look amazing on your resume,' wrote Lewinsky.She then added an emoji of a blushing face. Scroll down for videoI'm with her: Monica Lewinsky (above with Bill Clinton in the Oval Office after he delivered his weekly radio address in 1997)  responded to a tweet asking people on the social media platform to share the worst career advice they had ever receivedOh-well office: Lewinsky's internship resulted in her being hired as an aide at the White House Office of Legislative Affairs in December 1995 (tweet above)Thousands of people retweeted and liked Lewinsky's tweet, while many of the comments noted how incredible it is that she maintains her sense of humor about the affair.The Clintons do not feel the same, and have continued to publicly dismiss Lewinsky on the few occasions when they are asked about the relationship.In June of last year, Clinton was asked by Craig Melvin if he ever apologized to Lewinsky, and if he felt that he needed to apologize to the former staff member he engaged in sex acts with at their place of employment. 'No, I do—I do not. I’ve never talked to her,' said Clinton.'But I did say, publicly, on more than one occasion, that I was sorry. That’s very different. The apology was public.'Hillary is similarly not with her, and said it was 'absolutely not' an abuse of power when the leader of the free world began having a affair with an aide on CBS Sunday Morning last year. She then explained that the reason it was not an abuse of power was because Lewinsky 'was an adult.' Despite that open contempt, Lewinsky has said that she wishes she could offer both Hillary and her daughter Chelsea an apology in person. Lewinsky has become increasingly comfortable discussing the affair in the past few years, and in the wake of the #MeToo movement many have identified the dynamic between herself and Clinton as a clear abuse of power.At the same time, she has also turned the personal hell she was forced to endure when news of the affair was leaked into a anti-bullying rally cry.Tears of a clown: Clinton was later impeached by the House for lying about the affair (above in 1999 after the Senate voted not to impeach), and both he and his wife Hillary have made no secret of their contempt for LewinskyThat pathos was on display back in December, when Lewinsky spoke at the annual Women in Entertainment breakfast in Los Angeles.The focus of that speech was the fact that every single person will make a mistake at some point in their career.She joked early on that her most notable mistake was probably a bit more serious than every single other person in the room, a line that drew laughter from those in attendance.Lewinsky also had some fun introducing herself to the young woman in the mentorship program that the annual event benefits, finding a way to introduce herself to the future female leaders who were born after her Oval Office liaisons were front page news. 'Some of you — if you know the music of Eminem, Kid Cudi, G-Eazy and, of course, Beyonce — may have probably heard of me in a couple of their songs,' noted Lewinsky.Prior to that she gave a more concise overview, summarizing her fame by stating: 'I am a former beret model who is also a lyric in songs.'  Turning serious, the former intern-turned-White-House-aide then explained to the young women that every person in the room has 'made a mistake in our career that has come with consequence.'She continued: 'Like breathing and change, mistakes are a guaranteed part of life. They can be found in the history of every successful person, and they are often the seed of every downfall.'Lewinsky then added however that mistakes 'can be rich with learning and growth, even when they are painful and devastating.'As an example, Lewinsky shared a story about her time testifying in front of a grand jury.'At the conclusion of my second or third time there, the foreperson of the grand jury, who was actually a stranger to me, said: ""Monica, none of us in this room is perfect, we all fall and we fall several times a day. The only difference between your age and my age, is now, I get up faster,""' said Lewinsky.'I have now lived long enough to know that she was 100 percent right.'In closing out, Lewinsky also quoted a line from comedian Hannah Gadsby, saying: 'There is nothing more powerful than a broken woman who has rebuilt herself.'That is exactly how Lewinsky was described that day when introduced at the event by Lena Dunham. 'Let's give a hand for a woman who rises again and again, who refuses to allow labels and preconceptions to prevent her from using her big beautiful voice,' said Dunham. ",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-7245935/Monica-Lewinsky-jokes-bad-career-advice-20-years-Bill-Clinton-impeached-affair.html?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

""Don't impose any language, but don't oppose any language too,"" Naidu said.",ANI,"Mysuru (Karnataka) [India], Jul 14 (ANI): Vice President M Venkiah Naidu has stressed that there should be no imposition to any language while maintaining that there must also not be opposition to any.Inaugurating the golden jubilee celebrations of the Central Institute of Indian Languages (CIIL) here on Saturday, the Vice President said, ""Language should become a catalyst for inclusive development.""He added that the promotion of one language was not tantamount to undermining or opposing other languages.""Languages must unite us in the cause for inclusive and sustainable development and must not end up as tools to divide us. There should be no imposition of any language nor should there be opposition to any language,"" the Vice President noted.Calling for a multi-pronged approach to preserve and develop Indian languages, Naidu said that it was time to rethink and reinvent the entire language education in our country.""We must start by making the mother tongue the medium of instruction in schools at least at the primary level or up to 8th grade,"" he suggested.The Vice President also advised every state government to make the medium of instruction in mother tongue mandatory up to 5th or 8th grade.

599,I-T Dept snooping people's social media a misconception: CBDT,"The notion that Income Tax Department snoops people's spending patterns on social media platforms to find tax evaders is a ""misconception"", Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) Chairman PC Mody said. ""We already get to know actual...financial transactions of people from authentic sources,"" he said. However, he said CBDT has deployed a data analytics system to profile entities' transaction trail.",Times Now,"New Delhi: It is a ""misconception"" to think that the Income Tax Department is snooping on social media posts related to exotic foreign tours or possession of expensive goods to check undisclosed income, a top official has said. CBDT Chairman P C Mody told PTI during an interview that the tax department does not need to undertake such measures as it is empowered to obtain various information and data sets from multiple agencies and possesses a strong data analytics setup to work out the source and destination of high-value transactions.He was asked if the taxman or the I-T Department scans Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and other social media handles of people to obtain secret information about their income and spending behaviour as reported in the past in multiple media reports.It has been reported that the taxman will keep a secret eye on social media posts to find out who is undertaking an expensive foreign trip or is flaunting their expensive vehicle or other goods over these platforms, in order to ensure such people or entities pay their due taxes. ""That is a misconception. Why do we need to go on (social media platforms)?,"" the CBDT boss told the news agency.""We already get to know actual travel details or other financial transactions of a person from authentic sources,"" he said. The CBDT is the policy-making body for the I-T department. He added that the Board has deployed an advanced data analytics system that mines and churns a lot of figures and data to understand which sectors should be taxed and where can relief be extended.The tax department has named this new system as 'Project Insight', as it provides a 360-degree profiling and insight into an entities' complete transactions trail. Mody said the department, backed by these systems, is now working to start an SMS-based service where a person will be intimated about at least 18 different types of transactions they have undertaken above a certain threshold of money.""This is to promote a non-adversarial regime between the taxman and the taxpayer. We just inform the person that we know that you have undertaken such and such transactions and hence you should mention these while filing your income tax returns (ITRs) and also pay taxes, if applicable,"" he said. ""We have just launched the pre-filled ITRs for certain class of taxpayers. It is aimed to ease tax compliance for taxpayers.""""We are working to make things hassle-free and work like an accountant for the taxpayer by keeping a record and presenting an automated account of their transactions,"" he said. The department obtains these details from third-party agencies like banks, mutual funds, credit card companies, sub-registrar and it is advised that taxpayers should re-check this information before submitting the return as there could be chances that some discrepancies creep in while furnishing of this data, he said.In the recent budget, the government has made ITR filing mandatory for high spenders even if their taxable income is below the threshold exemption limit of Rs 5 lakh. Those mandated to file returns include people spending more than Rs 2 lakh on a foreign trip or depositing Rs 1 crore in a year in a bank account or paying the electricity bill of more than Rs 1 lakh in a year.The CBDT chief said these measures were brought in after data analytics found high spenders were probably not filing their returns. ""If someone is spending this much, should not their income be taxable? One should see the entire ecosystem around this...,"" he said. The aim is to create a tax compliant society where the honest taxpayer is honoured and respected and the tax evader faces the law, he said.Mody said it is with this aim that the government and the CBDT have decided to usher in the regime of anonymised assessment where the taxpayer and the assessing officer will not meet each other and the entire tax proceeding would be conducted online. ""That infrastructure for faceless assessment is already provided for. It may need some sort of an augmentation which will definitely be done,"" he said.",https://www.timesnownews.com/business-economy/article/misconception-to-think-taxman-snoops-on-social-media-posts-cbdt/453698?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

England, on the other hand, thrashed Australia by 8 wickets in the semi-final to make their first final in 27 years.The Three Lions got to bat second in the title clash, just as they did in all their previous three outings in 1979, 1987 and 1992.

Not the content of the video, but the green t-shirt worn by Chakrabarti triggered a controversy leading to resurfacing of the video almost eight months later.What led to the uproar is that by some Bose is perceived as ""an Indian nationalist who collaborated with the Nazis"", as pointed out in a report by Jewish Telegraphic Agency. The report further describes Bose as a dissenting Indian nationalist who enlisted ""tens of thousands of Indian men to support the Japanese Invasion of British India in 1944 and help fight the British in Europe for Hitler.""Similar views were echoed in a report by Newsweek headlined, ""Who was Subhas Chandra Bose?

626,J&J faces probe on denial of carcinogen in baby talc: Report,"The US Justice Department is now reportedly pursuing a criminal investigation into whether Johnson & Johnson (J&J) lied to public about cancer risks related to its 'Baby Powder'. Reports said a grand jury was examining documents about what J&J knew regarding any carcinogens in its products. A J&J spokesperson denied the new development, adding, ""[It] doesn't contain asbestos...or cause cancer.""",Livemint,"The US Justice Department is pursuing a criminal investigation into whether Johnson & Johnson lied to the public about the possible cancer risks of its talcum powder, people with knowledge of the matter said.The criminal probe, which hasn’t been reported previously, coincides with a regulatory investigation and civil claims by thousands of cancer patients that J&J’s Baby Powder talc was responsible for their illness. Now, a grand jury in Washington is examining documents related to what company officials knew about any carcinogens in their products, the people said.Baby Powder accounts for only a tiny fraction of J&J’s annual revenue, but it’s been a core brand for the company for more than a century. Questions about the product’s safety have led to more than 14,000 lawsuits from consumers asserting that the company’s talc products caused their ovarian cancer or mesothelioma, a rare form of the disease linked to asbestos exposure.J&J disclosed in February that it had received subpoenas, but little was known then about the investigation behind them, including whether the matter was civil or criminal. The filing didn’t mention a grand jury.The company said in a statement Friday that there had been no new developments. “We have been fully cooperating with the previously disclosed DOJ investigation and will continue to do so,"" said J&J spokeswoman Kim Montagnino. “Johnson’s Baby Powder does not contain asbestos or cause cancer, as supported by decades of independent clinical evidence.""The Justice Department didn’t respond to requests for comment.Shares of J&J declined by 4.2% to close at $134.30.J&J, the world’s largest maker of health care products, has said safety tests of its Baby Powder over many decades have shown no presence of asbestos. But some of the lawsuits have turned up internal memos as far back as the 1960s and ’70s that contain warnings from company scientists that asbestos detected in J&J’s talc was a “severe health hazard"" that could pose a legal risk for the company.Justice Department prosecutors, FBI agents and Securities and Exchange Commission regulators are almost surely looking at whether J&J officials’ public denials that their talc-based products ever contained asbestos were truthful, legal experts said. SEC spokeswoman Judy Burns declined to comment.Nearly a dozen juries have concluded J&J knew that some of their Baby Powder and former Shower-to-Shower products had at least trace amounts of asbestos and failed to disclose that to consumers. Over the past three years, jurors have awarded a total of more than $5 billion to people who blame the powders for their cancers.The company has said it has set aside money for legal costs related to talc claims but hasn’t said how much. Bloomberg Intelligence estimates that civil settlements could cost J&J as much as $15 billion overall. J&J says it has no liability because the products are safe.Shares of J&J plunged as much as 17% in December -- erasing billions in value -- after news reports about memos appearing to show that J&J executives knew the products were contaminated with asbestos as early as the 1970s.The February document requests from the Justice Department, the SEC and the top Democrat on the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions sought information about the company’s knowledge of asbestos in its talc-based products. J&J said it would be “cooperating with these government inquiries and will be producing documents in response.""The grand jury was impaneled after the Justice Department’s fraud unit started an investigation. Investigators are probably looking for more internal communications that might conflict with the company’s public statements, said Henry Klingeman, a former federal prosecutor now in private practice in New Jersey.“Since J&J is a public company, they are probably looking at whether their statements amounted to fraudulent statements to consumers and regulators,"" Klingeman said in an interview. “I’d also think they’d be looking at whether they violated securities-fraud laws.""The grand jury inquiry is likely to influence any talks between J&J and plaintiffs over resolving their claims out of court, said Peter Henning, a law professor at Wayne State University in Detroit.“This will make it more difficult for Johnson & Johnson to settle the civil cases as long as there is a continuing criminal investigation, which may require employees to testify before a federal grand jury,"" Henning said. “Civil plaintiffs may not want to settle until they know better whether criminal charges will be filed, which they can use to aid their cases.""In addition to the consumers’ suits, some J&J investors have accused the company of defrauding them, arguing in lawsuits that J&J failed to disclose that its powder was tainted and that the company’s shares were artificially inflated as a result.Jacob Frenkel, a former SEC trial lawyer now in private practice in Washington, said there’s no timeline for grand-jury investigations and no certainty it will result in charges. “This could be a high-profile government investigation that goes nowhere,"" he said. “Regardless of the outcome, the timetable for such investigations can measure in years, not months,"" he added.Baby powder is mostly talc, a mineral used to keep skin dry and as an astringent to prevent diaper rash. It’s also used in consumer products such as makeup, paint and dietary supplements. But geological formations that contain talc also yield asbestos, a mineral once used in products such as building insulation.Scientists have found strong links between asbestos and mesothelioma, while plaintiffs’ lawyers claim that studies have also shown a link between talc and ovarian cancer. In court filings, J&J has disputed both contentions.J&J sold the rights to its Shower-to-Shower talcum powder to Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc. in 2012. Valeant, which changed its name to Bausch Health Cos last year, has an indemnity agreement with J&J covering asbestos suits tied to the powder.Juries in states such as Missouri, California and New Jersey have ruled for some of the plaintiffs since suits started going to trial in 2016. However, some of those verdicts have been thrown out by judges and others are on appeal. Some other cases have resulted in hung juries or outright wins for J&J.Most of the ovarian cancer cases, along with investors’ suits, have been consolidated before a federal judge in New Jersey for pretrial information exchanges and test trials. The first trials of those cases haven’t yet been set.This story has been published from a wire agency feed without modifications to the text. only the headline has been changed",https://www.livemint.com/companies/news/j-j-denials-of-asbestos-in-baby-powder-spur-criminal-probe-1563026592158.html?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts
