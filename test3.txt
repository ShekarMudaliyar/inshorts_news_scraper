US Navy shoots down Iranian drone in Strait of Hormuz
US President Donald Trump on Thursday said that a US Navy ship had "destroyed" an Iranian drone in the Strait of Hormuz after the aircraft threatened the vessel. He added that the drone had flown to within 1,000 yards of the ship and had ignored "multiple calls to stand down". Iran in June shot down a US military surveillance drone.

Reuters
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States said on Thursday that a U.S. Navy ship had “destroyed” an Iranian drone in the Strait of Hormuz after the aircraft threatened the vessel, but Iran said it had no information about losing a drone.     
In the latest episode to stir tensions in the Gulf, U.S. President Donald Trump told an event at the White House that the drone had flown to within 1,000 yards (meters) of the USS Boxer and had ignored “multiple calls to stand down.” 
“This is the latest of many provocative and hostile actions by Iran against vessels operating in international waters. The United States reserves the right to defend our personnel, facilities and interests,” Trump said.     
“The drone was immediately destroyed,” he added. 
Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif told reporters at the United Nations: “We have no information about losing a drone today.” 
The Pentagon said in a statement that the USS Boxer, an amphibious assault ship, had taken “defensive action” against a drone on Thursday morning as the Boxer was moving into the Strait of Hormuz.  
“We do assess it was an Iranian drone,” said Commander Rebecca Rebarich, a Pentagon spokeswoman.   
Tensions in the Gulf region are high, with fears that the United States and Iran could stumble into war. 
The United States has blamed Iran for a series of attacks since mid-May on shipping around the Strait of Hormuz, the world’s most important oil artery. Tehran rejects the allegations. 
Iran in June shot down a U.S. military surveillance drone in the Gulf with a surface-to-air missile. Iran says the drone was in its airspace, but Washington says it was in international skies. 
Trump said at the time the United States had come close to launching a military strike on Iran in retaliation for the downing of the U.S. drone.    
The increased use of drones by Iran and its allies for surveillance and attacks across the Middle East is raising alarms in Washington.  
The United States believes that Iran-linked militia in Iraq have recently increased their surveillance of American troops and bases in the country by using off-the-shelf, commercially available drones, U.S. officials say. 
A U.S. official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the drone on Thursday was brought down through electronic jamming.  
Tension in the Strait of Hormuz: tmsnrt.rs/32tzK6J 
Relations between the United States and Iran have worsened since last year when Trump abandoned a 2015 deal between world powers and Iran in which Tehran agreed to restrict nuclear work in return for the lifting of sanctions.     
The United States has reimposed sanctions to throttle Iran’s oil trade and says it wants to increase pressure on Tehran to renegotiate the accord, discuss its ballistic missile program and modify its behavior in the Middle East, where Washington is allied to several Arab states opposed to Iran. 
Iran’s clerical rulers have ruled out renegotiating the nuclear deal or holding talks on its missile program, which it says is purely defensive.  
But Zarif told reporters on Thursday that Iran had offered to make a concession on its nuclear program - to ratify a document prescribing more intrusive inspections - if the United States abandoned its economic sanctions - a proposal that drew U.S. skepticism. 
“If Iran wants to make a serious gesture, it should start by ending uranium enrichment immediately,” a U.S. senior administration official said, adding any talks should include “a permanent end to Iran’s malign nuclear ambitions, including its development of nuclear-capable missiles.”  
Earlier on Thursday, the United States demanded Iran immediately release a vessel it seized in the Gulf, and a U.S. military commander in the region said the United States would work “aggressively” to ensure free passage of vessels through the vital waterway.     
Iran played down the seizure of the ship, which it said was a small vessel that was smuggling oil. 
Iranian state TV aired footage of a vessel called “RIAH.”   
The Panamanian-flagged oil tanker MT Riah disappeared off trackers in Iranian territorial waters days ago.  
“We do this (inspecting ships) every day. These are people who smuggle our oil,” Iran’s Press TV quoted Zarif as saying, adding: “It was a small ship used to smuggle 1 million liters – not 1 million barrels – of crude oil.”      
Washington has recently beefed up its military presence and the U.S. Fifth Fleet, based in Bahrain, says that Gulf Arab states have stepped up patrols. 
Revolutionary Guards Commander-in-Chief Hossein Salami said on Thursday that Iran had adopted a defensive strategy, but warned that “if our enemies make any mistakes ... our strategy can become an offensive one.” 
Oil prices jumped on Thursday after news of the ship seizure. They later fell, however, on weakness in U.S. equities markets and an expectation that crude output would rise in the Gulf of Mexico following last week’s hurricane in the region.    
The United States on Thursday imposed sanctions on an international network of companies and their agents it said were involved in the procurement of materials for Iran’s nuclear program.

Available on Amazon for about ₹2,800, it doesn't include the Alexa device itself.

Alexa could add color and suspense to your murder mystery game nights if it's getting a bit stale lately. X2 Games, created by Atari co-founder Nolan Bushnell and Hollywood creative director Zai Ortiz, has released an Alexa-powered board game entitled St. Noire. And, yes, it's exclusively available through Amazon. To be clear, you won't be hearing Alexa's robotic voice when you play the game, so you don't have to worry about the assistant ruining your immersion. The technology simply powers the game's immersive background sounds and cinematic voice performances, which are made up of over 2,500 lines of dialogue performed by actors portraying 12 different characters. 
The game randomizes the identity of the killer and the victim every playthrough to keep things fresh. As the hard-boiled detective solving the mystery, you'll have to visit various locations (including seedy bars, of course) in the game to talk to characters. Not everyone will be telling you the truth, obviously, so you'll have to find inconsistencies in their statement and piece clues together to find the culprit.
Ortiz said they were really excited with the prospect of "gamifying voice technology by fusing cinematic storytelling with board games." He added: "By incorporating voice-control mechanics into the traditional tabletop format, we are transforming the board game landscape, as well as pushing the boundaries of what Smart Speaker gaming means."
St. Noire is now available on Amazon for $40, but that doesn't include the Alexa device itself. We hope you got an Alexa device during Prime Day if you're a murder mystery fan looking to give this a try. In the coming days, the game will also debut at San Diego Comic Con, where Bushnell and Ortiz will be speaking about it and "gamification technology' as the future of gaming.

Islamabad [Pakistan], July 19 (ANI): A day after International Court of Justice (ICJ) held Pakistan of violating the Vienna Convention, Islamabad on Friday said modalities are being worked out to grant consular access to Kulbhushan Jadhav."Pursuant to the decision of the ICJ, Commander Kulbhushan Jadhav has been informed of his rights under Article 36, Paragraph 1(b) of the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations. As a responsible state, Pakistan will grant consular access to Commander Kulbushan Jadhav according to Pakistani laws, for which modalities are being worked out," said Pakistan's Foreign Office in an official statement. ICJ on Wednesday asked Pakistan to grant Jadhav consular access holding Islamabad guilty of violating the Vienna Convention.The court also asked Pakistan to review its order of death sentence awarded to Jadhav facing charges of espionage and conspiracy against Pakistan in what was seen as a major win for India.Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan on Thursday said his country will proceed as per the law in the Jadhav case."Pakistan shall proceed further as per law," he said while alleging that Jadhav is "guilty of crimes against the people of Pakistan".The ICJ by a vote of 15-1 in the Jadhav case upheld India's claim that Pakistan is in egregious violation of the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations on several counts, India's External Affairs Ministry spokesperson Raveesh Kumar said."We also appreciate the direction of the ICJ that Pakistan should review and reconsider the conviction and sentence given to Jadhav by Pakistani military court," he added.Government sources in New Delhi said Jadhav is innocent and that "he was kidnapped from Iran, where he was residing and carrying on business after retiring from the Indian Navy.There is absolutely no clarification by Pakistan about the circumstances of his arrest".Jadhav, 49, was purportedly "arrested" from Balochistan by Pakistani security forces on March 3, 2016, after he allegedly entered the country from Iran as claimed by Islamabad.It was on March 25, 2016, that then Foreign Secretary of Pakistan Aizaz Ahmad Chaudhry had informed the Indian High Commissioner in Islamabad of Jadhav's "arrest."Since then, Pakistan has not offered any explanation as to why Islamabad took over three weeks to inform the Indian High Commissioner about Jadhav's arrest.Jadhav was sentenced to death by a Pakistani military court on April 11, 2017.Following this, India on May 8, 2017, approached the ICJ against Pakistan "for egregious violations of the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations, 1963" in the matter.India alleged that Pakistan is in breach of Article 36(1) (b) of the Vienna Convention, which obliged Pakistan to inform India of the arrest of Jadhav "without delay".

Dhoni India's best captain only as per statistics: Gautam Gambhir
Former India cricketer Gautam Gambhir has said that MS Dhoni is India's best captain only as per statistics. "But that doesn't mean that other captains have done badly. Sourav Ganguly has done good captaincy; we have won outside under him. Under Virat Kohli's captaincy, we have won ODI series in South Africa and Test series in Australia," he added.

CricTracker
Former India opener Gautam Gambhir is known for his sharp analysis and he never minces a word while putting forth his viewpoints. The 37-year-old, who has now become an MP after contesting the general elections this year after quitting the game, recently said that there are Indian captains who have done better than MS Dhoni. He cited the names of Sourav Ganguly, Anil Kumble and Virat Kohli as captains who have led India to glorious feats and added that it is not right to give all credits for success to the captain and blame him when otherwise.
Dhoni is India’s most successful captain as per the statistician’s book. He has led India in 60 Tests, 200 ODIs and 72 T20Is and won 27, 110 and 41 games, respectively. While nobody is there close to him as of yet (among the current captains like Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma who replaces the former) in the limited formats, Kohli is just one Test short of equalling Dhoni’s record of 27 wins. He will better Dhoni’s record wins in Tests if India win 2-0 against the West Indies in the upcoming series in the Caribbeans.

“If you see the statistics, then he (Dhoni) is the best captain. But that doesn’t mean that other captains have done badly. Sourav Ganguly has done good captaincy; we have won outside under him. Under Virat Kohli’s captaincy, we have won ODI series in South Africa and Test series in Australia.
It is true that MS Dhoni has won us two World Cups (2007 and 2011) but it is not fair to give all credit to the captain for success and criticise only him when it doesn’t go your way. Dhoni has won the Champions Trophy and World Cups but other captains have also taken India forward. Captains like Anil Kumble have done the job though not for long; Rahul Dravid also led India to win in England,” he said in an exclusive interview to TV9.
Gambhir had once said in the past that the best captain under who he has played is Kumble. He also said that with different captains winning and losing in different countries, it is difficult to judge who is better than whom. The former opener maintained that Dhoni will be considered the best if one is only judged in terms of winning the World Cup.

I didn't know there'd be Super Over in case of tie in WC final: Boult
New Zealand pacer Trent Boult, who bowled Super Over for New Zealand in 2019 World Cup final against England, has admitted he didn't know there was going to be a Super Over in the final. "When I saw three off two that's when umpires said to us there would be a Super Over [in case of a tie]," he added.

He was one of the central figures of the eventful final of the Cricket World Cup played at the iconic Lord’s between England and New Zealand last Sunday. Trent Boult misjudged a catch from Ben Stokes and he landed on the boundary rope with the ball in his hand in the penultimate over of the match. And then, in the final over that he bowled, a deflection off Stokes’ bat hurt them as it was sent for four overthrows, turning the game in favour of the hosts.
Boult returned to his country on Thursday with some of his colleagues and is yet to get over the pain of losing the title clash by the count of boundary – a rule that many had found bizarre. The 29-year-old left-arm pacer even tendered an apology, saying he was “sorry for letting everybody down” in relation to the final loss. He was also upset that he had gone for a six in the final over. Twelve runs in two deliveries brought England back into the game and the match ended in a tie after England scored 241 while chasing a target of 242.

“It’s been a long flight home but it [the defeat] probably hasn’t sunk in yet. I wish it would, so we can all get over it but it’s one of those things that we probably won’t get over for a long time,” Boult, who took 17 wickets from 10 matches in the World Cup, told reporters after reaching Auckland. “We’ve just been on a plane 15 hours and there were a lot of Kiwis saying ‘we felt for you’. I didn’t really know what to say.”
He even said that he would want to walk his dog on the beach in a bid to forget the experience and termed it something that will be difficult to forget even over a few years.
“Obviously, we’re all hurting and we’re sorry for letting everyone down. I just want to get home, walk my dog along the beach and try to forget about it but it’s gonna be a hard one to swallow for the next couple of years,” the Kiwi pacer said.
New Zealand’s only big consolation is that their captain Kane Williamson was picked as the Player of the Tournament.

England’s long wait for winning the World Cup title came to an end when the Three Lions beat New Zealand in the Final at the iconic Lord’s Cricket Ground in London. After 102 overs to awe-inspiring action on the pitch, at least runs couldn’t separate the hosts and the Black Caps. It eventually came down to the number of boundaries where Eoin Morgan & Co were ahead by a fair distance.
In the mandatory 100 overs, the teams ended with 241 runs each. Thereafter, the Super Over ended in a tie as well with both the sides, scoring 15 runs each. Martin Guptill’s run-out on the last ball of the one-over eliminator brought the curtains down on the closely fought contest. The Kiwis had to return empty-handed one more time after their disappointment in the final of the 2015 World Cup.

England, on the other hand, qualified for the final of the mega event for the first time since 1992 when Imran Khan’s Pakistan beat them. Following the victory at the Home of Cricket, the English team was showered with praises from the cricketing fraternity. Even the Queen wrote for the national team, expressing her delight after the stupendous victory at the renowned venue.
In the meantime, a fan took a heartfelt step and dedicated something special to the 32-year-old Ireland born Morgan. A man by the name James Bridgland was blessed with a baby boy in the morning on July 17. James named the newborn baby after the victorious English supporter to ensure that ‘Sunday’s events are remembered even more often’
The supporter uploaded an adorable picture of his newborn baby. He tagged Morgan and wrote, “@Eoin16 please meet Henry Eoin Morgan-Bridgland, born today at 11am. Just to ensure Sunday’s events are remembered even more often!,”

After the gesture, Morgan was definitely filled with glee and happiness. He is currently oozing pride following England’s dream run in the tournament and a supporter, naming his son after him, is only a cherry on the cake. The English skipper replied to the tweet and wrote, “That’s very cool. Congratulations.”

Selectors must tell Dhoni he's not India's 1st choice keeper: Sehwag
Ex-India opener Virender Sehwag has said that the duty of the selectors is to reach out to MS Dhoni and inform him that he is no more being seen as India's first choice wicketkeeper-batsman going forward. "I wish the selectors had asked me as well about my plans so I would also have been able to inform them," he added.
https://www.timesnownews.com/sports/cricket/article/on-ms-dhoni-s-retirement-speculations-virender-sehwag-breaks-his-silence/455776?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts
Times Now
Soon after Men in Blue lost to New Zealand in semi-finals of ICC World Cup 2019, fans were waiting with bated breath to see whether former Indian captain MS Dhoni hangs his boots. While 50-over World Cup was said to be Dhoni’s last assignment in the showpiece event, speculations are rife that he might have played his last match in India colours. As the selection committee meets on July 19 to announce India’s squad for the upcoming tour to West Indies, former experts have shared their views on whether Dhoni should finally retire from all formats of the game.
When asked about his take on Dhoni’s future, former Indian cricketer Virender Sehwag, who played under Dhoni’s captaincy, opined that the Ranchi cricketer has the right to take a call on his retirement. The Nawab of Nazafgarh further opined that MSK Prasad should reach out to Dhoni to talk about his future if they are not seeing him as the first-choice wicketkeeper-batsman going forward.
“It should be left to MS Dhoni to decide when to hang his boots. The duty of the selectors is to reach out to Dhoni and inform him that he is no more being seen as India’s wicket-keeper batsman going forward. I wish the selectors had asked me as well about my plans so I would also have been able to inform them,” Sehwag said during a panel discussion.
While Sehwag took an indirect dig at Sandeep Patil, the then chief selector, who was also on the panel, in his defense, said, “The responsibility to talk to Sachin about his future was given to me and Rajinder Singh Hans while the same responsibility was given to Vikram Rathore for Sehwag. We had asked him and he said he had spoken with Sehwag. But if Sehwag is saying that Vikram did not talk to him, I would like to take responsibility for the same.”
Sehwag, who never hesitates in speaking his mind, immediately replied, “Vikram Rathore spoke to me after I was dropped. It would have made sense if he spoke to me before that. There’s no point talking to a cricketer once he is dropped. If MSK Prasad speaks to Dhoni after he is dropped, what would Dhoni say – that he would play first-class cricket and the selectors should pick him if he scores runs. The point is that the selectors should reach out to cricketers before they are dropped.”
It has also been reported that the selectors now see Dhoni as a mentor who can groom Rishabh Pant to fit into his shoes going forward.

Driver stops Mumbai local train, urinates in front of it; video viral
A video of a driver of a Mumbai local train stopping the train and urinating in front of it has gone viral. In the video, the motorman can be seen urinating even as another train passes by on the other track. The train was stopped between Ulhasnagar and Vithalwadi railway stations. The Central Railway said it would investigate the incident.

Times Now
Mumbai: In a shocking incident, a motorman of a Mumbai-bound local train stopped the train between Ulhasnagar and Vitthalwadi railway stations in order to attend nature's call on the tracks on Wednesday. 
The incident, which was caught on camera, took place on Wednesday afternoon when the train was moving towards Mumbai. Locals present at the spot shot the video of the motorman urinating on the track in front of the halted train. The video quickly went viral on social media. 
An eyewitness, Sonu Shinde, told a daily that he was on his way to work when he saw the train halt in between the two stations and the motorman alight from the train. 
As the motorman got down from the locomotive, Shinde decided to capture the incident. 
According to reports, the train had stopped midway without any technical snag or any red signal.
Later, it was revealed that the motorman had decided to step down from the train to urinate. 
Meanwhile, the Central Railway has said that it would be examining the video for its authenticity. 
Incidentally, in November last year, a similar incident had taken place when an assistant loco pilot stopped a long-distance AC train between Nalasopara and Vasai stations and urinated on the railway tracks. The entire incident was again caught on camera by a local resident.  
Generally, if a loco pilot has to answer the nature's call, they have to send an SOS to the control room informing them of the situation, following which arrangements are made at the next major station.
For motormen on suburban trains, the rule states that they have to wait till their trip is completed before they use the washrooms.

Man claims he found pic of his amputated leg on cigarette packets
A man in France claimed he found a picture of his amputated leg used on cigarette packets, as a warning against smoking, without his consent. His son had discovered the picture, which bore recognisable burns and scars when he bought a packet last year in Luxembourg, according to reports. The man had lost his leg in an attack in Albania.
https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jul/18/amputated-leg-image-on-tobacco-warning-used-without-consent?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts
The Guardian
A man in France has lodged a complaint after claiming an image of his amputated leg was used as a health warning on tobacco packets across the EU without his permission.
The 60-year-old man, who lives in Metz, eastern France, claims a picture displayed on a packet of rolling tobacco alongside the message “smoking clogs your arteries” is of his leg.
The tobacco was bought in Luxembourg by his son who said he recognised in the picture the burns and scars of his father’s leg, according to reports in French media.
The European commission, which is responsible for the graphic images of smoking-induced disease on cigarette packets, rejected the claim, saying any similarity was purely coincidental.
Under a 2014 law all cigarettes and rolling tobacco sold in the EU must carry a warning of the health problems caused by smoking, which should consist of text and a photograph covering at least 65% of packaging.
The European commission says every person depicted in its library of 42 images signed a consent form. “We can confirm that the individual mentioned is not depicted in the library of health warnings,” said a European commission spokesperson for health and food safety.
Antoine Fittante, a lawyer for the complainant, said: “We will have no trouble to prove that this is my client.” He said he had written to the commission and to a French hospital said to have taken a photograph of his client’s leg. “My client feels betrayed, wounded in his dignity to see his disability on cigarette packets in tobacco shops. One must admit this isn’t very nice.”
His unnamed client lost his leg in 1997 after an attack in his native Albania. Six weeks before the apparent discovery on the tobacco packet last year, the man visited a hospital in France where a photograph of his leg was taken.
According to the commission, the current crop of 42 pictures was chosen in 2014 following consultations with lawyers to check consent declarations. The photographs are used on a rotating basis to prevent the images from losing their shock value.
“Any similarity to other individuals not having given consent, however unfortunate, is purely coincidental,” states a commission document on the policy.

Hiranandani to invest ₹1,000 crore to set up first data centre
Hiranandani Group has said it plans to invest ₹1,000 crore to develop its first data centre park at Panvel in Navi Mumbai under the brand Yotta. The data centre will come up by this December at an integrated township that the company is currently developing. H-Energy, the group's energy arm, will provide the power requirements to operate the data centre.

MUMBAI: Hiranandani Group on Thursday said it plans to invest  ₹1000 crore to develop its first data centre building as part of an integrated township that the company is currently developing at Panvel in the outskirts of Mumbai
Being built over 18 acre land parcel, the company’s first data centre park called ‘Yotta’ would comprise 5 buildings with a total size of around 30 lakh sqft.
“This year we are looking at putting about  ₹1000 crore into our first data centre in Panvel," said Niranjan Hiranandani, founder and managing director, Hiranandani Group. Spread across 820,000 sqft, the first centre of 7200 racks with 50 MW would be operational by December 2019.
H-Energy Pvt Ltd, the oil and gas arm of the Group, will provide the power requirements to operate the data centre parks. The energy vertical is managed by Hiranandani’s Dubai-based son Darshan Hiranandani, who is also the chief executive officer of the group.
“There are certain necessities of talents and expertise required to get into this business. First we have land, we are capable of construction , we have built data centres in the past, besides we have expertise of H-Energy. We are bringing all the expertise under one platform to build the largest and most cost effective data centre in the country," Hiranandani said.
The government Digital India campaign along with the growth of Internet of Things (IoT), big data and artificial intelligence have opened up a huge opportunity for setting such data centres in the country. Besides, the growth of e-commerce firms have also expanded the need of having large organised data centres.
The Mumbai-based developer is also gearing up to launch similar data centre parks in Chennai and in other part of Mumbai as well. While the first park is being built as part of an existing integrated township Fortune City at Panvel, construction in the Chennai park would start from March next year.
The company has also roped in Sunil Gupta, former executive director and president of Netmagic as managing partner and chief executive officer of the new business vertical.
“We shall offer practically unlimited scalability of Colocation space and Power at our Data Centre parks to OTT players like Google, AWS, Microsoft, Alibaba, Tencent , Netflix, Facebook , Apple etc. for their cloud availability zones / clusters, for better manageability of their operations and enhanced cost effectiveness," Gupta said.
In the recent past, Hiranandani Group has also diversified into warehousing and logistics park business. The company has been in talks with strategic partners to launched its first warehousing park spread across 5 million sq. ft, on a 250-acre plot it owns in Pune. In an interview with Mint, Hiranandani had said the plan is to create a new industrial warehousing business worth up to  ₹3,000 crore over the next two-three years.

Boeing to pay ₹340 crore to 737 MAX crash victims' families
US planemaker Boeing on Wednesday said it will dedicate $50 million (more than ₹340 crore) of the $100 million fund it created after two crashes of its 737 MAX planes to provide payments to families of those killed. The crashes killed 346 people. The world's largest planemaker has hired veteran US compensation expert Ken Feinberg to oversee the distribution.
https://in.reuters.com/article/ethiopia-airplane-boeing/boeing-to-make-50-million-in-payments-to-737-max-crash-victims-families-idINKCN1UC1NU?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts
Reuters
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Boeing Co said on Wednesday it will dedicate half of a $100 million fund it created after two crashes of its 737 MAX planes to provide payments to families of those killed, with veteran U.S. compensation expert Ken Feinberg hired by the world’s largest plane maker to oversee the distribution. 
The announcement of Feinberg’s hiring came minutes before a U.S. House of Representatives hearing featuring dramatic testimony by Paul Njoroge, a father who lost three children, his wife and mother-in-law in a 737 MAX Ethiopian Air crash in March. 
Feinberg told Reuters his team will “start immediately drafting a claims protocol for those eligible,” with the first meeting with officials from Chicago-based Boeing later this week in Washington. Feinberg has administered many compensation funds including for victims of the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks on the United States, the 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill, General Motors ignition switch crashes and numerous school shootings. 
The 737 MAX, Boeing’s best-selling jet, was grounded globally in March following the Ethiopian Airlines crash after a similar Lion Air disaster in Indonesia in October. The two crashes killed 346 people. 
Njoroge, 35, told reporters after he testified he did not think the public would trust Boeing going forward. “Do you want to fly in those planes? Do you want your children to fly in those planes?” Njoroge asked. “I don’t have any more children.” 
Njoroge told a House subcommittee he still has “nightmares about how (his children) must have clung to their mother crying” during the doomed flight. 
Njoroge, who was born in Kenya and lives in Canada, said Boeing has blamed “innocent pilots who had no knowledge and were given no information of the new and flawed MCAS system that could overpower pilots.” 
Boeing did not address specific questions raised by Njoroge but said in a statement “we truly regret the loss of lives in both of these accidents and we are deeply sorry for the impact to the families and loved ones of those on board.” 
A Boeing official told Reuters last month that after a new software flaw emerged the company will not submit an MCAS software upgrade and training revision until September, which means the planes will not resume flying until November at the earliest. U.S. airlines have cancelled flights through early November as a result of the 737 MAX’s grounding. 
Boeing shares closed up 1.9% Wednesday. 
Acting FAA Administrator Dan Elwell told Fox Business Network on Wednesday that the agency has made a lot of progress since the plane’s grounding. 
“We have discovered some anomalies and then we have directed Boeing to mitigate those anomalies,” Elwell said, declining to set any timetable for returning the plane to service.  
“The 737 MAX is not going to fly until it passes the most thorough and intense look,” said Elwell, adding that he had spent several hours with Njoroge during a recent meeting. 
Boeing said on July 3 it would give $100 million over multiple years to local governments and non-profit organizations to help families and communities affected by the crashes in Indonesia and Ethiopia. 
Feinberg, who will jointly administer the fund with lawyer Camille Biros, said the other $50 million in the fund was  earmarked for government and community projects.  
Boeing reiterated on Wednesday that the money distributed through the fund would be independent from the outcome of any lawsuits. The company is facing a slew of litigation from the families of victims of both crashes. 
“Through our partnership with Feinberg and Biros, we hope affected families receive needed assistance as quickly and efficiently as possible,” Boeing Chief Executive Dennis Muilenburg said in a statement. 
Boeing’s initial announcement of the $100 million fund was met with anger by some victims’ families, who described the offer as a publicity stunt. 
At the hearing in Washington, Representative Peter DeFazio, chairman of the House Transportation Committee, said he would call Boeing officials to testify at a hearing. DeFazio said the committee was in the middle of an in-depth investigation and had just received a “trove” of documents that panel investigators were reviewing.

Knew Neymar wanted to leave before Copa: PSG manager Tuchel
French side Paris Saint-Germain manager Thomas Tuchel said he was aware that Neymar "wanted to leave" the club before Copa America. "I am always disappointed when a player turns up late but it's clear between us, now it's between the club and Neymar," Tuchel added. This comes amid reports of Neymar being linked with a return to former club, Barcelona.

Times Now
There's no bigger player than Neymar which is being discussed in the current transfer market. The Paris Saint-Germain forward has been seen flirting with former club Barcelona hoping to return to Camp Nou but the sort of money that is required to avail his services is making things difficult for the Spanish outfit. Although the Brazilian hasn't publicly expressed his intentions of leaving France, manager Thomas Tuchel has revealed that he has been aware of the player's willingness to leave even before the Copa America 2019 started.
Quite possibly giving their best attempt towards signing Neymar, Barca had reportedly offered Ousmane Dembele, Philippe Coutinho and EUR 40 million to sign their former forward but the attempt has been rebuffed by the Ligue 1 champions, who, as per media reports, are only interested in signing the player for cash.
Amid such a situation where the player doesn't want to remain a part of the club, but is finding it increasingly difficult to force his way out, the biggest headache lies on the head of the manager - whose job is to get the best out of the player despite the fact that he is unsettled at the club.
Tuchel, who arrived in France last season, said that the topic will be discussed between the club and the player. As far as the German is concerned, things have already been made all clear.
"I knew that he wanted to go before the Copa America, but it's a topic between the club and Neymar," Tuchel was quoted as saying."It's all clear between us, now it's up to the club and Neymar."We work together, it's something between the club and him."
Neymar seems to be on the move but there aren't many clubs in the world that can afford him. The 27-year-old had arrived at PSG in 2017 in a EUR 222 million move but the French giants' inability to progress as a competitive side has left him frustrated.
In case a return to Barcelona falls through, Neymar might look to try his luck with one of the other big clubs, including Barcelona's arch-rivals Real Madrid - who seem to have the wherewithal to cater to PSG's demands.
Neymar wasn't a part of the PSG side that defeated Dynamo Dresden 6-1 in a pre-season friendly on Tuesday. Last season's top-scorer Kylian Mbappe scored a brace for the team while Julian Draxler also found the net in the convincing victory.
While the league has been a cakewalk for PSG for the past few seasons, it's the Champions League where they would be put to test again, especially if Neymar manages to leave.

BJP MLA brings bed sheet, pillow to Assembly as party stages dharna
BJP MLA Prabhu Chavan arrived at the Assembly with a bed sheet and pillow as BJP decided to stage an overnight dharna. The House was adjourned after the Congress-JD(S) members accused BJP of kidnapping its MLAs and started shouting slogans. In protest, BJP members declared they would stay in the House overnight till the time the trust vote is decided.

DK Shivakumar, Congress sais, “Today on floor of the house, MLA Madhu Swamy (BJP) said ‘the same Supreme Court which helped you to sit there is helping us’ it means whatever judgement came out of SC, he has categorically misused it. We respect SC, they’re not helping anyone.”
Karnataka Governor Vajubhai Vala has written letter asking to prove majority on the floor of the assembly (vote of confidence) by 1:30 pm tomorrow.
BS Yeddyurappa, BJP said, “We are demanding voting on the motion but the Chief Minister is reluctant to take it up as he has confirmed himself that he has lost confidence of the house and the people. Everybody knows Congress-JD(S) have only 98 MLAs, we have 105.”
Congress MLA Shrimant Patil said, “I went to Chennai for some personal work & felt some pain in the chest there. I visited hospital & on the suggestion of the doctor, I came to Mumbai and got admitted here. Once I recover, I’ll go back to Bengaluru.”
Karnataka Ministers MB Patil and DK Shivakumar are in conversation with BJP MLAs including state BJP chief BS Yeddyurappa at Karnataka assembly, after BJP MLAs said they would sit on an over night ‘dharna’ in the house demanding consideration of floor test today


New Delhi: In a breather for the embattled Karnataka coalition government, senior Congress leader Ramalinga Reddy has agreed to hold back his resignation and vote for the government during today’s trust vote.
“I will take part in the assembly session tomorrow and vote in favour of the party. I will continue to remain in the party and serve as MLA,” Reddy told news agency PTI.
The former minister is among the 13 rebel MLAs of Congress who tendered their resignations withdrawing their support to the 14-month-old Kumaraswamy government in Karnataka.
While Reddy withdrew his resignation letter hours before the trust vote, the other rebel MLAs camping in Mumbai were firm on not taking back their resignations or attending the session.
In what appeared to be a near-death for the state government, more than 16 lawmakers, including three from the Janata Dal (Secular) (JD(S)), and two Independent legislators, resigned from the Assembly, leaving the ruling Congress-JD(S) coalition tottering on the brink of collapse.
The survival of the Karnataka government hangs on the floor test which will decide whether the executive enjoys the confidence of the legislature. The Supreme Court on Wednesday had given liberty to Assembly Speaker KR Ramesh Kumar to arrive at a decision within a timeframe. The apex also maintained that the 15 disgruntled Congress-JD(S) MLAs cannot be compelled to participate in the proceedings of the assembly.
In the case if the resignations of the 15 rebel MLAs are accepted or if they remain absent from the Assembly, the coalition’s tally will plummet to 102 and the existing Congress-JD(S) government will topple.

The New Indian Express
KOTA: The Rajasthan government has formally launched a training programme for school students, in line with the National Cadet Corps practice, aiming to curb rising adolescent delinquency and make them aware of basic laws and legal procedures.
The training programme initiated jointly by the state education and police departments will be available in selected government schools in the current academic session, officials said Thursday.
The two-year programme for students of classes 8 and 9 aims to curb rising adolescent delinquency, strengthen the teenagers mentally and physically, and make them aware of basic laws and legal procedures, they said.
Under the programme, the government school students would be trained as Student Police Cadets (SPC), who, after the training, would also render voluntary services in public functions such as the Republic Day and the Independence Day in their respective areas, one of the officials said.
On the guidelines of the central government, the SPC training programme has been launched in 930 state government schools and 70 Kendriya Vidyalayas, said Ranu Sharma, an officer at the community police headquarters and state nodal officer of the programme.
She said as many as 15 modules covering all aspects of public and personal life, including personality development, physical and mental growth and social responsibility, have been developed for the SPC training which would be imparted at three levels that include indoor classes, outdoor activities and visits to relevant places and offices.
Sharma said the pilot project of the SPC programme was a "great success" in 39 schools of the state. The schools selected for the SPC training programme would be granted Rs 1 lakh for the two-year course, she said.

What do Indians mean by non-stop honking: Mercedes-Benz India CEO
Mercedes-Benz India CEO Martin Schwenk, who moved to Pune last year, said he doesn't understand what people "mean by the incessant honking". When asked which aspect of India took the most time adjusting to, Schwenk said, "The Indian 'head bob' did take me some time to get used to." He added he finds Indians to be very friendly and competent.
https://www.livemint.com/mint-lounge/business-of-life/-i-find-indians-to-be-very-friendly-and-competent-1563380248653.html?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts
Livemint
Martin Schwenk likes to keep his expectations of the unknown to the minimum. This way, he finds himself being pleasantly surprised, something that proved to be true even when he moved to Pune with his wife in late 2018.
The 53-year-old German managing director and chief executive of Mercedes-Benz India, who calls France home, is a true-blue expat, what with his job taking him to Germany, the US, Austria and South Africa. “I have always been curious about venturing into new things and countries. It instilled a feeling of always looking for more," he says.
Moving in
Schwenk doesn’t believe in pre-conceived notions before setting off on a new adventure. “Before you move, your perception is made by the press, photos, people around you. I have always found the reality very different when you actually start living in the place." Schwenk had never been to India before and knew from experience that each place in the world is interesting when you don’t know what to expect. “You will always find something you like and you will find something that you don’t like about each place. It’s part of life," he says. Having said that, he adds, he was expecting India to be “Incredible India", and a melting pot of cultures, colours, spices and people. “I don’t want to say something for the sake of pleasing, but I find Indians from all walks of life extremely approachable," Schwenk says.
“The language barrier isn’t as high as it is in some other countries I’ve lived in." He believes that people in India go out of their way to understand and accommodate people even without being able to speak a common language. The friendliness and welcoming nature were a pleasant surprise to him, and unlike anything he has experienced before. This trait made it easy for Schwenk to adapt to his new workplace easily too.
“I find Indians to be very friendly and competent. Another thing I saw here was that my colleagues are very curious. They are always looking to develop, whether it is themselves or the business," points out Schwenk. He believes their positive spirit and can-do attitude is almost infectious, and made his new start much easier.
He began his stint in India by taking the time out to listen and learn. He also believes in respecting his colleagues’ history and way of working, and assumes they are good at what they do. Does that mean his way of working is democratic? “Democratic is a big word, isn’t it? I simply listen to everything they have to say, and challenge their thoughts on the basis of my own experiences. Then we get into an open creative dialogue. In the end, we arrive at whatever works best as the next step."
Life in a new country
When asked which aspect of India took the most time adjusting to, Schwenk says, “I’ll admit that the Indian ‘head bob’ (moving the head in a way that could mean a ‘yes’ as well as a ‘no’) did take me some time to get used to. I also don’t understand what people mean by the incessant honking." On a more serious note, he believes the infrastructure in India could do with some improvement, although he is already seeing the government take some concrete steps. There needs to be “enforcement of rules" coupled with awareness and stricter laws, he says.
Home sweet home
Schwenk manages to get through most weekends without frequently checking his work-related emails. “My colleagues need to find other ways to reach me if they need to," he laughs. He loves reading, cooking, eating Indian food and discovering new restaurants with his wife, or taking the occasional weekend trips out of town.
“I used to love cycling in the woods back home in France. Unfortunately, I find the traffic a little chaotic here, so I make do by cycling in the gym." The one thing he misses about home the most is having his entire family together. His three children all study in universities around the world, but he is thankful for technology that helps him stay in constant touch with them.
Moving on
When the time comes for him to move from India, Schwenk is certain he will miss the people most of all. Whether he will extend his stay depends on what he accomplishes in his time here. “I like it here, and so does my wife. I have no reason to think that I have to disappear after my three years here. The job is interesting, the market and the country are big and I’m sure even after three years there will be a lot of challenges. If there are any left, I might as well stay here," he says.Expat Speak asks foreign nationals living in India what clicks and what irks them about the work culture of the country.

People help rescue whales stranded on US beach; video goes viral
Dozens of people helped push a pod of pilot whales back into deeper water after they came close to the shore on Saint Simons Island's East Beach in Georgia, US. The rescuers were able to push back six pilot whales, while three died. Onlookers captured a video of the incident, which has gone viral on social media.

Dozens of beachgoers and lifeguards battled to help a pod of pilot whales back into deeper waters after coming too close to the shore of the U.S. state of Georgia earlier this week, although authorities said that three of the animals had died. 
Around 50 short-finned pilot whales were spotted in the shallow waters off St. Simons Island on Tuesday, the Georgia’s Department of Natural Resources (DNR) said in a statement.
Nine pilot whales - a species of oceanic dolphin that grows 7 metres long and can weigh up to 3 tonnes - stranded themselves in the surf and while rescuers where able to push six back into deeper water, three perished, the DNR said.
Onlookers captured the impromptu rescue on videos that have since drawn hundreds of thousands of views online. The footage showed several glossy black pilot whales flailing in knee-high water surrounded by small groups of people trying to push them away from the shallows.

Officials checked beaches and marshes along the island’s coast by helicopter and did not spot anymore stranded whales, the DNR said.
Clay George, a biologist with the Georgia Wildlife Resources Division, told the New York Times that “something when wrong” for the creatures, which normally swim 100 miles (160 km) offshore.     
“We’re cautiously optimistic that the group dodged a bullet  and that they’re now on their way to deeper water,” Clay was cited as saying.

1975 video of woman kissing cricketer goes viral over #SareeTwitter
A video of a woman in saree sprinting towards the pitch and kissing the then 22-year-old batsman Brijesh Patel during an India-West Indies Test in 1975 went viral. A user shared the video as part of the #SareeTwitter challenge, writing, "Sorry this #SareeTwitter cannot be beaten." "She definitely wasn't saree about what she did," a user tweeted reacting to it.

Over the last few days, there’s a trend going on in Twitter by the name of #SareeTwitter where women are sharing pics of theirs, wearing sarees. From the likes of Sonam Kapoor Ahuja to Priyanka Gandhi, a number of other renowned personalities have also taken up the challenge. Meanwhile, a funny video, surrounding the same is doing the rounds on social media platforms.
However, the clip was regarding an incident that took place way back in 1975 during a Test match between India and the West Indies. A woman, wearing a black saree, went running onto the cricket pitch. She dodged all the police personnel and went up to the then 23-year-old cricketer Brijesh Patel. Moreover, she kissed the batsman for a brief while and then went away, smiling.

A Twitter user posted the video with #SareeTwitter and mentioned that it can’t be beaten. The user captioned the video and wrote, “Sorry this #SareeTwitter cannot be beaten.” Replying to the video, a Twitter user wrote, “She definitely wasn’t saree about what she did,”

As far as Brijesh Patel is concerned, he played quite a few games, donning the national colors. He made his international debut in a Test match versus England in Manchester where he could only manage eight runs. Patel went on to ply his trade in 21 Tests in which he managed 972 runs at an average of 29.45. His top score of 115* came against the West Indies in Port of Spain back in March 1976.
That knock turned out to be his only international ton. He also churned out five half-centuries in the format. Moreover, Patel had the privilege of playing ODI cricket as well where he scored 243 runs at an average of 30.37 with one fifty. His last international appearance came back in 1979 against Sri Lanka in Manchester itself. At the domestic level, he has 36 centuries and 59 fifties.
He was one of the first Indian players to be a natural player for the shorter version of the game. After hanging his boots from the game of cricket, he became a Test selector and then went in administration and elected as the secretary of the Karnataka State Cricket Association (KSCA).

Telangana minister's grandson makes TikTok video atop govt vehicle
A TikTok video of Telangana Home Minister Mahmood Ali's grandson Furqan Ahmed, in which he can be seen sitting on top of a government vehicle and lip-syncing to a movie dialogue, has gone viral. He enacted the argument of someone with the Inspector General of Police. Reports said the video was shot outside a hall where Ali attended an event.

Times Now
New Delhi: In yet another bizarre development over Tik Tok videos that have lately created sensation across social media, a Telangana minister’s grandson was seen misusing official properties in his video.
A purported video was circulated on social media where the grandson of Telangana Home Minister Mehmood Ali is seen sitting on top of a government vehicle and lip syncing to a dialogue from a movie on the Tik Tok mobile application.
In the video, he is seen enacting the argument of someone with the Inspector General of Police from a movie where the actor the actor threatens the others of severe consequences.
Furqan Ahmed, Ali’s grandson, is sitting atop the official vehicle of the Home Minister and recording the Tik Tok video. In the video, one of the two can be heard saying a dialigue against the IG, threatening him to mend his ways or face the consequences.
Though it is unknown when exactly the video was shot, sources indicate that it was shot outside a function hall, when the HM and his family had come to attend a marriage function last weekend.

Recently, the Mumbai cyber cell filed a case against Tik Tok users for allegedly recording a video where they were apparently seen trying to instigate revenge for the death of Tabrez Ansari, a Muslim man who was lynched in Jharkhand last month, which led to his death.
Ansari was tied to an electricity pole and beaten for over seven hours. He was also forced to chant ‘Jai Shri Ram’ and ‘Jai Hanuman’ while his assaulters thrashed him with sticks.
In April, a 19-year-old man in Delhi was shot dead by his friend while they were recording a Tik Tok video and posed with a pistol. The incident took place when one of the boys aimed the pistol towards a friend while trying to make the video and the weapon fired off, hitting the boy on his cheek.

UK woman fined ₹73L for behaviour that lead RAF jets to escort plane
A UK woman has been fined £85,000 (over ₹73 lakh) by the airline Jet2 over "abusive and dangerous behaviour" on a flight in June. Her behaviour had prompted the Turkey-bound plane to be escorted back to the UK by two Royal Air Force (RAF) Typhoon fighter jets. Chloe Haines had tried to open the aircraft door and storm the cockpit.
https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jul/18/abusive-woman-billed-for-85000-after-raf-scrambled-to-escort-plane?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts
The Guardian
A passenger who allegedly caused two RAF jets to be scrambled to escort a plane back to Stansted airport has been sent a bill for £85,000 by the airline. 
Chloe Haines has been accused by Jet2 of a “catalogue of aggressive, abusive and dangerous behaviour” on a flight bound for Dalaman in Turkey in June, including trying to open the aircraft doors during the flight. 
The 25-year-old was said to have been restrained by both crew and customers while the two Typhoon fighter jets chaperoned the plane back to Stansted. 
Two fighter aircraft caused a sonic boom as they flew to meet the plane and escort it on 22 June. 
Haines, of Maidenhead in Berkshire, was arrested by Essex police upon landing on suspicion of assault, criminal damage and endangering an aircraft. 
The force said previously she had been bailed until 30 July. 
But Jet2 said in a statement she has been hit with both an £85,000 bill and a lifetime ban from the airline. 
Steve Heapy, chief executive of Jet2.com and Jet2holidays, said: “Miss Haines’ behaviour was one of the most serious cases of disruptive passenger behaviour that we have experienced. 
“She must now face up to the consequences of her actions, and we will vigorously pursue to recover the costs that we incurred as a result of this divert, as we do with all disruptive passengers. 
“As a family-friendly airline, we take an absolutely zero tolerance approach to disruptive behaviour, and we hope that this sobering incident, with its very serious consequences, provides a stark warning to others who think that they can behave in this fashion.”

Trump was involved in talks to pay pornstar to hide affair: FBI
US President Donald Trump was directly involved in the talks to pay pornstar Stormy Daniels to hide their alleged affair, the FBI has said. Trump's then-campaign Press Secretary Hope Hicks was also involved in the talks. Daniels had claimed that she was paid $130,000 by Trump's former lawyer Michael Cohen during the 2016 election campaign to maintain her silence.
https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jul/18/trump-hope-hicks-stormy-daniels-michael-cohen-fbi?utm_campaign=fullarticle&CMP=Share_iOSApp_Other&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts
The Guardian
Donald Trump and his press secretary were directly involved in discussions that led to an illegal hush-money payment to Stormy Daniels during the 2016 election campaign, according to the FBI.
A court filing unsealed on Thursday said Trump and Hope Hicks spoke repeatedly with Michael Cohen, Trump’s longterm legal fixer, in October 2016 as Daniels – also known as Stephanie Clifford – threatened to sell her story of an affair with Trump.
“I believe that at least some of these communications concerned the need to prevent Clifford from going public,” an FBI agent wrote, in an application for a search warrant.
Cohen later admitted to making payments totalling $280,000 through a shell company to buy the silence of Daniels and the former Playboy model Karen McDougal, who also alleged she had an affair with Trump.
The new disclosures raise the possibility that Hicks lied to the FBI. Hicks told an agent in an interview that “she did not learn about the allegations made by Clifford until early November 2016”, the new filings said. Hicks, who is now a senior executive at Rupert Murdoch’s Fox Corporation, has denied wrongdoing.
The filings were released at the federal court in Manhattan, where Cohen pleaded guilty last year to campaign finance and personal financial crimes. Cohen began a three-year sentence in federal prison in May this year.
I believe that at least some of these communications concerned the need to prevent Clifford from going public
They said Trump and Hicks had a four-minute call with Cohen on the evening of 8 October 2016, a day after the leak of an NBC recording of Trump boasting that he grabbed women by their genitals, as an effort to silence Daniels apparently began.
Cohen had not spoken with Hicks for weeks beforehand and typically only had a call with Trump about once a month, according to the agent, who said Cohen and Hicks “spoke again for about two minutes” soon after the call with Trump.
Following the calls with Trump and Hicks, Cohen embarked on a flurry of calls and texts with executives at American Media, the publisher of the National Enquirer, which later admitted helping Trump cover up hush-money payments.
Numerous additional text messages, calls and frantic discussions between Cohen and others about the payoff to Daniels were detailed in the filings. Cohen “spoke to Trump for approximately five minutes” on 28 October, the day the payment was finalised, according to the FBI.
The filings were unsealed after Judge William Pauley disclosed on Wednesday that federal investigators had ended their inquiry into Trump’s hush-money payments to two women who alleged they had extramarital affairs with him.
Prosecutors therefore appear to have decided against bringing criminal charges against executives from the Trump Organization for involvement in the payoffs. Cohen was repaid with checks signed by Trump and his eldest son, Donald Jr.
Redacted versions of the search warrant documents were made public by federal prosecutors in March this year. They showed that Mueller persuaded a judge within weeks of being made special counsel in 2017 that Cohen may have been secretly working for a foreign government. Ultimately no charges were brought on that.
The Department of Justice had tried to continue redacting the names of people who were not charged, but was ordered on Wednesday to reveal the information by Pauley.
“The campaign finance violations discussed in the materials are a matter of national importance,” Pauley wrote. “Now that the government’s investigation into those violations has concluded, it is time that every American has an opportunity to scrutinize the materials.”
When he pleaded guilty, Cohen said he had acted “in coordination with” Trump as part of an attempt to stop allegations being aired that could damage Trump’s presidential campaign in its final weeks.
In a statement on Wednesday, Cohen’s attorney Lanny Davis expressed astonishment that the case had been closed without charges against others involved, “especially since prosecutors found that virtually all of Michael’s admitted crimes were done at the direction of and for the benefit of Donald Trump.”

Iran says it seized foreign tanker smuggling 1 million litres of oil
Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps has seized a foreign oil tanker, claiming it was carrying one million litres of smuggled fuel, Iran's state media said. Iran had earlier provided assistance to the same tanker as had it suffered a technical glitch. Iran's move comes after one of its tankers was seized in Gibraltar for allegedly transferring oil to Syria illegally.

The Guardian
Fears for maritime security in the strait of Hormuz, a vital route for oil shipping, have grown after Iran announced it had impounded a foreign tanker it said was smuggling fuel in the Gulf.
State television quoting Iran’s Revolutionary Guards said the vessel was intercepted south of Iran’s Larak Island on Sunday after issuing a distress call.
“A foreign vessel smuggling 1m litres of fuel in the Larak Island of the Persian Gulf has been seized,” the station said. “The vessel that Iran towed to its waters after receiving a distress call was later seized with the order from the court as we found out that it was smuggling fuel.”
The Iranians did not initially identify the ship or its owners, but semi-official news agencies suggested the ship was the Panamanian-flagged MT Riah, a ship that went missing on 14 July and appeared to have been taken into Iranian waters in the strait of Hormuz.
Nothing has been heard of the ship since it stopped transmitting its location in the early hours of Sunday. Iran did confirm on Tuesday, without naming Riah, that it had helped tow an unidentified ship in distress, but gave no further details.
The Revolutionary Guards said in the latest statement that the vessel had been impounded “with an order from the court as we found out that it was smuggling fuel” to foreign ships. The ship is capable of carrying 2m litres and had 12 crew on board. It said it had not impounded any other ship.
Speaking to reporters in New York, the Iranian foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, dismissed the incident as a routine marine policing matter.
He said: “It’s not a tanker. It’s a small ship carrying a million litres, not a million barrels, of oil. We do it every other day. These are people who are smuggling our fuel. This is … one of the things that we do in the Persian Gulf, because of the heavy subsidies that we provide for our own fuel products.”
In the current heightened tensions, western diplomats will fear the seizure of the ship is an Iranian attempt to exert diplomatic pressure.
Giorgos Beleris, oil research manager for Refinitiv, said that, although Riah was small for a tanker and could dock easily, it had been recently operating at anchorages. “This could hint at something potentially shady – we can’t be certain,” he said.
The UK Foreign Office said it was seeking further information on the ship and insisted that freedom of navigation was paramount.
The Iranian seizure could be seen as a tit-for-tat reaction to the seizure of the Iranian-owned and Indian-crewed Grace 1 tanker a fortnight ago by Royal Marines off Gibraltar.
On Thursday, the British foreign secretary, Jeremy Hunt, and Boris Johnson, the expected new prime minister, held talks with Gibraltar’s first minister, Fabian Picardo, to discuss what to do about the Grace 1.
Picardo revealed he had met with Iranian officials in London to discuss how “to de-escalate all issues arising”.
In telephone talks with Zarif at the weekend, Hunt offered to release the ship if there was an undertaking that the ship’s oil would not be taken to Syria, a country that is subject to EU sanctions.
The Iranians have said the ship was not bound for Syria, but has refused to name its planned destination.
Tensions between the US and Iran have soared, with Washington dispatching warships to the Gulf, and Tehran resuming higher uranium enrichment.
The UAE says four commercial ships off its eastern coast 'were subjected to sabotage operations'.
Yemen's Houthi rebels launch a drone attack on Saudi Arabia, striking a major oil pipeline and taking it out of service.
Saudi Arabia blames Iran for the drone attack on its pipeline.
A rocket lands near the US embassy in the Iraqi capital, Baghdad, without harming anyone. It's not clear who is behind the attack, but after the initial reports, Donald Trump tweets: 'If Iran wants to fight, that will be the official end of Iran. Never threaten the United States again!'
Senior Pentagon officer Vice-admiral Michael Gilday says the US has a high degree of confidence that Iran's Revolutionary Guards were responsible for the explosions on the four tankers in the Gulf of Oman.
Saudi Arabia says 26 people were wounded in an attack by Yemen's Houthi rebels on an airport in the kingdom's south-western town of Abha.
Two oil tankers near the strategic strait of Hormuz were reportedly attacked in an assault that left one ablaze and adrift. 44 sailors were evacuated from both vessels and the US navy assisted.
Iran’s Revolutionary Guards say they have shot down what they called a US 'spy' drone they claim was flying in in the country’s airspace. The US military confirm one of its drones has been taken down, but say it was in international airspace.  
Donald Trump reportedly gives approval for the US military to launch strikes on Iran in retaliation for the loss of the drone, before pulling back at the last minute.
The Iranian and US presidents trade insults, with Hassan Rouhani suggesting that Donald Trump suffered from a “mental disorder” and Trump once more threatening Iran with “obliteration”.
Iran summons UK ambassador over an incident off Gibraltar as Royal Marines seize a tanker the UK suspects of carrying oil to Syria.
The International Atomic Energy Agency, the body tasked with verifying Iranian compliance with the terms of the nuclear deal, verifies that Tehran has breached the agreed 3.67% limit for enriched uranium.
The UK government says three Iranian boats were warned off by the frigate HMS Montrose after Iranian boats 'attempted to impede' a British oil tanker in strait of Hormuz. Tehran denies involvement.
Iran says it has seized a foreign oil tanker in the Gulf. A report on state TV says the ship was smuggling oil but does not say which country crew are from.
Iran denies a claim by Donald Trump that the US destroyed one of its drones in the strait of Hormuz. The US president says the USS Boxer took ‘defensive action’ against an unmanned aircraft. Tehran's deputy foreign minister, Abbas Araqchi, tweeted: “We have not lost any drone in the Strait of Hormuz nor anywhere else. I am worried that USS Boxer has shot down their own UAS [unmanned aerial system] by mistake!”
The UK is deeply sceptical of the Iranian explanation and is awaiting a clear undertaking that the ship will not be sailing to Syria.
Unlike the US, the UK has no general policy of trying to block Iranian oil sales, but Tehran regards the British action as part of an attempt to support the US campaign to reduce Iranian oil exports to zero.
The disputes over the ships are all part of wider manoeuvring between Iran, Europe and the US over the future of the Iran nuclear deal signed in 2015 and known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPA).
Donald Trump pulled the US out of the deal a year ago, saying its terms did not restrict Iran from acquiring a nuclear bomb, but the Europeans have continued to back the deal.
Iran has started to lessen its commitments to JCPOA in the past month in protest at what it regards as the EU’s failure to set up an effective mechanism between Iran and Europe to maintain trade. An increase in trade with Europe was always seen by Iran as a central benefit of signing up to the restrictions imposed in the nuclear deal.
The seizure of the latest ship, following a series of attacks and interruptions of shipping over the last fortnight in the Gulf, will put the issue of maritime security in the strait of Hormuz back at the heart of international discussions.
In the last months there have been six unattributed attacks on Gulf shipping as well as an attempt to intercept a British ship in the Gulf a fortnight ago.
The US has sent advanced fighter jets and thousands of extra troops into the Middle East, while attacks on oil tankers and the shooting down of a US military surveillance drone by Iran have added to the fears of armed conflict.
The US has been pushing for an internationally coordinated maritime force to accompany cargo through the strait, and Bahrain has agreed to hold a conference to develop these plans. The Bahrain conference is not due to be held until October and as many as 60 nations are expected to attend.
Referring to the US plans to install surveillance and protection for ships passing through the Gulf, Brian Hook, the US special representative on Iran, said Washington had already sent an aircraft carrier and B-52 bombers to the region, adding that “the move has disrupted and deterred much of what we feared” with Iranian plots in the area.
Hook said he would meet ambassadors on Friday to promote the US plan to build a maritime coalition to deter further attacks on oil tankers in the Gulf.

China's debt tops 300% of GDP, now 15% of global total: IIF
China's total corporate, household and government debt rose to 303% of GDP in the first quarter of 2019, according to the Institute of International Finance (IIF). This is up from 297% in the same period a year earlier and makes up about 15% of all global debt. China's economic growth slowed to a 27-year-low of 6.2% in the second quarter.
https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-economy-debt/chinas-debt-tops-300-of-gdp-now-15-of-global-total-iif-idUSKCN1UD0KD?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts
Reuters
(Reuters) - A key gauge of China’s debt has topped 300% of gross domestic product, according to the Institute of International Finance (IIF), as Beijing steps up support for the cooling economy while trying to contain financial risks. 
China’s total corporate, household and government debt rose to 303% of GDP in the first quarter of 2019, from 297% in the same period a year earlier, the IIF said in a report this week which highlighted rising debt levels worldwide. 
The IIF is a private global financial industry association, based in Washington. 
“While authorities’ efforts to curb shadow bank lending (particularly to smaller companies) have prompted a cutback in non-financial corporate debt, net borrowing in other sectors has brought China’s total debt to over $40 trillion - some 15% of all global debt,” the report said.  
“Of note, onshore bond issuance suggests a big pickup in borrowing by local governments and banks this year.” 
China’s economic growth slowed to 6.2% in the second quarter, its weakest pace in at least 27 years, as demand at home and abroad faltered in the face of mounting U.S. trade pressure. 
To revive investment and protect jobs, Beijing has been encouraging banks to lend more, particularly to struggling smaller firms. It has also unveiled billions of dollars in tax cuts and infrastructure spending. 
In the first half of this year, local governments’ total net bond issuance reached 2.1765 trillion yuan ($316.5 billion), the finance ministry said on Tuesday. 
Chinese officials have said repeatedly said debt risks are manageable overall.

Author of 50-yr-old note in bottle that washed up on shore found
The author of a 50-year-old note in a bottle that washed up on shore in Australia has been found. The note, written by Paul Gilmore when he was 13-years-old in 1969, was recently found by a father-son duo during a fishing trip on a South Australian beach. Gilmore's sister said that he's currently on a cruise in the Baltic Sea.
https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/jul/17/search-for-british-author-of-50-year-old-message-in-a-bottle-washed-up-in-australia?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts
The Guardian
The British author of a message in a bottle that recently washed up on the South Australian coast after more than half a century has been found – and he is currently out to sea, his sister says.
South Australian man Paul Elliot and his son Jyah told ABC radio they found the bottle on the Eyre Peninsula’s west coast recently while fishing.
Elliot said he was looking for the author, Paul Gilmore, who described himself in the note as a 13-year-old English boy travelling on a ship along the southern Australian coast from Fremantle to Melbourne.
The note is handwritten on paper with Sitmar Line’s company name at the top and is dated 17 November 1969.
In it the teenager says he is travelling on board the Fairstar, a ship that brought many British migrants to Australia during the 1960s under the assisted passage scheme.
The boy urges whoever finds the note to reply to him and gives an address in Melbourne.
On Thursday, the ABC reported that it had tracked down Gilmore’s sister, Annie Crossland.
“It’s amazing, absolutely incredible,” she told the ABC. “He’ll be chuffed to bits.”
In another twist, Crossland told the ABC from the UK that he was currently on a cruise in the Baltic Sea.
“The last time he was on a ship was probably going to Australia. Cruises aren’t his thing,” she said.
Crossland, who was on board, recalled seeing her brother writing letters and dropping them into bottles. He had dropped about six into the ocean, he said.
The ABC said it was believed the bottle was dropped on the final leg of the journey between Fremantle and Melbourne.
Shown the letter by the ABC, Paul Gilmore’s brother, David said he was amazed. “I’m looking at the message now and yeah, I can see it’s my brother’s writing — he’s obviously a bit younger then,” he said.
The family lived in Australia until 1973, before returning to the UK.
Oceanographer David Griffin said the bottle could not have remained afloat for 50 years off the south coast because “the ocean never stays still”.
Griffin suspected that the bottle had been buried on a beach for years, then refloated by a storm.
“If it had been dropped in anywhere in the ocean somewhere south of Australia, then there’s no way it’s going to stay actually at sea moving around for more than a year or two,” he told the ABC.
The author gave his position as “1,000 miles east of Fremantle”.
However, it is not clear whether the author actually meant 1,600 kilometres out of Fremantle, which would have included a journey south along the west coast before turning east.
Last year, a West Australian woman found what is thought to be the world’s oldest message in a bottle.
Tonya Illman found the 132-year-old gin bottle in the dunes near Wedge Island. Inside, she found a roll of paper printed in German and dated to 12 June 1886, which was authenticated by the Western Australian Museum.

Congress, NCP MLAs to join BJP soon: Maharashtra BJP chief
Maharashtra BJP chief Chandrakant Patil on Thursday claimed that some Congress and NCP MLAs will resign and join the BJP within a week or 10 days. Patil, however, refrained from revealing names of the opposition legislators likely to join the saffron party. "The fun of life lies in the uncertainty. So, let it remain that way," he said.

The New Indian Express
SOLAPUR: Some Congress and NCP MLAs will resign and join the BJP within a week or 10 days, the saffron party's newly-appointed Maharashtra unit chief Chandrakant Patil claimed on Thursday.
The NCP was quick to hit back at Patil over his claim, saying he was making such a statement to create confusion in the opposition camp ahead of the Assembly polls.
"There will be resignations of lot many Congress, NCP MLAs this week," Patil told reporters at the government rest house here.
The BJP leader, however, refrained from naming the opposition legislators who are likely to switch over to the ruling party. "The fun part of it will be missing if I reveal the names. The fun of life lies in the uncertainty. So, let it remain that way," he said cryptically.
On Wednesday also, Patil said one should not be surprised if any of the five Maharashtra working presidents of the Congress joined the BJP in the coming days.
The Congress last Saturday appointed Balasaheb Thorat as its state unit president.
It also appointed Nitin Raut, Basawaraj M Patil, Vishwajeet Kadam, Yashomati Chandrakant Thakur and Muzaffer Hussain as its working presidents for the state.
NCP chief spokesperson Nawab Malik said Patil's comments implied the ruling party lacked enough candidates to fight the state Assembly polls, due in September-October, and therefore, the attempt to create confusion.
Malik exuded confidence that no one from the NCP was going to switch over to the BJP.
"They want to create confusion among the opposition rank and file. Their claims suggest they do not have candidates and hence, are trying to import candidates from other parties. No one from the NCP is going to defect (to the BJP)," Malik said.

Tata Chemicals may produce Li-ion batteries for EVs: Reports
Tata Chemicals is reportedly planning to set up a factory to manufacture lithium-ion batteries, mainly for the electric vehicle (EV) segment in India. Reports said the firm has already acquired land in Dholera town of Gujarat to build the factory. Tata Chemicals will reportedly play a key role in Tata Motors' plan to devise an EV ecosystem in India
https://www.livemint.com/industry/manufacturing/tata-chemicals-may-make-lithium-ion-cells-1563383778370.html?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts
Livemint
MUMBAI: Tata Chemicals Ltd plans to set up a factory to make lithium-ion cells, said two persons directly aware of the matter, as it seeks to capitalize on the emerging electric vehicle (EV) industry in India.
The Tata group company, which recently demerged its fast-moving consumer goods business, also plans to undertake research and development on lithium-ion technology to develop suitable applications for the domestic market, especially the EV industry, said the two persons cited above, requesting anonymity.
According to the people mentioned above, Tata Chemicals will play a key role in the long-term plan of sister company Tata Motors Ltd to devise an EV ecosystem in India. They said Tata Chemicals has already acquired the land in Dholera town of Gujarat’s Ahmedabad district for the factory.
Details such as the investment towards the new factory and operational timelines could not be ascertained immediately.
“This (lithium-ion cell manufacturing) is a sector that we are exploring very actively," said a spokesperson for Tata Chemicals. The spokesperson however declined to comment on the proposed plant.
According to Tata Chemicals’ FY19 annual report, “the company intends to set up operations in li-ion batteries, battery actives and li-recycling, to cater to the growing EV revolution in India at the appropriate time".
The factory is expected to augment Tata Motors’ ambitions to build a sustainable EV ecosystem. The Mumbai-based automaker, which has set up a dedicated EV business unit, is also working closely with other group companies such as Tata Power, Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), Tata AutoComp Systems and Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) in this field.
In a 12 July interview, Shailesh Chandra, president, electric mobility business and corporate strategy, Tata Motors, said the intent of teaming up with group companies is to bank upon the specific individual strengths without losing focus on the core domain, ensuring faster time-to-market for the new generation EVs and building an ecosystem, which can support wider technology adoption in the domestic market.
“We are talking to Tata Chemicals on lithium-ion cell manufacturing, working with Tata Power on providing us with EV charging infrastructure. We have to localize EV parts and that’s where Tata AutoComp is helping us," Chandra said at the time.
Tata Motors is also working with Tata Motors Finance and Tata Capital to devise financing solutions, including vehicle leasing for the planned EV ecosystem. “We have this whole ecosystem of Tata companies working together to see if we can make it (EV ecosystem) work," Chandra said.
For the EV business, Tata Motors is working on identifying micro-markets such as the fleet segment across select cities to roll out its electric cars. It has supplied electric versions of its Tigor compact sedan to Mumbai’s Aaron Travels and Bengaluru’s Janani Tours. It is also in talks with Tata Power to build EV charging infrastructure across those select cities.
On the product side, it is capitalizing on the company’s Alpha and Omega passenger vehicle platforms. While the two modular platforms will spawn 12-14 vehicle models in three years, Tata Motors said both are also EV-ready. “These are electrification ready platforms and can accommodate higher range batteries into them," said Chandra, adding the company is also using the expertise of JLR in developing EVs.
Tata Motors is also leveraging TCS’ capabilities in developing BMS (battery management system) for EVs. “We have TCS helping us on BMS because they have been working on it with global manufacturers," Chandra had said.

Reliance Brands, a subsidiary of Reliance Industries Ltd., has completed acquisition of British toy retailer Hamleys for £67.96 million (about Rs 620 crore) in an all-cash deal.
In May this year, Reliance Brands had signed an agreement to acquire 100 percent stake in Hamleys Global Holdings from Hong Kong-based C.banner International.
Reliance Brands has completed acquisition of 100 percent stake of Hamleys Global Holdings through a special purpose vehicle company set up in United Kingdom for cash consideration of £67.96 million, Reliance Industries said in an exchange filing on Thursday.
Hamleys, founded in London in 1760, is one of the world's oldest retailers of toys and has changed hands several times.
In 2015, China's C.banner International had acquired Hamleys in a £100-million deal. In October last year, Sky News reported that C.banner International, which is listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, had launched a strategic review of loss-making Hamleys and was looking to sell it.
Hamleys has 167 stores across 18 countries. In India, Reliance Retail had the master franchise for the brand and operates 88 stores across 29 cities.

Credit rating agency CARE said it has sent it's managing director and chief executive Rajesh Mokashi on leave, pending completion of the examination of an anonymous complaint received by the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI).
"The board of directors of CARE has decided to appoint T.N. Arun Kumar, currently executive director (Ratings) as interim chief executive officer ("CEO") of the company. He will not be part of rating operations to ensure independence of ratings," said CARE in stock exchange filing late Wednesday evening.
Earlier this month, credit rating agency Icra Ltd, the local affiliate of Moody’s Investors Service, had sent its managing director and chief executive Naresh Takkar on leave, pending an enquiry into "anonymous" allegations against the executive.
Mint had reported that the step was taken following an anonymous complaint, which alleged that there were lapses when Icra assigned a high rating of AAA to IL&FS last year.
Last September, IL&FS defaulted on its debt payments, triggering a liquidity crisis in the financial services market.
The complainant had alleged that Icra’s top brass had meddled in assigning high ratings to IL&FS and its subsidiaries. Icra, in its earnings statement on 9 May, had told exchanges that based on Sebi’s reference, the rating firm was in the process of addressing the concerns raised in the anonymous complaint.

4 days after winning World Cup, Bayliss appointed SRH head coach
Four days after leading England to 2019 World Cup victory, Trevor Bayliss has been appointed as SunRisers Hyderabad head coach. The 56-year-old Australian's tenure with England will come to an end after the Ashes. It will be Bayliss' second stint in the Indian Premier League, having already led KKR to two IPL titles during his tenure from 2012 to 2015.

CricTracker
The Sunrisers Hyderabad (SRH) has appointed England’s World Cup-winning coach Trevor Bayliss as the head coach of the franchise. This comes as a surprising move as the team had done well under the watchful eyes of Tom Moody over the last few years. SRH won the Indian Premier League (IPL) title in 2016 and also made it to the final in 2018 under him. The franchise has now parted ways with Moody and signed Bayliss for the top job.
Tom Moody was with the franchise for the last seven years and during his stint, SRH qualified for the playoffs on five occasions and won the trophy under David Warner‘s captaincy in 2016. In a press release which confirmed Trevor Bayliss’ appointment, the franchise thanked Moody for his superb work with the team and wished the former Australian cricketer for his future endeavours.

“We would like to thank Tom Moody, who has made an enormous impact with the franchise, helping us achieve 5 playoff appearances over the past 7 years including a much treasured championship in 2016. We would also like to thank him for his work ethic and leadership over our journey and wish him all the success moving forward,” the press release read.
Trevor Bayliss has been at the centre stage of England’s resurgence in the limited-overs format. He, along with captain Eoin Morgan, turned the fortunes of the team and they deservedly won the World Cup only a few days ago at Lord’s. Bayliss is likely to resign from the helm post the Ashes series and the SRH has grabbed the opportunity to sign him for the upcoming season.
“After very careful consideration, the SunRisers franchise has decided to take a new direction with the Head Coaching role and will be parting ways with the services of Tom Moody. Trevor Bayliss, England’s 2019 World Cup-winning coach, has been appointed Head Coach of SunRisers Hyderabad. Trevor has already won 2 IPL trophies with KKR and has also won the Big Bash League and Champions League with Sydney Sixers.
“He is a proven winner and we feel that his successful track record will be ideal in taking SunRisers Hyderabad forward,” the release further read. The SRH will now be hoping that Bayliss continues his good run as the coach with them as well and work wonders with the team in IPL 2020.

Bluetooth flaw exposes user locations; Android devices safe
Boston University researchers have found a flaw in Bluetooth that could let hackers track user locations, using a third-party algorithm. The flaw was found to be present across platforms including Apple's iOS and Windows 10, with the exception of Android, researchers revealed. "The algorithm does not require message decryption or breaking Bluetooth security in any way," researchers said.
https://www.engadget.com/2019/07/17/bluetooth-vulnerability-location-tracking-boston-university/?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts
Engadget
Your Fitbit and other Bluetooth gadgets could be giving away your location data. Researchers from Boston University (BU) detected a vulnerability in several high-profile Bluetooth devices that could allow third-parties to determine your location and other sensitive information. In the wrong hands, that information could be used for stalking or abuse. That's especially concerning given that basically everyone is carrying around a Bluetooth device.
The vulnerability has to do with the way Bluetooth-enabled devices pair with each other. In that relationship, one device serves as the central connection and the other plays a peripheral role. The peripheral device sends out a signal that contains a unique address -- similar to an IP address -- and data about the connection. Most devices produce a randomized address which automatically reconfigures periodically. That's meant to protect users' privacy, but the BU researchers found that, using an open-source "sniffer" algorithm, they could identify Bluetooth connections even when their addresses changed.
While the vulnerability doesn't leak personal data, it could be used to track Bluetooth devices and their users. Android might get a pass here. The researchers say Android devices don't appear to be vulnerable, but Windows 10 and iOS devices can be tracked. Fitbit users have it the worst. According to the researchers, Fitbits don't automatically update or randomize their addresses, making them even easier to track.
A Fitbit spokesperson provided the following statement to Engadget: "As the leader in connected health and fitness category, Fitbit is committed to protecting consumer privacy and keeping data safe. The trust of our customers is paramount and we carefully design security measures for new products, continuously monitor for new threats, and rapidly respond to identified issues."
The company also said that Fitbit devices aren't able to share personally identifiable information for any users, and the company believes it would be extremely difficult to actually stalk someone using this method. "Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) technology is widespread and allows all types of devices to connect easily without draining battery power. It's important to note that this technology can only be used to confirm that an active tracker is nearby. No personally identifiable information is shared or accessible. It's highly unlikely that someone could stumble across a particular device, know who it belongs to, and track the device's movement," the company's statement says. Finally, Fitbit is keeping an eye on the situation and monitoring for any security breaches: "We are not aware of any consumer reports, inquiries or security incidents related to this issue and will continue to monitor it carefully," Fitbit's spokesperson said.
As a silver lining, thwarting this security gap can be as simple as turning off your Bluetooth connection and then turning it on again -- at least for Windows 10 and iOS devices. And don't get ready to ditch your Bluetooth gadgets just yet. As BU researcher Johannes Becker points out, "There are tons of ways to track people, with or without Bluetooth." But it's important to be aware of the signals you're sending out and who might have access to your sensitive information.
Update, 7/18/19, 1:45PM ET: This story has been updated with a statement from Fitbit.

Uber glitch charges people 100 times the normal fare for trips in US
An Uber glitch on Wednesday charged riders in several US cities 100 times their normal fare for short trips. Riders in cities including Washington and San Diego took to social media to post about the hiked rates. Uber said the glitch was fixed and the fare would be corrected so riders are charged only the amount for their actual trip.
https://www.engadget.com/2019/07/18/uber-accidental-overcharges/?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

An error in Uber's systems on Wednesday led to people being charged 100 times what their ride should have cost. One user was charged $2,053 dollars on a ride that should have cost $20.53.
The problems first surfaced in Washington, D.C. and San Diego but have since been reported as far afield as Paris. Similar issues have been reported for the UberEats service. Some customers received alerts from their banks about the charges or had their credit cards put on hold.
Uber says the issue has been resolved and apologized for the problems caused, reports the Washington Post: "We understand that this has been frustrating. There was a known issue that caused your authorization hold to be very high. Our team has already fixed this issue. Thank you so much for your patience."
The inflated fares will be corrected to the right amount, so customers don't need to call their bank to dispute the charges. However, the charges will continue to appear on credit card or bank statements "temporarily."
However, customers aren't happy about the charges or about Uber's lackluster customer service response:

Man says 'you die' as he sets fire to Japan animation studio, 30 dead
A man screaming "you die" set fire to an animation studio in Kyoto, Japan on Thursday, and at least 30 people were feared dead in the arson attack. The perpetrator had shouted as he poured what appeared to be petrol around the three-storey building, Japan's public broadcaster said. Around 70 people were in the building when the fire started.
https://in.reuters.com/article/japan-fire/thirty-feared-killed-in-arson-attack-on-japanese-animation-studio-idINKCN1UD0AR?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts
Reuters
TOKYO (Reuters) - A man shouted “die” as he doused an animation studio with fuel and set it ablaze in Japan on Thursday, public broadcaster NHK said, killing at least 33 people in the nation’s worst mass murder in nearly two decades. 
Prime Minister Shinzo Abe called the attack in the city of Kyoto - the latest grisly killing in a nation widely known for its low crime rates - “too appalling for words” and offered condolences. 
Police detained a 41-year-old man who shouted “die” as he poured what appeared to be petrol around the three-storey Kyoto Animation building shortly after 10 a.m. (0100 GMT), public broadcaster NHK reported. 
Thirty-three people were confirmed dead, an official for the Kyoto City Fire Department said.  
Fire engulfed the building and white and black smoke billowed from its charred windows. It was Japan’s worst mass killing since a suspected arson attack in Tokyo in 2001. 
Shiro Misaki, a 47-year old owner of a neighbourhood bar  five minutes from studio, said he was driving nearby when he saw the thick smoke. 
“Policemen were stopping traffic and it was really hazy with smoke,” he said. “Even after I got back to my restaurant I could smell the smoke.” 
The prime minister said the cause was arson. 
“Today, many people were killed and wounded in an arson murder case in Kyoto,” Abe said in a post on Twitter. “It is too appalling for words.” 
The motive was not yet known. The suspected arsonist was injured and was being treated in hospital, so police could not question him, NHK said. 
Kyoto police declined to comment. 
Kyoto, some 450 kilometres (280 miles) west of Tokyo, is the ancient capital of Japan and major tourist draw for its ancient temples and cultural sites. 
The dead were found on all three floors of the building, including in the studio, and on a staircase leading up to the roof, the fire department said. It was not clear if the roughly 10 people found dead on the staircase had been trying to escape.  
Thirty-six people had been taken to hospital by midday, the fire department said earlier, with 10 of them seriously injured. 
By Thursday night the fire department said it had completed its search of the building. 
Japanese animation, known as “anime”, includes television series and movies. A pillar of Japanese popular culture, it has become a major cultural export, winning fans around the world. 
Kyoto Animation produces popular series such as the “Sound! Euphonium”. Its “Free! Road to the World - The Dream” movie is due for release this month. 
“I am heartbroken,” Hideaki Hatta, the studio’s chief executive told reporters. “It is unbearable that the people who helped carry Japan’s animation industry were hurt and lost their lives in this way.” 
There was an outpouring of support for the studio on Japanese-language social media, with some users posting pictures of animation. Many posted with the hashtag “#PrayForKyoani” - using an abbreviation for Kyoto Animation. 
The studio has an outsized role in Japan’s animation industry that outstrips the list of works it has produced, said Tokyo-based film commentator Yuichi Maeda. 
“It has a huge presence in animation here. To have this many people die at once will be a huge blow to the Japanese animation industry,” he said. 
Violent crime is relatively rare in Japan but occasional high-profile incidents have shocked the country. 
Less than two months ago, a knife-wielding man slashed at a group of schoolgirls at a bus stop in Kawasaki, just south of Tokyo, killing one girl and the father of another, while injuring more than a dozen children.  
In 2016, a man armed with a knife broke into a facility for the disabled in a small town near Tokyo and killed 19 patients.

Airline bans pics as man posts handwritten menu, later scraps ban
Indonesia's flag carrier Garuda banned taking in-flight photos and videos after a popular travel blogger's photo showing a handwritten business class menu went viral. Following a backlash, the airline said customers can still take photos for personal use such as selfies. The blogger said both he and his fiancée were reported to police for alleged defamation over the post.

Reuters
JAKARTA (Reuters) - Indonesian flag carrier Garuda withdrew a proposal to stop passengers taking photos in cabins on Wednesday after being mocked over a plan that was introduced after a travel blogger posted unflattering photos on a flight. 
Rius Vernandes, who has more than 100,000 followers on Instagram, on Saturday posted photos and videos showing him holding a handwritten menu on note paper that he described as the business class menu on his Garuda flight from Sydney. 
Garuda said on Twitter the menu was not for passengers but had been meant as a notice for flight attendants. 
On Tuesday, a directive from the airline instructing cabin crew to stop passengers taking photos and videos mid-air was leaked on social media. 
 The issue has inflamed passions in a country that is one of Instagram’s biggest markets worldwide and where posting travel “selfies” is hugely popular. 
Garuda in a statement on Wednesday said the directive had been an internal document that had now been revised to make clear it was just appealing to passengers to respect the privacy of other passengers and flight crew on duty when taking photos. 
“This appeal is also based on reports, suggestions and input from customers/passengers who feel uncomfortable and disturbed by the shooting and documentation of activities without prior permission,” Garuda spokesman Ikhsan Rosan said, adding it was also intended to ensure its flights complied with rules and regulations. 
Rosan told Reuters that there was no link between the intended directive and the blog post by Vernandes. 
Vernandes did not respond to a request for comment but told his Instagram followers he had received an apology from the airline over the service on the flight. 
But in a later post he said both he and his fiance had been reported to police for alleged defamation over the post. 
The head of Garuda’s labor union, Tomy Tampatty, told Tempo news website that several airline employees had filed a police report accusing the bloggers of “causing a negative perception...towards the country’s national flag carrier”. 
Garuda’s Rosan said the company itself had not filed a report, only “union employees”. 
Jakarta’s Soekarno Hatta airport chief, Victor Togi Tambunan, said Vernandes and his fiancée had been reported to police over claims they had broken Indonesia’s broad internet defamation laws though they had not been made suspects. 
The policies of airlines around the world over taking photos in the cabin appear to vary depending on the carrier.

New Delhi: Less than a year ahead of assembly elections in the national capital, Delhi chief minister and Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) national convener Arvind Kejriwal on Thursday announced that residents of unauthorized colonies in Delhi will soon have ownership rights of their land.
He said the central government had given approval to the Delhi government’s proposal and the state government will begin registrations in 1797 unauthorized colonies.
“There is good news for those who live in unauthorized colonies of Delhi. Their dream of living in a permanent house will now be completed. Before elections there were promises made to them and those promises were then forgotten by other parties. This time when our government was formed we had decided that we would get those living in these colonies their right," Kejriwal said while addressing a press conference.
Kejriwal said the Delhi cabinet had approved a proposal and sent it to the centre in November 2015. The proposal has been approved by the central government.
“Yesterday evening we got a positive response on our proposal from the central government. They are ready to make them permanent. I first want to thank the central government from our side. The central government has asked some questions which will be cleared," he said.
He said that the government will soon begin registration for these colonies. He said the people living in these colonies have seen no development, and the Delhi government has undertaken works of  ₹6,000 crore for their development.
The term of the Delhi assembly ends in February next year. In the 2015 elections, the AAP-led Delhi government had come to power with a brute majority after winning 67 out of 70 seats.

Ex-Pakistani PM Abbasi arrested in ₹9,500 crore corruption case
Former Pakistani PM Shahid Khaqan Abbasi was arrested on Thursday in a nearly ₹9,500-crore corruption case related to the awarding of a contract to a liquefied natural gas firm. Abbasi had granted a 15-year contract to a company in which he was a shareholder himself. He'd awarded the contract when he was the Petroleum Minister under ex-PM Nawaz Sharif's rule.

The Financial Express
Pakistan National Accountability Bureau on Thursday arrested former Prime Minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi in connection with a case related to the award of a liquefied natural gas (LNG) import contract. Abbasi was arrested when he was on his way to attend a press conference, DawnNewsTV reported. The Bureau had summoned Abbasi to appear before it today for the probe.
However, he failed to appear following which the Bureau arrested him. The Bureau in a notice had asked the former Pakistan prime minister to appear at NAB Islamabad before Investigation Officer and Deputy Director Malik Zubair Ahmed for discussion and recording statement.
“You are advised that failing with this notice may entail penal consequences as provided in serial 2 of the schedule of the National Accountability Ordinance 1999,” DawnNews quoted the notice as saying.
According to Dawn, the notice said that Abbasi committed an offence by deceitfully, fraudulently and dishonestly causing a loss to the national exchequer. It further said that the former Pakistan Prime Minister misused his authority and obtained a pecuniary advantage through corrupt, dishonest and illegal means during the award of LNG Terminal.

This year in April, the Pakistan government imposed a travel ban on Abbasi who served as the prime minister of the country from August 2017  to May 2018.
Former Pakistan PM Nawaz Sharif’s daughter Maryam Nawaz tweeted a video of Abbasi which appeared to have been shot moments before his arrest.

The Financial Express
The Income-Tax Department has attached a ‘benami’ plot worth Rs 400 crore in Noida belonging to BSP supremo Mayawati’s brother and his wife, an official order said. The provisional order for the attachment of the seven-acre plot, “beneficially owned” by Anand Kumar and his wife Vichiter Lata, was issued on July 16 by the Delhi-based Benami Prohibition Unit (BPU) of the department. Mayawati recently appointed Kumar as national vice president of the Bahujan Samaj Party.
The order, accessed by PTI, has been issued under section 24(3) of the Prohibition of Benami Property Transactions Act, 1988. The attached asset, considered a ‘benami’ property of Kumar and his wife by the department, measures 28,328.07 square meters or about seven acres, the order said. The book value of the property is Rs 400 crore, it said.

The law stipulates that a violator of the Benami Act can face rigorous imprisonment up to seven years besides being liable to pay fine up to 25 per cent of fair market value of the ‘benami’ property. The department started initiating action under the new Benami Transactions (Prohibition) Amendment Act, 2016 from November 1, 2016 after the Modi government enforced the dormant-lying law from that year. The I-T Department is the nodal department to enforce the Benami Act in the country.

US removes Turkey from F-35 programme as it buys Russia's S-400
The US has removed Turkey from its F-35 fighter jets programme after it received the first parts of the Russian S-400 air defence system. "The F-35 cannot coexist with a Russian intelligence collection platform that will be used to learn about its advanced capabilities," the White House said. The US had earlier stopped training Turkish pilots on F-35 jets.

Reuters
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States said on Wednesday that it was removing Turkey from the F-35 fighter jet program, a move that had been long threatened and expected after Ankara began accepting delivery of an advanced Russian missile defense system last week. 
The first parts of the S-400 air defense system were flown to the Murted military air base northwest of Ankara on Friday, sealing Turkey’s deal with Russia, which Washington had struggled for months to prevent. 
“The U.S. and other F-35 partners are aligned in this decision to suspend Turkey from the program and initiate the process to formally remove Turkey from the program,” said Ellen Lord, the under secretary of defense for acquisition and sustainment. 
“The United States is spending between $500 and $600 million in non-recurring engineering in order to shift the supply chain,” she said. 
Used by NATO and other U.S. allies, the F-35 stealth fighter jet is the world’s most advanced jet fighter. Washington is concerned that deploying the S-400 with the F-35 would allow Russia to gain too much inside information of the stealth system. 
“The F-35 cannot coexist with a Russian intelligence collection platform that will be used to learn about its advanced capabilities,” the White House said in a statement earlier on Wednesday. 
Washington has long said the acquisition may lead to Turkey’s expulsion from the F-35 program. 
The Pentagon had already laid out a plan to remove Turkey from the program, including halting any new training for Turkish pilots on the advanced aircraft. 
“The situation with Turkey is a government-to-government matter and we’ll comply with any guidance issued by the United States Government,” said a spokesperson for Lockheed Martin Corp (LMT.N), the prime contractor on the jet.

Google removes 7 Play Store apps over risk of spying on user
Google has removed seven apps from Play Store over risks of their ability to track user location and access contacts, SMS and call history. The apps were detected by antivirus firm Avast, which claimed all of the seven apps were likely designed by a Russian developer. The apps have been installed a combined 1.3 lakh times, Avast said.

New Delhi: Google has removed seven stalker apps that were available on its Play Store as apps for children's safety or finding stolen phones but were being used to stalk employees, romantic partners or kids.
The apps were able to track the surveilled person's location, collect their contacts, SMS and call history.
Mobile threat researchers at anti-virus company Avast detected the apps on Google Play Store that were all likely designed by a Russian developer.
Avast reported these apps to Google which then removed them from the Play Store.
The apps have been installed a combined 130,000 times, with the most-installed apps being Spy Tracker, and SMS Tracker, both with more than 50,000 installs.
"These apps are highly unethical and problematic for people's privacy and shouldn't be on the Google Play Store," Nikolaos Chrysaidos, Avast's head of mobile threat intelligence and security, said in a statement on Wednesday.
"They promote criminal behaviour, and can be abused by employers, stalkers or abusive partners to spy on their victims. We classify such apps as stalkerware," he added.
It's hard to tell if your device has stalkerware installed on it as you will not see an app icon on your smartphone.
The apps require the person to have access to the phone they want to spy on. The person can download the apps from the Google Play Store and install them on the target device.
The app then prompts the person who installed the app to enter their email address and password. The spying app is sent there.
"Upon setup, there is no app icon, so the targeted person does not see any sign of the stalkerware app installed on their phone," said Avast.
For example, the description of "Spy Tracker" app on Google Play read: "Find out more about your child's life, interests, friends and plans. Parents are responsible for every step that their kids make. So this app is created to monitor them and protect them from dangers that can be revealed via cell phone."
According to SMS Tracker, "our app will help you monitor work time of your employees to save time and save money. Notify the users of work phones that you are going to install the app. It will teach your employees to use their time at work wisely, to reduce time spent on messengers and arrive to work in time".
In April, Russian cyber security company Kaspersky Lab said it would start flagging stalkerware as malicious. In 2018, it detected stalkerware on 58,487 mobile devices.

Instagram to hide number of 'Likes' in 6 more countries
Facebook-owned photo-sharing platform Instagram is expanding its test to hide the visibility of the number of 'Likes' on other users' posts to six more countries. This includes Ireland, Italy, Japan, Brazil, Australia and New Zealand. Instagram said the test is "because [it wants] your followers to focus on the photos and videos you share, not how many likes they get."

Would the internet be a better place if we all paid a little less attention to fake internet points? Instagram  is still trying to figure it out.
Just a few months back, Instagram started testing a design tweak that would no longer show the total number of “likes” other users’ posts had received. You could still see everyone that liked your photos and videos — but anyone else’s stuff? Don’t worry about it.
While the company hasn’t said much about how the tests are going so far, it seems they’re going well enough to expand them. Initially rolled out in just Canada, it’ll roll out to users in six more countries starting today:
Curiously, some users in Canada (the first country where hidden likes were tested) reported yesterday that likes had returned to their feed. Instagram confirmed to us that the testing in Canada is still ongoing. Meanwhile, likes seem to be gone again in Canada as of this afternoon.
We wrote about Instagram’s like-hiding experiments a few weeks prior to the public tests, after the pending rollout was discovered by reverse-engineering extraordinaire Jane Manchun Wong.
So why hide likes? Instagram says it’s “because [they] want your followers to focus on the photos and videos you share, not how many likes they get.”
In other words: when likes are public, people care too much about them. People view it as a metric of success — teasing those who get too few, or buying likes to try to gain admiration. If a post doesn’t get enough likes, people delete them to make it seem like all of their photos are hits. In theory, hiding likes from the feed but making them visible to the creator lets people get some sense of what’s working, without having to worry so much about whatever anyone else is taking away from the like count on any given photo.
Here’s what Instagram looks like with the design tweak. Note the banner up top giving the user a heads up of the change, and that the like bar just says “Liked by username and others” instead of any specific number of users:

New Delhi [India], July 18 (ANI): Union Minister Gen (retired) VK Singh on Thursday hailed the Kulbhushan Jadhav verdict and asserted that the positive judgment may make Pakistan realize their mistake.Speaking to ANI on the International Court of Justice's verdict delivered yesterday, Singh said, "The judgement is positive. With a judgment of 15:1 they have supported what we have said. It is visible that ICJ has honoured the basic conventions of law and justice and India has been successful in its mission".On being asked about whether India will further exhort more pressure on Pakistan for resolution of this issue, he said, "The way they had abducted Kulbhushan and filed a fake case, we believe something must be done about it. Hopefully, Pakistan will realise the mistake that they have made and will take action to ensure that Kulbhushan Jadhav gets justice and is returned to India. "His reaction comes after the ICJ on Wednesday continued its stay on the execution of the Indian national Kulbhushan Jadhav, held in a Pakistani jail on allegations of spying, and called for an effective review and reconsideration of the conviction.Jadhav, 49, was purportedly "arrested" from Balochistan by Pakistani security forces on March 3, 2016, after he allegedly entered the country from Iran, as claimed by Islamabad.India has held that Pakistan, which faces several problems on its border with Iran, has been using Jadhav's case to blame India for its problems in Balochistan. It has used proxy groups such as Jaish al Adl against Iran, while Iranian officials have spoken of Pakistan's sponsorship of terror activities along the Iran-Pakistan border.It was on March 25, 2016, that then Foreign Secretary of Pakistan, Aizaz Ahmad Chaudhry, had informed the Indian High Commissioner in Islamabad of Jadhav's "arrest."Since then, Pakistan has not offered any explanation as to why Islamabad took over three weeks to inform the Indian High Commissioner about Jadhav's arrest.Jadhav was sentenced to death by a Pakistani military court on April 11, 2017.Following this, India on May 8, 2017, approached the ICJ against Pakistan "for egregious violations of the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations, 1963" in the matter.India alleged that Pakistan is in breach of Article 36(1) (b) of the Vienna Convention, which obliged Pakistan to inform India of the arrest of Jadhav "without delay".

Prosecutors drop case accusing Spacey of sexually assaulting man
Prosecutors on Wednesday dropped a case accusing actor Kevin Spacey of groping an 18-year-old man at a bar in 2016 after the accuser refused to testify about a missing phone, which the defence said could prove Spacey's innocence. The man's mother alleged in 2017 that Spacey got her son drunk and sexually assaulted him. Spacey has faced several other accusations.
https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2019/jul/17/kevin-spacey-charges-dropped-sexual-assault-case-groping-teen-nantucket?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts
The Guardian
Prosecutors dropped a case on Wednesday accusing Kevin Spacey of groping a young man at a resort island bar in 2016, after the accuser refused to testify about a missing cellphone the defense says contains information supporting the actor’s claims of innocence.
Spacey was charged with indecent assault and battery last year in the only criminal case that has been brought against the actor since his career collapsed amid a slew of sexual misconduct allegations. The two-time Oscar winner was among the earliest and biggest names to be ensnared in the #MeToo movement against sexual assault and harassment that swept across the entertainment and other industries.
Spacey denies groping the man, whose mother first went public with the allegations in 2017. A phone message seeking comment was left with Spacey’s lawyer.
The actor’s accuser was ordered to take the stand earlier this month after he said he lost the cellphone he used the night of the alleged groping. The defense said it needed the phone to recover deleted text messages it said would help Spacey’s case.
The man denied deleting messages or manipulating screenshots of conversations he provided to investigators. But when he was pressed by the defense about whether he knew that altering evidence is a crime, he invoked his fifth amendment right against self-incrimination, and the judge said his testimony would be stricken from the record.
The judge then questioned how prosecutors would be able to bring Spacey to trial if the accuser continued to refuse to testify, and prosecutors told the judge they needed time to decide how to proceed.
On Wednesday, the Cape and Island district attorney, Michael O’Keefe, said in court documents that they were dropping the charge “due to an unavailability of the complaining witness”.
Prosecutors said in an emailed statement that they met with the man and his lawyer on Sunday and told him that if he would not testify in further proceedings, they could not move forward with the case. The man “elected not to waive his right under the fifth amendment”, prosecutors said.
Prosecutors said they could further pursue the case and grant the accuser immunity but then they would need more than his uncorroborated testimony.
Furthermore, “a grant of immunity compromises the witness to a degree which, in a case where the credibility of the witness is paramount, makes the further prosecution untenable”, they said.
Mitchell Garabedian, a lawyer for the accuser, said in email that the man and his family “have shown an enormous amount of courage under difficult circumstances”. Garabedian said he had no further comment.
The hearing at which the accuser testified came days after the man abruptly dropped a lawsuit he had just recently filed against the actor that sought damages for “severe and permanent mental distress and emotional injuries”. The suit was dismissed “with prejudice”, meaning it cannot be refiled.
The man did not receive a settlement to drop the civil case, his mother said. His lawyer said he dropped it because he was emotionally overwhelmed and wanted only “one rollercoaster ride at a time” and so chose to focus on the criminal case.
The man’s mother, the former Boston TV anchor Heather Unruh, alleged in 2017 that Spacey got her son drunk and sexually assaulted him at the Club Car, a bar on Nantucket where the teen worked as a busboy.
The man told police he went over to talk to Spacey after his shift because he wanted to get a picture with the former House of Cards star. He said Spacey bought him several drinks and tried to persuade him to come home with him before unzipping the man’s pants and groping him for about three minutes.
Unruh’s son told police he tried to move Spacey’s hands, but the groping continued, and he didn’t know what to do because he didn’t want to get in trouble for drinking because he was underage. The man said he fled when Spacey went to the bathroom.
Shortly after Spacey was charged, he posted a video on YouTube in the voice of his House of Cards character who was killed off after the sexual misconduct allegations emerged, saying “I’m certainly not going to pay the price for the thing I didn’t do.” Spacey has faced several other accusations.
His first accuser, the actor Anthony Rapp, said Spacey climbed on top of him on a bed when Rapp was 14 and Spacey 26. Spacey said he did not remember such an encounter but apologized if the allegations were true.
The Associated Press does not typically name people who say they are the victims of sexual assault unless they identify themselves publicly. Rapp has; Unruh’s son has not.

Neesham's childhood coach died during World Cup final Super Over
New Zealand all-rounder Jimmy Neesham's childhood coach David James Gordon passed away during the 2019 World Cup final Super Over. The former Auckland Grammar School teacher breathed his last, moments after the cricketer hit a six on the bowling of England's Jofra Archer. "How appropriate you held on until just after such a match. Hope you were proud," Neesham tweeted.

CricTracker
England and New Zealand played out the most thrilling World Cup final ever at Lord’s on July 14. Both the teams scored 241 runs in their allotted 50 overs and the match went to the super over. They scored the same number of runs in the super over as well only for the hosts to pip the opponents on the boundary count and win the trophy for the first time. The Kiwis were hard done with the absurd rules and their fans were in shock back home on Monday morning.
Jimmy Neesham was in the middle of the action in the super over and the southpaw had given a realistic chance for his team by hitting a six off Jofra Archer early. However, at the same time, the cricketer’s high school teacher Dave Gordon was battling with life and took his last breath after Neesham smacked a six in the super over.

“One of the nurses came in for the final over, the super over, and she said his breathing is changing. You know, I think Jimmy Neesham had just hit that six and he took his last breath,” Gordon’s daughter Leonie Gordon was quoted as saying by stuff.co.nz.
Jimmy Neesham who was heartbroken after the World Cup final and put up a series of tweets in disappointments also paid tribute to his teacher on social media. “Dave Gordon, my High School teacher, coach and friend. Your love of this game was infectious, especially for those of us lucky enough to play under you. How appropriate you held on until just after such a match. Hope you were proud. Thanks for everything. RIP,” Neesham’s tweet read.

Leonie Gordon was also heartened to see Neesham’s tribute and said, “It was lovely, you know, he’s kept in touch with Jimmy and he is friends with Jimmy’s father. He always had a soft spot for Jimmy Neesham, he was very proud of him. He would definitely be following his career,” she further said.
Dave Gordon taught at Auckland Grammar for as many as 25 years where he coached a few young New Zealand cricketers as well and Lockie Ferguson was also one of his students.

I am sure my dog won't be too angry at me: Boult on WC final defeat
New Zealand pacer Trent Boult, who bowled the final over and Super Over in 2019 World Cup final, said he'll walk his dog along the beach to cope with the defeat.

New Zealand pacer Trent Boult’s plans of getting over the gut-wrenching World Cup loss to England include walking his dog along the beach but he concedes that losing the trophy on boundary-count will be hard to swallow for at least a couple of years.    
Boult, who claimed 17 wickets in the showpiece and was among the star performers for the runner-ups, landed back in the country amid questions on how the Black Caps are coping after losing their second successive World Cup final.
 “Well, I’m gonna go home for the first time in about four months. Probably gonna walk my dog along the beach and try and put it aside. I’m sure he won’t be too angry at me,” Boult told reporters.

 “...it’s not gonna be something that disappears in the next couple of days. It’s probably something that’s gonna be hard to swallow for the next couple of years,” he said.    In the pulsating match on Sunday, being called the greatest World Cup final by many, the Kiwis tied the regulation 50 overs and the super over but went down on inferior boundary count.
 Boult said he has been struggling to forget the 49th over in which he took a catch of Ben Stokes off Jimmy Neesham but ended up stepping on the boundary to let the advantage slip.
 “I suppose it’s just natural to nitpick and pull apart a game like that,” he said.

 “...you just wonder those little kind of things that went your way, or didn’t go your way or whatever, it could’ve been a totally different game. Yeah, of course, I’m living the last over throughout my mind a lot.
 “Somehow we were hit for six along the ground which has never been happened before. And then, yeah, couple of run outs, to bowl them out and to see the scores level and to lose was a pretty unique situation,” he recalled.    Does he feel cheated? The answer is a firm “no.”   Asked if he would he do anything differently, Boult said he doesn’t envision another team coming as close to winning or losing the Cup like his side did.
 “It was an amazing stage to be on. Obviously saw what it meant for the Englishmen to get across the line. It could have been us. Unfortunately it wasn’t. No one is probably going to get closer to winning the World Cup or losing the World Cup as us,” said the 29-year-old.
 Exuding humility like his captain Kane Williamson, Boult said he felt apologetic towards fans who were rooting for the quintessential “nice guys” of the game.    
“You see a lot of disappointment in cricketing fans around the world, not just Kiwis but a lot of supporters that wanted us to win. It’s a shame to let everyone down really.
 “It’s hard to know that after playing 15 hours… A lot of Kiwis out there were saying ‘we felt for you’ kind of thing. Yeah don’t really know too much more to say really. Obviously we’re all hurting and yeah sorry for letting everyone down,” he said.    Recalling the 2015 final, in which the Black Caps were outplayed by Australia, Boult that loss hurts less compared to the heartbreak at Lord’s.

Neil Armstrong's Apollo 11 spacesuit goes on display after 13 yrs
Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum in Washington has put the spacesuit worn by Neil Armstrong, the first man to step on Moon during the Apollo 11 mission, on display after 13 years. Armstrong's son Rick unveiled the display on July 16, marking the 50th anniversary of Apollo 11 mission's launch. Neil Armstrong had passed away on August 25, 2012.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The spacesuit astronaut Neil Armstrong wore during his mission to the moon went on public display for the first time in 13 years on Tuesday, at the Smithsonian’s Air and Space Museum exactly 50 years to the day when Apollo 11 launched into space. 
Armstrong’s son Rick unveiled the suit along with U.S. Vice President Mike Pence who recalled how the country was deeply divided in the late 1960s but came together in pride when Armstrong became the first man to walk on the moon.

Armstrong died on Aug. 12, 2012 in Cincinnati, Ohio. 
“On top of the contributions to science and human understanding, for that brief moment, the man who wore this suit, brought together our nation and the world,” Pence said.

“Apollo 11 is the only event of the 20th century that stands a chance of being widely remembered in the 30th century,” said Pence said. “A thousand years from now, July 20, 1969 will likely be a date that will live on in the minds and imaginations of men and women, here on Earth, across our solar system, and beyond.” 
Armstrong’s suit was displayed for about 30 years at the Smithsonian before it was taken down in 2006 because curators were concerned about deterioration. 
For the past 13 years, the suit has been subject to extensive conservation work, which included interviews with the designers and creators of the spacesuit and research into the materials and products used. 
“The complexity of the suit ensured it could support human life in the harshest of environments: extreme heat and cold, radiation, micrometeorites and the threat of cuts from sharp rocks all had to be taken into consideration,” Ellen Stofan, the Washington museum’s director, said at the event.  
“As our curators note, these spacesuits were actually single-person spacecraft, but while they were designed to endure the punishment of a lunar walk, they weren’t designed to last half a century on display.” 
While the original boots worn by the Apollo 11 astronauts were left on the moon because of weight concerns, the Smithsonian does have the boots worn by astronauts on Apollo 17 which were brought back to Earth. 
Conservation work was funded by thousands of public donations. Additional funds have been raised to conserve the spacesuit of astronaut Michael Collins, who joined Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin on the Apollo 11 mission.

Not your fault, ICJ verdict given in English: Giriraj Singh mocks Pak
After Pakistan government called the International Court of Justice's verdict in Kulbhushan Jadhav case a 'Big win for Pakistan', Union Minister Giriraj Singh tweeted, "Not your fault...judgment delivered in English." The UN court on Wednesday delivered the verdict in favour of India and found Pakistan guilty of violating Vienna Convention, thereby staying the death penalty to Jadhav by Pakistan.

Times Now
New Delhi: Union minister Giriraj Singh on Wednesday took a low dig at the Pakistani delegation who had defended their stand on the Kulbhushan Jadhav case at the International Court of Justice in The Hague yesterday after the verdict was ruled in favour of India.
Taking to social media platform Twitter, the senior BJP leader responded to a tweet that was put out by the official twitter account of Pakistan government where they tweeted “Big win for Pakistan. India’s demand of release and repatriation of Kulbhushan Jadhav rejected by ICJ”, contrary to what India’s demand and eventual verdict by the ICJ was.
“Not your fault... judgement delivered in English,” Giriraj Singh said in a witty jibe at the Pakistan government.
The twitterati also joined Singh in taking digs at Pakistan, with several of them taking multiple potshots at the neighbouring country.
While one Twitter user said, “Bhai verdict English main hoga, in logo ko samjhane mein time lagega,” another said, “Besides being masters of terrorism, they are also masters of illiteracy. Can’t even read the judgement correctly. The same guys were openly claiming victory just a few hours before a humiliating surrender in Dacca in 1971.”
Another user said, “Terror Conditioned Brains in Pakistan think differently.”
The International Court of Justice yesterday ruled in favour of India and put a stay on Jadhav’s execution. The international judiciary also ordered Pakistan to review the trial that ordered the sentencing and asked the Islamic nation to provide Jadhav the consular access he deserves and ruled that by not providing it despite repeated requests, Pakistan violated the Vienna Convention.
"We expect Pakistan to do whatever it has to do including appropriate legislative measures to guarantee a fair trial. So Pakistan's conduct is under watch and if what they do is another farcical attempt, we will be back in the Court," India's counsel Harish Salve told reporters after the ICJ verdict.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi also welcomes the ICJ judgement on Wednesday and assured that the government of India will continue to work for the safety and welfare of every Indian.
“We welcome today’s verdict in the ICJ. Truth and justice have prevailed. Congratulations to the ICJ for a verdict based on extensive study of facts. I am sure Kulbhushan Jadhav will get justice. Our government will always work for the safety and welfare of every Indian,” PM Modi said.

Noida Authority to clean commercial areas at night: CEO
The Noida Authority CEO said that the city's commercial areas will be cleaned at night as sanitary workers find it difficult to sweep the areas during the day. She also directed officials to ensure the elimination of open dumping spots by August 31. Thanking the CEO, Sector 18 Market Association President said, markets also need dustbins at various spots.

The New Indian Express
NOIDA: Sweeping in commercial areas of the city will take place during night instead of day, the Noida Authority decided Wednesday, with markets associations lauding the move.
The authority's newly-appointed Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Ritu Maheshwari held an inter-department meeting where she directed officials to ensure elimination of open dumping spots at public areas within 45 days.
"There are 360 such open dumping zones in the city and the Health, Civil and Horticulture departments have been asked to work in tandem to ensure their clearance and beautification of these sites by August 31," Maheshwari said.
"Cleanliness drive should be carried out in commercial areas of the city during night time. With vehicles occupying a lot of space in markets during the day, it becomes difficult for sanitation workers to effectively sweep the area, hence this decision," she added.
The authority officials did not mention by when this new directive would be implemented but said it would be done "soon".
Sector 18 Market Association president Sushil Kumar Jain said the new CEO's decision is a commendable step, which will not only send out a good message about cleanliness but also boost trade opportunities.
"We had been demanding this for a long time. Earlier also similar efforts were made but could not sustain for long. This time we are hopeful it will work. There is also need for dustbins at various spots in markets, which will also help in maintaining cleanliness," he said.
"We are thankful to the new CEO for according priority to markets and traders but we hope her instructions are effectively implemented by the authority staff," Jain added.

I never want to be involved in a Super Over ever again: Ben Stokes
England all-rounder Ben Stokes, who was named Man of the 2019 World Cup final, has said he never wants to be involved in a Super Over ever again. The 28-year-old hit eight runs in Super Over against New Zealand. He further revealed he had suggested captain Eoin Morgan to send Jos Buttler and Jason Roy to play the Super Over.

On July 14, Sunday, the world saw probably the best ODI of all time between England and New Zealand, which was also the final of the ICC World Cup 2019. The hosts were chasing a meagre total of 242 runs set by the Kiwi team and the initial match ended up in a tie, the first for any final in tournament history and in another first in ODI history, Super Over was employed to find the champions.
Henry Nicholls made a valiant fifty in the finals as England bowlers kept the pressure on the hosts, who were looking for their first-ever world title. Somehow, they posted 241/8 in 50 overs. Their bowlers reduced England to 89/4 and then in pressure, Ben Stokes and Jos Buttler added over 100 runs to bring the team back in the final. However, Kiwis pegged the batsmen back and Stokes managed to make the 15 runs required in the last over, when 16 were needed and the match was tied, with everything coming down to the super over.

When the super over was employed for the very first time in the ODI cricket history, England batted first and needed to send two batsmen to take advantage of the six balls. However, the England all-rounder Ben Stokes revealed that he wasn’t ready to go out there and bat again with Jos Buttler, as he was angry at not finishing the game.
“I was annoyed at myself, I was angry, I thought I’d thrown it away but when I went upstairs I had to give myself five minutes because Morgs (Morgan) wanted me to go back out and do the super over. I said that we should send Jos [Buttler] and Jason [Roy] out but Morgs said we need a left and right because it’s a small boundary. I had to go out the back into the shower room and give myself five minutes. ‘I never want to be involved in one [super over] ever again,” the 28-year-old all-rounder was quoted as saying by timesnownews.
England managed 15 runs in 6 balls with Stokes hitting a six off Boult. In return, New Zealand tried their best with Neesham making 13 runs and hitting Archer for a six. However, Martin Guptill was run out coming for the second run which would have made New Zealand champions and the super over was tied. England won the contest on the basis of hitting more boundaries in the match than the Kiwis, which was seen as a controversial ruling by many.

Abdul Razzaq reveals he has had 5-6 affairs after marriage
Former Pakistan all-rounder Abdul Razzaq, during a TV programme, said that he has had "five-six affairs that also had a validity of 1-1.5 years". He further said that all those affairs happened after he got married. "How do people laugh and clap at such statements? Won't be laughing when they're at [the] receiving end," a user tweeted reacting to it.

CricTracker
Former Pakistan all-rounder Abdul Razzaq had said after his country’s heavy defeat to arch-rivals India in the cricket World Cup 2019 that he would like to coach Hardik Pandya to make him as one of the best all-rounders in world cricket. Razzaq had also made a controversial remark after India’s loss to England that seamer Mohammed Shami performed well in the match because he is a Muslim (Shami took 5 for 69 in that game). Razzaq’s frustration was understandable since Pakistan’s chances of making the quarter-finals had taken a huge blow after India lost the match.
And now, the 39-year-old former cricketer has confessed that will certainly put the cricketing world on fire once again. Razzaq made his bold confession while speaking on a TV programme. The former batting all-rounder said he has had five-six extramarital affairs that also had a validity of 1-1.5 years. And when the astonished anchor asked him whether those had happened before marriage, Razzaq said they had happened after his conjugal life started.

Razzaq’s confessions took all those who present on the show by surprise. The man had represented Pakistan in 46 Tests, 265 ODIs and 32 T20Is. He scored over 8,000 runs and took 389 wickets in international cricket.
In a matter of coincidence, Hardik Pandya too had made a similar confession on a reality show back in January. He was accused of making sexist remarks related to women and the episode had seen him getting suspended, along with KL Rahul who was also on the programme, although temporarily.
He missed the ODI series in Australia and a couple of games in New Zealand and it was a big blow for the cricketer who was just about to make a comeback after a long stint with an injury. Nevertheless, Hardik made it to the World Cup and produced a decent performance for his team, both with the bat and ball.

About his coaching proposal for Hardik, Razzaq had said in his tweets: “Today I have been closely observing Pandya and I see a lot of faults in his body balance while hitting the bowl hard. I observed his footwork as well and I see that has also let him down sometimes. If I can give him coaching, for example in the UAE, I can make him one of the better all-rounders, if not the best. If the BCCI wants to make him a better all-rounder I will always be available.”

Juventus to be called Piemonte Calcio in FIFA after signing PES deal
Juventus will be known as 'Piemonte Calcio' in the next FIFA game after signing a naming rights deal with FIFA's rival Pro Evolution Soccer. Piemonte Calcio will have its own badge and kit, designed by EA Sports. This is the first time in 25 years that FIFA will not hold the licence for the Italian first division champions.

Daily Mail
Juventus will be known as 'Piemonte Calcio' on the next FIFA game after signing a naming rights deal with Pro Evolution Soccer. 
FIFA's traditional rival have stolen a march on their video game competitor, although the names and faces of Juventus players will stay realistic. 
The 2020 version of PES secured exclusive naming rights with an agreement between Konami and the Italian champions. 
Cristiano Ronaldo's Juventus have signed a name rights deal with Pro Evolution Soccer
This deal entitles PES to the name, kit, stadium and badge for Juventus in their game. 
The licensing issue has pushed many gamers to FIFA over the years as they enjoy playing with more realism. 
But PES are fighting back and over the past few seasons have incrementally started to claim rights of their own. 
Barcelona, Liverpool and Inter Milan have agreed partnerships from everything from team strips to crowd chants. 
But the fact that Juventus and Cristiano Ronaldo are now PES property will particularly rankle given that the striker has been a cover star for FIFA in the past. 
Gamers will now have to play as Piemonte Calcio if they want to use Juventus on FIFA

India drawn with Qatar in World Cup 2022 Asian Qualifiers draw
The Indian football team has been grouped with 2022 FIFA World Cup hosts Qatar in Group E of Asian Qualifiers for the 2022 World Cup and the 2023 AFC Asian Cup. Along with Qatar, India will also play against Bangladesh and Afghanistan in Group E. India will begin their campaign at home against Oman on September 5.

The New Indian Express
KUALA LUMPUR: The Indian football team was Wednesday handed a comparatively easy draw for the 2022 World Cup second round Asian qualifiers, being clubbed with Qatar, Oman, Afghanistan and Bangladesh in Group E.
The 40 Asian countries were divided into eight groups of five teams each in the draw held at the Asian Football Confederation headquarters here.
All the teams in each group will play home-and-away round-robin matches starting from September 5.
The eight group winners and four best runners-up will advance to the final round of 2022 World Cup qualifiers and the 2023 AFC Asian Cup Finals, to be held in China.
The next best 24 teams from the second round of the joint qualifiers will compete in a separate competition for the remaining 12 slots in the 24-team AFC Asian Cup.
India avoided the big guns from Pot 1 like Iran, Japan, Korea, Australia and Saudi Arabia, but drew Asian Cup champions Qatar.
India were also not drawn alongside bigger teams from Pot 2 like Iraq and Uzbekistan.
India can beat the likes of Afghanistan and Bangladesh and will hope to play their best against Oman, as well as World Cup hosts Qatar, if they have to advance to the final round of the qualifiers.
Interestingly, India were also drawn along with Oman in the second round qualifiers of the 2018 World Cup.
The Arab nation beat India 2-1 (in Bengaluru) and 3-0 (in Muscat) in 2015.
But the latest clash between the two sides, just before the 2019 Asian Cup, had ended in a goal-less draw in Abu Dhabi last December.
India head coach Igor Stimac termed the draw "a very tough challenge".
"It will be an enormous challenge for your young team. We have been drawn into a very tough group," Stimac said.
Without singling out any team, Stimac said that "we need to respect every opposition".
"We need to respect everyone, not only teams from Pot 1, and Pot 2, but even teams from Pot 3, and Pot 4. The Intercontinental Cup showed to all how strange a game of football is.
The two teams which are playing the final (Tajikistan, and DPR Korea) are the lowest FIFA ranked teams in the tournament. That shows that everyone can beat everyone," he said.
"I will teach the team to respect the opposition, but when we step on to the pitch, we will do everything to win. That is the way I am going to prepare my team. We are just at the beginning of our journey. I hope that it will be a long one," he added.
Wednesday's draw was conducted by FIFA Director of Competitions Christian Unger and Australian legend Tim Cahill.
Asia's top-ranked side Iran, who will be aiming for a third consecutive World Cup appearance, were pooled in Group C alongside Iraq, Bahrain, Hong Kong and Cambodia.
Japan, Asia's best performers in the 2018 FIFA World Cup where they were defeated by Belgium in the Round of 16, were drawn in Group F with Kyrgyz Republic, Tajikistan, Myanmar and Mongolia.
Korea Republic, who have appeared in every edition of the FIFA World Cup Finals since 1986, will have Lebanon, DPR Korea, Turkmenistan and Sri Lanka in Group H of the Asian Qualifiers.
Saudi Arabia will face Uzbekistan, Palestine, Yemen and Singapore in Group D while Australia will go up against Jordan, Chinese Taipei, Kuwait and Nepal in Group B.
China, the host country for the AFC Asian Cup 2023, will have to navigate past Syria, Philippines, Maldives and Guam in Group A in their bid for a second appearance in the FIFA World Cup Finals.

If I travel with players, we won't have another Sindhu: Gopichand
Talking about not travelling with players like PV Sindhu on the international circuit, national badminton coach Pullela Gopichand said, "If I was just travelling, what happens to the next batch, we would never have a Sindhu come out then." He further said that he needs more coaches as he can't do it alone. "Everybody needs personal attention," he stated.

Times Now
New Delhi: India's top shuttlers have missed his court-side presence this year but national badminton coach Pullela Gopichand says he can't really help cutting down on travelling as that would come in the way of finding the next crop of world-beaters.
Gopichand hasn't been travelling with the likes of PV Sindhu on the international circuit this year and he doesn't intend to change that until next year. "If I was just travelling, what happens to the next batch, we would never have a Sindhu come out then. So we need more coaches, I can't do it alone. I need more help and support," Gopichand tod PTI in an interview.
All the top Indian players, including Olympic silver-medallist Sindhu, London Olympics bronze-medallist Saina Nehwal and K Srikanth, have achieved success under the guidance of Gopichand. But with Indian badminton growing by leaps and bounds, Gopichand has been left with less time to devote to the top players, which leave come of them aggrieved.
Last month, there were reports that the relationship between Sindhu and Gopichand has deteriorated, something which the Indian ace rubbished later on. "Everybody needs personal attention, and lot more court time from me which is not always possible. I keep getting it that 'Bhaiya, you were not there, if you were there I would have won'," Gopichand, a 2001 All England Champion, said.
"So what do you focus on? Since 2008-09, every year which is the Commonwealth and Asian Games or Olympic year I have travelled and the other year I didn't travel. So this year I'm not travelling but in 2020 I will travel."
Asked if he has chalked out his strategy for the Olympics, Gopichand said: "Last time, I travelled with the top players in the last few tournaments and then decided my plan. So, this time too ahead of the Olympics, in February and March, I will be travelling with the team and decide my plan for the Olympics."
Gopichand produced two Olympic medallists in Saina and Sindhu at the 2012 London and the 2016 Rio Games. The 45-year-old from Hyderabad hoped with new foreign coaches joining the camp, India will deliver yet again.
"Challenges that I have is about coaches. Luckily, we have a few coaches now since February. I have taken a backseat to ensure that these coaches take over and start working with the players," said Gopichand.
"We have Flandy (Limpele) and Namrih (Suroto) for doubles and Park (Tae Sang) and Kim (Ji Hyun) for women's and men's singles. So with all of them on board, now I'm able to have an overall look at the entire picture rather than focus on just individuals. I hope results will keep coming."
However, Gopichand said for consistent results, India need to put in more effort to streamline the system. "For sport to develop, you need coaches, we need players, system, and a disciplined structure. We haven't groomed any coaches. we haven't started anything, we need to focus on the domestic structure," he said.

With various steps taken by the government for promotion of sports and its infrastructure in the country in the last 5 years, winning 100 Olympic medals by 2032 could be a possibility, Rajyavardhan Singh Rathore said in the Lok Sabha on Wednesday.
Participating in a debate on Demands for Grants of Ministry of Youth and Affairs, he said the Khelo India campaign launched by Prime Minister Narendra Modi has brought a remarkable change in the arena of sports.
Rathore, a former Youth and Sports Minister, said the Khelo India campaign initiated by the Modi government has changed the attitude of the country towards sports.
Thanking Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman for the proposal to set up a National Sports Education Board during her budgetary announcements, he said, it will help widen the scope of Khelo India campaign.
Besides, he said, the government has envisaged setting up of a sports school in every district.
Rathore, an Olympic medal winner, said there is no dearth of money for sports now with setting up of the National Sports Development Fund.
He expressed hope that winning 100 medals in 2032 Olympic Games can be a realty with various steps taken by the government and pool of talents available across the country.
Participating in the debate Danish Ali (BSP) asked the government to take steps to clean up various sports associations in the country.
Hibi Eden (Cong) said the government should desist from changing the name of Nehru Yuva Kendra which has been playing a major role.
The government’s move to remove the name of Nehru would be unholy on the part of the ruling party given the tremendous contribution the first Prime Minister made in shaping India, he added.

Veteran Congress leader and MLA from BTM Layout in Bengaluru Ramalinga Reddy on Wednesday evening announced that he would continue with the Congress party. It is also confirmed that Reddy has assured the Congress that he will vote in favour of the trust vote. Reddy, who was one among the rebel legislators, had tendered his resignation to the Speaker on July 6 along with 11 other MLAs.
In a statement to the media, Ramalinga Reddy said that after several rounds of talks with the Congress leaders and the high command, he had decided to stay with the Congress.
“Due to several occurrences within the Congress party, I had resigned on July 6, 2019 as the MLA of BTM Layout. I have never sought or demanded a ministerial post. I have been with the Congress party for the last 45 years and I have been an MLA seven times. I had only resigned as an MLA but I had never said I would move away from the Congress,” Ramalinga Reddy’s statement reads.
The veteran leader and former Home Minister of the state also said that he had received several pleas from party workers requesting him to withdraw his resignation. However, Reddy did not specify whether he would withdraw his resignation.

Speaking to the media, Ramalinga Reddy said that he would not make any announcement about his resignation to the media and that he would first discuss it with the Speaker.

Working presidents to work on their own: Chacko to Sheila Dikshit
Delhi Congress in-charge PC Chacko on Tuesday wrote to Delhi Congress chief Sheila Dikshit, saying that the Delhi Pradesh Congress Committee was constituted with the order that three working presidents will work independently. Chacko added that since Dikshit is "not keeping well", he has authorised the working presidents to hold meetings of district and block committee heads and take decisions.

The New Indian Express
NEW DELHI: Stating that Delhi Congress chief Sheila Dikshit is "not keeping well", AICC incharge PC Chacko on Wednesday authorised the three working presidents to hold meetings of district and block committee heads and take decisions, seen as an attempt to dilute her powers amid a deepening turf war between the two.
Chacko wrote to Dikshit apprising her of his decision following which she issued an "action note" of her own assigning different set of responsibilities to the working presidents.
Dikshit's aides said that she was in hospital for a routine check up and was discharged on Monday, and alleged that "rumours" were being spread about her health.
In his letter, Chacko expressed displeasure that his earlier directions were not implemented and some "so-called spokespersons" of the party were issuing "irresponsible" statements and questioning the decisions of All India Congress Committee (AICC) incharge.
He said that Assembly elections in Delhi are a few months away and the working of Delhi Congress Committee has to be streamlined as early as possible.

"As you are not keeping well and hospitalised and I did not receive any reply to my letters, in the interest of the party, I am authorising the working presidents to hold meetings of district and block presidents in their respective areas and take appropriate decisions to activate the party and report to you the decisions taken," Chacko wrote to Dikshit.
In the 'action note' signed by Dikshit, working president Haroon Yusuf was allocated supervision of East Delhi Municipal Corporation, four Assembly segments(Timarpur, Burari, Okhla and Jungpura), Mahila Congress, Sewa Dal and NSUI.
Devender Yadav was assigned South Delhi Municipal Corporation and Youth Congress, while Rajesh Lilothia was allocated North Delhi Municipal Corporation and cells of Delhi Congress.
Sources said Chacko also wrote letters to the three working presidents asking them to monitor the party affairs in their respective areas and hold meetings and plan organisational programmes.
ALSO READ: Anger brewing against PC Chacko in Delhi Congress
The differences between the two leaders had surfaced in Lok Sabha elections with Chacko, and former Delhi Congress chief Ajay Maken supporting an alliance with AAP in Delhi which was strongly resisted by Dikshit and her followers.
The alliance did not come about, and Congress lost on all seven Lok Sabha seats in Delhi.
The tussle intensified as Dikshit dissolved all 280 block committees and started the process of selecting new block presidents by appointing district and block observers.
In a letter to Dikshit on last Sunday, Chacko overturned her decision to dissolve the block committees.
I am sorry to say that a senior leader of your status should not have flouted AICC rules by taking a decision leading to unrest and differences in the party. I have received numerous complaints from block presidents, ex DPCC presidents and working presidents against the action under your signature, he had written.
The three working presidents too wrote to Dikshit on last Sunday, expressing sadness that decisions were being taken "unilaterally" without even informing them.

Court withdraws order to distribute Quran for bail over communal post
A Jharkhand court has modified its earlier order which had mandated a student, accused of writing a communal post on social media, to distribute five copies of the Holy Quran for bail. The court withdrew the order after the police filed an application saying it was difficult to implement the condition. Notably, the student had refused to obey the order.

3 TN SRM Institute students kill themselves in same manner in 60 days
A 21-year-old student killed himself at Tamil Nadu's SRM Institute of Science and Technology's Kattankulathur campus on Monday, the third such incident there in a span of 60 days using the same method. The police said it has been understood that the victim had multiple arrears in his exam. In May, two students killed themselves inside the same campus.

The News Minute
On Monday, students and faculty at the SRM Institute of Science and Technology Kattankulathur campus (Kancheepuram district) woke up to devastating news. A 21-year-old student had killed himself in the campus. This was the third such incident inside the 250-acre campus in a span of 60 days, and all three students used the same method. While police sources say that the institute should have done more to avoid the deaths, faculty and some students tell TNM that this was not a case of institutional oversight.
Sree Raghav, a final year B.Tech student from Kanyakumari district, killed himself on Monday. The police are investigating the incident, but as per the first round of questioning, it has been understood that the victim had multiple arrears in his exam. In May, two students killed themselves inside the same Kattankulathur campus of the college, though different reasons were attributed to their suicides. The method that all three students used was the same, and all of them had accessed restricted areas of the campus.
(NOTE: TNM will not be revealing the method of suicide as mental health experts urge that such reporting may lead to more copycat suicides.)
A press statement from SRM Institute of Engineering and Technology expressed anguish over the incident and stated that as a policy, support and guidance is being offered by the college to students who are in need of counselling. However, speaking to TNM about Sree Raghav's suicide, a police officer at the Maraimalai Nagar station, in whose jurisdiction the college falls, said that the college should have been more careful in watching over its students.
"There have been two other suicides very recently in the same campus. The college should have installed preventive measures, and at least cordoned off restricted areas. But when our officers went for inquiry, they found that no such precautionary measures have been taken,” he said.
A professor at the college, however, told TNM that the institute had taken precautions, and the restricted area had been opened for some maintenance work only. The staff member, however, added that there is no clarity on how the students managed to access a restricted area in the previous two cases of suicides in the same campus.
A student of SRM said that students also get mailers frequently, telling them about counselling options available in case they need them. They also have a counsellor on campus, he said.
Psychological rehabilitation crucial
“People who are mentally disturbed or are in bereavement are vulnerable to copycat suicides. When they see others killing themselves, they tend to feel that it is the way out and follow them. Copycat suicides also happen among people who try it for fun and end up losing their lives,” explained Vandhana, a Chennai-based clinical psychologist. 
She added that following suicide attempts, while families and friends focus on physical health of the person who has survived, they do not focus as much on emotional well being.
“So what happens when the trauma is raw is that the next time they get triggered and attempt to kill themselves, it ends in death,” she said.
If you’re worried about a person’s mental health, there are some behavioural changes you can look out for.
Vandhana added that more suicide prevention helplines must be set up to address this issue in a holistic manner. Mass media must also do its part in preventing suicides, she added.
“Movies that give warning for alcohol and drugs, do not give similar warning for suicides. These warning one-liners don’t compensate for anything. We need to create more warning signs that are visible,” she said.
Making it clear that suicides do not happen in one day, Vandhana said that these build over a period of time and hence suicide prevention helplines must ideally double up and act as helplines which can aid people who need help to call and talk about their pain.

L&T chief AM Naik appointed as Mindtree Chairman
Larsen and Toubro (L&T) Group Chairman AM Naik has been appointed as the Non-Executive Chairman of mid-sized IT services firm Mindtree on Wednesday. The move follows L&T's acquisition of a controlling stake in the Bengaluru-based company. Mindtree CEO Rostow Ravanan, Executive Chairman Krishnakumar Natarajan and Executive Vice Chairman NS Parthasarathy had resigned earlier this month.

Livemint
Mumbai: Bengaluru-based IT services firm Mindtree Ltd., which has recently been acquired by engineering giant Larsen and Toubro Ltd. has appointed A M Naik (the current chairman of L&T) as the company's new non-executive chairman with effect from Thursday, according to an exchange filing by Mindtree.
Naik replaces Krishnakumar Natarajan, who resigned as the chairman and a board member from Mindtree on 5 July.
On Tuesday, L&T became the new promoter of Mindtree after buying a 60.59% stake in the latter and inducting three nominees from L&T as directors in Mindtree.
Mindtree's four founders, Subroto Bagchi, NS Parthasarathy, Natarajan and Rostow Ravanan, who together hold around 13.32% in Mindtree and served as directors on the company's board for two decades, quit the company after L&T succeeded in concluding its open offer on 30 June.
Mindtree, in its exchange filing, said that the company's nomination and remuneration committee and the board of directors appointed Naik after a board meeting on Wednesday.
Naik has been the group chairman of L&T for the past 20 years. He has been serving the $18 billion conglomerate for over 54 years.
"Naik mirrors the defining characteristics of the company, viz., professionalism, customer-centricity, fidelity to core values, and a passionate commitment to serving the interests of country, cause and community," read the exchange filing.
Naik was instrumental in setting up L&T's Leadership Development Academy near Mumbai, one of the few 'corporate universities' in India.
Under Naik, L&T's market capitalization, which was around  ₹2000 crore in 1999, has soared to at least  ₹2 lakh crore in 2018.
"His thrust on profitable growth ensured consistently impressive gains on both parameters...L&T's multi-geographic canvas is the outcome of his drive to internationalize operations and set global benchmarks across businesses. Overseas revenues today account for 30% of turnover," said the filing by Mindtree.
On Tuesday, L&T completed its Rs.10,000 crore acquisition of Mindtree, which marked the country's first hostile takeover in the IT industry.
Following an annual general meeting on Tuesday, three nominees from L&T were inducted on the board of Mindtree as directors.
Naik will become the fourth executive from L&T to join the board of Mindtree.

18-yr-old defender Gahlot becomes India's 2nd youngest goalscorer
India's 18-year-old defender Narender Gahlot on Tuesday became the second youngest footballer to score a goal for the national team. Gahlot achieved the feat after his 51st-minute header in India's last league match of 2019 Intercontinental Cup against Syria. Jerry Zirsanga, who scored aged 16 in May 2004, is the youngest footballer to score for India.

The 18-year-old Narender Gahlot on Tuesday became the second-youngest player to score an international goal for the Indian football team. Gahlot achieved the feat during the team’s match against Syria in the Intercontinental Cup at the EKR Arena in Ahmedabad.
He registered the goal as he headed Anirudh Thapa’s corner against Syria. This was Gahlot’s first goal for India. Mizoram’s Jerry Zirsanga holds the record for being the youngest player to register a goal for the Blue Tigers.
Jerry was 16 years and 311 days old when he scored the goal against Kuwait in 2004.
On Tuesday, India played a 1-1 draw against Syria in their last group stage match of the Intercontinental Cup.
The match witnessed a fanatic first half, as both teams had a flurry of chances, but neither team was able to convert their chances and at half-time, the scoreline read 0-0.
In the second half, Gahlot struck a goal for India, giving them lead of 1-0 in the game. Gahlot’s thumping header found the back of the net off the cross of Anirudh Thapa in the 51st minute.
However, Syria were awarded a penalty kick, against the run of play, in the 78th minute, and Firas made the most out of it, as he equalised bringing the scoreline to 1-1.
India ended their Intercontinental Cup campaign with two losses and one tied match to their credit.

Google had repeatedly faced heavy criticism over its decision to create a censored search engine to comply with Chinese laws. Google CEO Sundar Pichai, in late 2018, had said work on the project was "limited".

SAN FRANCISCO: 
Google's controversial China search engine project, named Dragonfly, has been terminated and employees working on it have been reportedly reassigned.
The controversial Chinese search engine previously in development by Google that raised privacy, censorship, and human rights concerns is finally, officially, no more, mashable.com on Tuesday quoted Karan Bhatia, Google's vice president of global government affairs and public policy, as saying.
Responding to questions from Republican Senator Josh Hawley, the top Google executive said: "We have terminated Project Dragonfly."
This unequivocal response is a departure from previous couched statements by Google executives regarding Dragonfly's status. For example, in December, chief executive Sundar Pichai told Congress that "right now there are no plans for us to launch a search product in China", the report added.
Meanwhile, the tech giant's offices in the US, UK, Canada, India, Mexico, Chile, Argentina, Sweden, Switzerland, and Denmark have witnessed protests by human rights groups over its plan to re-enter China through the censored search application.
Senior Google employees have also resigned citing lack of corporate transparency after the company revealed its efforts to re-enter China through "Dragonfly".
The search engine giant had launched a search engine in China in 2006 but pulled the service out of the country in 2010, citing Chinese government efforts to limit free speech and block websites.

The Delhi government has released Rs 109 crore to all three municipal corporations in the capital for dealing with vector-borne diseases, such as dengue and chikungunya, in the ongoing monsoon season.
According to the government, the funds have been released following the direction of Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal to the urban development department.
Kejriwal directed the department to tell the BJP-led three municipal corporations — south, north and east — that there should be no excuse in dealing with dengue and chikungunya.
In a statement, the government said Kejriwal directed the department to take all necessary steps to ensure proper utilisation of funds so that preventive steps, like house-to-house visits of MCDs staff to check the spread of mosquitoes, are carried out.
North and East MCDs have been given Rs 57.15 crore and Rs 28.4 crore respectively while South Delhi Municipal Corporation got 23.57 crore under the health head.
In the past, the AAP government and the BJP-led municipal corporations have been at loggerheads on a range of issues, including strike of sanitation workers due to lack of funds.
Apart from this, under the education head, the government has released around Rs 46.75 crore to East, North and South MCDs.
North Delhi Municipal Corporation (NDMC) and East Delhi Municipal Corporation (EDMC) have got Rs 12.5 crore and Rs 22.5 crore respectively while the SDMC has been given Rs 11.75 crore under the same head.

MUMBAI: Larsen & Toubro Infotech Ltd, the IT services arm of infrastructure major Larsen & Toubro Ltd, on Wednesday said it has signed a definitive agreement to acquire the artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning and advanced analytics company Lymbyc.
This marks L&T’s fifth acquisition since its listing in 2016. In January, the firm acquired Ruletronics, which uses the Pega platform for business process management and customer relationship management solutions. A month later, it also acquired Germany-based Nielsen Partner, which specializes in Temenos WealthSuite, an integrated software solution for wealth managers.
Across these five acquisitions, the company has committed over $50 million to date, according to the company's filings with stock exchanges.
Founded in 2012, Lymbyc is a Bengaluru-based firm known for its capabilities in analytics and data-sciences space. The company leverages its proprietary product Leni, a virtual analyst that allows users to conversationally access information and insights, to solve descriptive to predictive business insights, leveraging deep learning, natural language processing, data visualization and predictive analytics. The company has customers in the US, the UK, Africa, and India.
“We believe self-service capabilities for AI and advanced analytics will be the next wave of disruption in the marketplace, and Lymbyc brings this capability to our Mosaic platform," said Sanjay Jalona, chief executive officer and managing director of LTI.
“Leni by Lymbyc is an industry-agnostic platform that solves business user’s need for experience, speed, and comprehension. I welcome Lymbyc’s experienced management team and all its employees to the LTI family," he added.
The acquisition will complement the analytics, natural language processing and data visualization capabilities of its in-house Mosaic platform, helping it improve its data discovery, analytics and ability to process large datasets, the company said. Before Lymbyc's acquisiton, both firms had also worked as strategic partners for a year.
The transaction, which is expected to close in another 4- 6 weeks, would come at a cost of  ₹38 crore to L&T Infotech, the company said in a stock exchange filing. LTI plans to pay in all-cash, as a combination of upfront and three-year staggered payments, it said.
“As a strategic business partner of LTI during last year, we have seen first hand how LTI is leading data and digital transformation agenda for its clients," said Satyakam Mohanty, founder and CEO of Lymbyc.
“With AI becoming increasingly mainstream, we are excited to join hands with LTI and to help a larger and richer set of clients. Leni, our AI-based Virtual Analyst is perfectly suited to deliver better value to business users and maximize their information and analytics investments," Mohanty added.
As on 3.10 pm, L&T Infotech's shares were trading at  ₹1,627.95 apiece, down 1.23% on the BSE, while the benchmark Sensex was trading at 39,230.93 points, up 0.26%.

Why are leaked sex scenes not being spread under actor's name: Radhika
Actress Radhika Apte, while talking about her sex scenes with Dev Patel from 'The Wedding Guest' getting leaked, said, "The scenes are being spread in my name. Why are people not spreading them under the male actor's name?" "[The film] has many other beautiful sequences...That one particular sex scene got leaked because of the psychotic mentality of society," she added.

Hindustan Times
Actor Radhika Apte has said her sex scene from The Wedding Guest got leaked because of  “the psychotic mentality of the society”. The Wedding Guest that also stars Dev Patel, has been directed by Michael Winterbottom and also stars Jim Sarbh.
Pictures from a sex scene from the movie have surfaced online and are going viral. Reacting to the leak, Radhika has said questioned why is it being labelled as Radhika’s sex scene when it also features Dev. “The film The Wedding Guest has many other beautiful sequences and the fact that one particular sex scene got leaked because of the psychotic mentality of the society. The leaked sex scene featured both Radhika Apte and Dev Patel in it. But the scenes are being spread in my name. Why the people are not getting spread under the male actor Dev Patel’s name,” a Bollywoodlife report quoted Radhika as saying.


The film based on a mysterious British Muslim man (Dev Patel) on his journey across Pakistan and India.

I won't say I have redeemed myself, I am paid to play: Ben Stokes
England all-rounder Ben Stokes, who was arrested in 2017 for a street brawl and later found not guilty, has said that the 2019 World Cup win was not his redemption. "I won't look back and say I redeemed myself. I am an athlete and a cricketer and it's what we are paid to do, to win trophies," he added.

On July 14, Sunday, the world saw probably the best ODI of all time between England and New Zealand, which was also the final of the ICC World Cup 2019. The hosts were chasing a meagre total of 242 runs set by the Kiwi team and the initial match ended up in a tie, the first for any final in tournament history and in another first in ODI history, Super Over was employed to find the champions.
Henry Nicholls made a valiant fifty in the finals as England bowlers kept the pressure on the hosts, who were looking for their first-ever world title. Somehow, they posted 241/8 in 50 overs. Their bowlers reduced England to 89/4 and then in pressure, Ben Stokes and Jos Buttler added over 100 runs to bring the team back in the final. However, Kiwis pegged the batsmen back and Stokes managed to make the 15 runs required in the last over, when 16 were needed and the match was tied, with everything coming down to the super over.

When the super over was employed for the very first time in the ODI cricket history, England batted first and needed to send two batsmen to take advantage of the six balls. However, the England all-rounder Ben Stokes revealed that he wasn’t ready to go out there and bat again with Jos Buttler, as he was angry at not finishing the game.
“I was annoyed at myself, I was angry, I thought I’d thrown it away but when I went upstairs I had to give myself five minutes because Morgs (Morgan) wanted me to go back out and do the super over. I said that we should send Jos [Buttler] and Jason [Roy] out but Morgs said we need a left and right because it’s a small boundary. I had to go out the back into the shower room and give myself five minutes. ‘I never want to be involved in one [super over] ever again,” the 28-year-old all-rounder was quoted as saying by timesnownews.
England managed 15 runs in 6 balls with Stokes hitting a six off Boult. In return, New Zealand tried their best with Neesham making 13 runs and hitting Archer for a six. However, Martin Guptill was run out coming for the second run which would have made New Zealand champions and the super over was tied. England won the contest on the basis of hitting more boundaries in the match than the Kiwis, which was seen as a controversial ruling by many.

Shubman should be groomed for India's no. 4 batting spot: Whatmore
Former Sri Lanka coach Dav Whatmore has said that batsman Shubman Gill should be groomed for Team India's number four batting position. "He has got the technique to be a number four...I am sure he will have a long career," he added. The 19-year-old Shubman was the player of the tournament in 2018 Under-19 World Cup.
https://www.crictracker.com/dav-whatmore-backs-shubman-gill-to-solve-indias-no-4-issue/?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts
CricTracker
The conundrum surrounding India’s number four continues to cause problems aplenty for the Team. The problem started right after Yuvraj Singh was dropped in mid-2017. Since then, India have tried out a number of batsmen without much success. The experimentation started with KL Rahul and later the likes of Dinesh Karthik, Hardik Pandya and Suresh Raina were tested. However, those experiments did not yield the desired result.
India then recalled Ambati Rayudu in 2018 and it looked like the team’s search was finally over. A good show in the Asia Cup, a fine century against West Indies and some handy knocks in Australia and New Zealand bolstered Rayudu’s reputation. However, the team surprisingly dropped him for the World Cup after his poor outing in the home series against Australia. India instead picked Vijay Shankar who looked anything but impressive in England before an injury ruled him out of the tournament.

India then tried out Rishabh Pant at that crucial position. The youngster played some handy knocks but clearly lacked the temperament to excel at number four. The middle-order was one of the reasons why India bowed out of the World Cup at the semifinal stage.
With India struggling to find a reliable number four, celebrated coach Dav Whatmore opines Shubman Gill can solve the problem. Whatmore rightly said that India failed to solve their middle-order woes. At the same time, he also had some words of praise for the Men in Blue’s performance in the World Cup.
“The No. 4 issue kept raising its head. India should look at the future. Shubman Gill is a fantastic young batsman and he could well fill that slot. He’s got the technique,” Whatmore was quoted as saying by Sportstar.
“India had a good tournament. It topped the group after nine matches, made runs, had a very good bowling attack, both pace and spin. But India ran into New Zealand in the semifinal, and the Kiwis made full use of helpful conditions. It’s just one defeat in a World Cup semifinal that can happen to any team. New Zealand did too much damage in the first 10 overs. India has got some powerful stroke makers and a potent attack. It should do very well in the coming days,” he added.

Good: Elizabeth Warren on Peter Thiel saying she is 'dangerous'
US politician Elizabeth Warren shared an article on Twitter that revealed PayPal Co-founder Peter Thiel called her the most "dangerous" Democratic presidential candidate and responded saying, "Good." "I think she's the one who's actually talking about the economy, which is the only thing...I think matters by far the most," Thiel said. "All the others are almost equally unimpressive," he added.

Senator Elizabeth Warren  doesn’t seem too unhappy about being labeled “dangerous” by investor Peter Thiel .
Thiel, who co-founded PayPal, Palantir and Founders Fund, made the comments in an interview on Fox News with Tucker Carlson, where he described most of the Democratic presidential field as “equally unimpressive” and called Warren “the dangerous one.”
“I’m most scared by Elizabeth Warren,” he said. “I think she’s the one who’s actually talking about the economy, which is the only thing — the thing that I think matters by far the most.”
Warren tweeted a link to a Bloomberg story about Thiel’s remarks with a succinct response of her own: “Good.”

Thiel is a high-profile backer of libertarian causes and a Trump supporter — a fact that’s made him a controversial figure in Silicon Valley — so it’s hard to imagine that many Democratic primary voters will be following his recommendations. Indeed, to some, Thiel’s criticism could be seen as an endorsement.
During the same interview, Thiel — who sits on Facebook’s board — repeated points made in an earlier speech where he accused Google of “seemingly treasonous” conduct and said the government should investigate the search giant’s ties with China. (China being the main target in Trump’s trade war.)
Warren, who’s been gaining in some recent polls, has some thoughts on tech policy as well, having called for the breakup of Google, Amazon and Facebook and also proposed an equity fund for underrepresented entrepreneurs.

Privacy concerns raised over photo app FaceApp, company responds
The Russian company behind the viral photo-editing app 'FaceApp', that lets users virtually look older, responded to the privacy concerns over the users' photos. "Most images are deleted from our servers within 48 hours," FaceApp said. "We might store an uploaded photo in the cloud...We want to make sure users don't upload the photo repeatedly for every edit," it added.
https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/17/faceapp-responds-to-privacy-concerns/?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts
TechCrunch
FaceApp,  the AI-powered selfie-editing app that’s been having another viral moment of late, has now responded to a privacy controversy that we covered earlier here.
We’ve pasted the company’s full statement at the bottom of this post.
The tl;dr here is that concerns had been raised that FaceApp, a Russian startup, uploads users’ photos to the cloud — without making it clear to them that processing is not going on locally on their device.
Another issue raised by FaceApp users was that the iOS app appears to be overriding settings if a user had denied access to their camera roll, after people reported they could still select and upload a photo — i.e. despite the app not having permission to access their photos.
As we reported earlier, the latter is actually allowed behavior in iOS — which gives users the power to choose to block an app from full camera roll access but select individual photos to upload if they so wish.
This isn’t a conspiracy, though Apple could probably come up with a better way of describing the permission, as we suggested earlier.
On the wider matter of cloud processing of what is, after all, facial data, FaceApp confirms that most of the processing needed to power its app’s beautifying/gender-bending/age-accerating/-defying effects are done in the cloud.
Though it claims it only uploads photos users have specifically selected for editing. Security tests have also not found evidence the app uploads a user’s entire camera roll.
FaceApp goes on to specify that it “might” store the photos users have chosen to upload in the cloud for a short period, claiming this is done for “performance and traffic” — such as to make sure that a user doesn’t repeatedly upload the same photo to carry out another edit.
“Most images are deleted from our servers within 48 hours from the upload date,” it adds.
It also claims no user data is “transferred to Russia”, even though its R&D team is based there. So the suggestion is that storage and cloud processing are being performed using infrastructure based outside Russia. (We’ve asked it to confirm where this is done. Update: Founder Yaroslav Goncharov told us it uses AWS and Google Cloud.)
“We don’t sell or share any user data with any third parties,” it adds.
FaceApp also says users can request their data is deleted. Though it doesn’t yet have a very smooth way to do this — instead it asks users to send delete requests via the mobile app using “Settings->Support->Report a bug” with the word “privacy” in the subject line, adding that it’s “working on a better UI for that”.
It also points out that the vast majority of FaceApp users don’t log in — making the point that it’s not able to link photos to identities in most cases.
Here’s its statement in full:
We are receiving a lot of inquiries regarding our privacy policy and therefore, would like to provide a few points that explain the basics:
1. FaceApp performs most of the photo processing in the cloud. We only upload a photo selected by a user for editing. We never transfer any other images from the phone to the cloud.
2. We might store an uploaded photo in the cloud. The main reason for that is performance and traffic: we want to make sure that the user doesn’t upload the photo repeatedly for every edit operation. Most images are deleted from our servers within 48 hours from the upload date.
3. We accept requests from users for removing all their data from our servers. Our support team is currently overloaded, but these requests have our priority. For the fastest processing, we recommend sending the requests from the FaceApp mobile app using “Settings->Support->Report a bug” with the word “privacy” in the subject line. We are working on the better UI for that.
4. All FaceApp features are available without logging in, and you can log in only from the settings screen. As a result, 99% of users don’t log in; therefore, we don’t have access to any data that could identify a person.
5. We don’t sell or share any user data with any third parties.
6. Even though the core R&D team is located in Russia, the user data is not transferred to Russia.
Additionally, we’d like to comment on one of the most common concerns: all pictures from the gallery are uploaded to our servers after a user grants access to the photos (for example, https://twitter.com/joshuanozzi/status/1150961777548701696).  We don’t do that. We upload only a photo selected for editing. You can quickly check this with any of network sniffing tools available on the internet.

Kerala IPS officer Merin Joseph brings child rape accused from Saudi
A team led by Kollam Police Commissioner Merin Joseph arrested a man accused of raping a 13-year-old Kerala girl from Saudi Arabia and brought him to India on Tuesday. The accused, a Kollam native who works in Saudi Arabia, allegedly raped his friend's niece for three months in 2017. The child and her uncle later committed suicide.

The News Minute
On Sunday, Kollam Police Commissioner Merin Joseph IPS and her team left to Riyadh in Saudi Arabia. Merin was unsure of the procedures that would follow once she landed in Riyadh, but one thing she was sure of, she would return to India with Sunil Kumar Bhadran (38), a man wanted in a child rape case.
Sunil Kumar, a native of Kollam, was a tile worker in Saudi Arabia. In 2017, while he was holidaying in Kerala, he sexually assaulted his friend’s niece for three months. 
The 13-year-old girl, who belonged to a scheduled caste community, was devastated and finally revealed her ordeal to her family. By the time the police issued a lookout notice, Sunil had fled to Saudi Arabia.  The girl was later moved to Government Mahila Mandiram rescue home at Karicode in Kollam district. However, she killed herself in June 2017. Before this, the victim’s paternal uncle who had introduced Sunil Kumar to the family had also killed himself.
Merin, who took charge as the Kollam Commissioner in June 2019, had reviewed pending cases, with an emphasis on cases related to women and children.
“I found this case and got to know that this man was absconding for almost two years. This was a case that had impacted public conscience and people were outraged at the crime. The International Investigation Agency of the Kerala police had been following up with Saudi police, we just strengthened these efforts,” she explains.
Though an Interpol notice had been issued for Sunil Kumar in 2017, the case had never progressed. Many cases don’t progress though Interpol notices are issued, as it required continuous follow-up and  co-operation from the other country involved.
In 2010, then  Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and Saudi King Abdulla had signed the India- Saudi extradition treaty. Despite many Keralites who were wanted in cases in the state having fled to Saudi, no extradition has happened till now. A few days ago, the Kerala police was informed that Saudi police had Sunil in custody. Though most IPS officers would have sent junior officers to secure the man, Merin chose to go herself. 
“This was the first time that we would be doing such an extradition. I wanted to learn how it works so that I could, in turn, share the knowledge with my team. There was a lot of paperwork, it involved the CBI and the Interpol too. We also had to make documents to bring him back. This is why I decided to go. I am also passionate about cases involving women and children, and this was a man I believed should be brought back to face trial," she told TNM.
Sunil Kumar Bhadran has now become the first person to be extradited for a crime committed in Kerala. And this, will perhaps pave the way for many more criminals seeking refuge in Saudi to be brought back.

The News Minute
Officials are often seen engrossed in files in government offices in India but employees at a government office in Telangana surprised everyone and amused some, by filming and sharing TikTok videos.
Singing, dancing and playing pranks, employees of the Khammam Municipal Corporation (KMC) recorded the videos using TikTok app and uploaded them on the video sharing platform.
The videos featuring the employees, with film songs and dialogues playing in the background, were shot in the office during office hours. The videos went viral on social media.
Taking a serious note of this, the KMC cracked the whip on Tuesday by transferring the employees and also reducing their wages.
The issue even reached Khammam Collector R V Karnan through the media as Telugu channels found the videos and aired them.
According to KMC officials, 11 outsourced employees were found involved in the activity and all of them were shifted to other departments. KMC Commissioner J Srinivasa Rao said they were also punished by having their wages reduced.
The incident saw mixed reactions on social media as some appreciated the videos and said that it was just a little harmless fun at work, while others criticised the government officials for seemingly ignoring their duties.
The salaries of the employees who were transferred were also reduced. Some of them were in clerical positions, while others were involved in field work. They seem to have many such TikTok videos, many of whose screenshots are being shared on social media.
The videos themselves are not recent, but were found to be shot about two months ago, a senior official from KMC told PTI. The administration only came to know about the employees shooting the videos when they appeared in the media, and then issued a stern warning against such activities.

Trump reacts to Mumbai attacks mastermind Hafiz Saeed's arrest in Pak
US President Donald Trump on Wednesday reacted to Jamaat-ud-Dawa chief and 26/11 Mumbai terror attacks mastermind Hafiz Saeed's arrest in Pakistan. "Great pressure has been exerted over the last two years to find him!" Trump said about Saeed in a tweet. Saeed, who's been designated a terrorist by the US, was arrested on terror financing charges.

WASHINGTON: US President Donald Trump on Wednesday welcomed the arrest of JuD chief Hafiz Saeed by Pakistan, saying "great pressure" was exerted over Islamabad in the last two years to find the "mastermind" of the 2008 Mumbai terror attack.
Saeed, a UN designated terrorist whom the US has placed a USD 10 million bounty on, was arrested while he was going to Gujranwala from Lahore on Wednesday morning when he was arrested by the anti-terrorism authorities of the Punjab Province.
Saeed's arrest comes just days ahead of Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan's maiden visit to the US and talks with President Trump who has previously admonished Pakistan for not doing enough to rein in terror groups operating from its soil.
"After a ten year search, the so-called "mastermind" of the Mumbai Terror attacks has been arrested in Pakistan. Great pressure has been exerted over the last two years to find him!" Trump said in a tweet.
Saeed was presented before an Anti-Terrorism Court (ATC) in Gujranwala that sent him on judicial remand for seven days. He was subsequently shifted to Lahore's high-security Kot Lakhpat jail, Pakistani officials said.
Saeed-led Jamaat-ud-Dawa (JuD) is believed to be the front organisation for the LeT which is responsible for carrying out the 2008 Mumbai attacks that killed 166 people, including American nationals. He was listed under UN Security Council Resolution 1267 in December 2008.

US' Ebix to acquire Indian travel company Yatra for ₹2,320 crore
US-based software firm Ebix has agreed to acquire Indian travel services company Yatra through a merger at an enterprise value of $337.8 million (₹2,320 crore). Yatra will become part of Ebix's travel portfolio EbixCash alongside Via and Mercury and will continue to serve customers under the Yatra brand. Ebix has invested nearly $700 million in India through EbixCash since 2017.
https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/17/ebix-yatra-acquisition/?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts
TechCrunch
Atlanta-based software firm Ebix  said today it is acquiring Indian online travel booking company Yatra through a merger deal at an enterprise value of $337.8 million as it looks to strengthen its position in India’s hotel and flight ticketing market.
Once the acquisition has completed, Yatra  will become part of Ebix’s EbixCash (the company’s Indian subsidiary) travel portfolio — which also includes Via and Mumbai-based Mercury — and will continue to serve customers under the Yatra brand, the two companies said. Ebix had invested north of $650 million in businesses in India, one of its key markets today, prior to the deal.
Yatra, which went public in 2016 following a reverse-merger with listed company Terrapin 3 Acquisition Corporation, counts India’s Network18, Reliance Capital, Macquarie Group and Rotation Capital among its shareholders.
Yatra, which posted a revenue of $31.7 million in Q4 2018, has over 800 corporate clients. The acquisition would allow it to pose a bigger challenge to MakeMyTrip, a local player that currently leads the market. It consolidated its market lead in India after buying its competitor Ibibo in 2016. In 2017, MakeMyTrip raised $330 million from Naspers and Ctrip. Thanks to a deal between the two investors earlier this year, China’s Ctrip now owns 49% of MakeMyTrip.
EbixCash, which has over 9,000 employees, posted an operating income of $41.5 million in Q4 2018, with a profit of $8.5 million. Ebix develops software solutions for insurance, financial, e-commerce, e-learning, healthcare and travel industries, and has established over 110,000 distribution outlets and amassed over 8,000 corporate clients.
The combined Yatra-Ebix entity will leverage Yatra’s large and loyal existing customer base, comprehensive service offering and multi-channel platform to take advantage of the dynamic and growing multibillion-dollar opportunity in India, the companies said in a joint statement. Yatra’s shares were up over 17% following today’s announcement in pre-market trading.
Travel has emerged as one of the fastest growing categories in India’s internet economy. In a presentation earlier this year, Yatra said the travel segment is on track to grow to $85 billion by 2022, with online platforms accounting for 45% of all transactions.
The companies said their board of directors have unanimously approved the deal and they expect to close it by the fourth quarter of this year. In a statement, they added, “Assuming a value of $4.90 per Yatra ordinary share, the transaction implies an enterprise value of $337.8 million at the Ebix collar price of $59 per share and post adjustment for indebtedness, working capital, warrants to be converted and minimum cash requirement, a net equity value of $239 million.”
The announcement follows months-long negotiations between the two firms. In March, Ebix offered to buy Yatra for $336 million, adding that it might reduce its offer size if Yatra does not accept the proposal soon enough.
Ebix said it is targeting an EbixCash IPO in the second quarter of next year. “The synergies and the cross-selling opportunities can create tremendous economic value for the shareholders, once the IPO is done,” the companies said.
Ebix owns stake in a number of companies in India. Earlier this year, it acquired 80% controlling stake in on-demand SaaS travel firm Zillious. The U.S.-based company’s Indian subsidiary has also acquired stakes in remittance provider Weizmann, online cab hiring platform AHA Taxis, B2B marketplace Routier, travel business Centrum Direct and e-learning firm Smartclass.
In 2017, Ebix acquired controlling stake in Itz Cash, a firm that offers prepaid cash cards, for over $120 million. It also owns assets in Delhi-based Pearl International Tour & Travels and Mumbai-based Lawson Travels & Tours.
Additionally, Ebix has claimed that it owns about three-quarters of the market share of foreign exchange sales at 32 international airports in India.
In a statement, Dhruv Shringi, co-founder and CEO of Yatra, said, “Becoming a part of Ebix’s EbixCash travel portfolio will enable us to continue on that path. As part of a larger diversified organization with the necessary scale and resources to be a leader in today’s dynamic travel marketplace, we will provide more options and an enhanced experience for our joint customers and will be an even stronger partner to the airline, hotel, car rental and other businesses we work with.”
“We are confident that combining Yatra’s loyal customer base, comprehensive service offering and multi-channel platform with Ebix’s complementary Via and Mercury businesses, will create a leading online travel platform and India’s largest corporate travel platform that will capture growth opportunities and deliver enhanced value to shareholders.”

Indian drugmaker dumped key files in 200L drum in scrapyard: US
A US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) investigator found that India's Strides Pharma Science dumped batch records for US drug products in a 200-litre drum in the scrapyard of its Puducherry plant. Strides, which sells numerous drugs in the US, was also caught attempting to shred quality-control documents. Ibuprofen is among the drugs the company makes at the Puducherry plant.
https://in.reuters.com/article/strides-pharma-regulator/u-s-fda-says-indian-drugmaker-strides-pharma-science-was-shredding-dumping-key-documents-idINKCN1UC0AZ?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts
Reuters
BENGALURU (Reuters) - A U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) investigator discovered that India’s Strides Pharma Science Ltd, which exports to the U.S. market, was shredding drug production, quality and laboratory documents and dumping others in a scrap yard. 
The “uncontrolled destruction” of manufacturing records and the lack of adequate documentation handling at the drugmaker’s factory at Puducherry in southern India, called into question the effectiveness of its quality unit and the integrity and accuracy of its records, the regulator said in a warning letter made public on Tuesday. 
The investigator observed multiple bags of manufacturing documents awaiting shredding and a blue binder including the records of batches of drugs produced for the U.S. market in a 55-gallon drum in the scrap yard, Francis Godwin, director of the FDA's Office of Manufacturing Quality, said in the letter here dated July 1.  
The potential importance of individual documents wasn’t made clear by the FDA. 
Strides, which also has factories in Italy, Kenya and Singapore, produces drugs that treat AIDS, malaria and hepatitis. Its revenue grew 6% in the last fiscal year. 
In the letter to Strides, the FDA didn’t explain whether its inspectors often check scrap yards or shredding rooms for documents, or whether it was acting on some kind of tipoff to do so at the Strides plant. 
In its initial response to the FDA’s findings, Strides said the discarding of the binder was inadvertent. 
The FDA said Strides response was “inadequate” because it did not assess how poor documentation practices affected distributed drug product or how the manufacturer would strengthen its quality unit’s oversight. 
The agency said it found “significant violations” of current good manufacturing practice (CGMP) regulations at the facility. 
Shares of the Bengaluru-based company, which fell as much as 8% to a near one-year low earlier on Wednesday, pared some losses to end 3.4% lower. 
Last month, Aurobindo Pharma Ltd was warned here by the FDA for ignoring impurities in an active ingredient it produced. The Hyderabad-based drugmaker recalled contaminated valsartan in January and in March. 
“CGMP documents in the binder were dated as recently as January 21, 2019: seven days before our inspection. Your quality unit did not review or check these documents prior to disposal,” Godwin said in the letter, addressed to Strides Chief Executive Officer Arun Kumar. 
On July 2, Strides shares slumped after it said it received a warning letter from the U.S. FDA, it did not disclose the content of the letter at that time.  
A Strides spokesman said on Wednesday the company did not have any further comment. 
Strides bought a unit of Vivimed Labs Ltd in January. Vivimed manufactures losartan, a drug that is part of a wider recall in the United States. 
The FDA’s warning letter comes months after several Indian drugmakers, including Sun Pharmaceutical Ltd and Dr.Reddy’s Laboratories Ltd, were named in a U.S. lawsuit against Israeli drugmaker Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd accusing it of conspiring to inflate drug prices and stifle competition for generic drugs.

India’s ace shuttlers PV Sindhu and Kidambi Srikanth on Wednesday progressed to the second round of the $1,250,000 Indonesia Open BWF World Tour Super 1000 tournament after winning their respective opening-round matches. Fifth-seeded Sindhu had to fight it out against Japan’s Aya Ohori as she came from a game behind to win 11-21, 21-15, 21-15 in a match that lasted almost an hour.
In the men’s singles event, world no 9 Kidambi Srikanth found it relatively easy as he went past Japan’s Kenta Nishimoto 21-14, 21-13 in the contest that lasted for 38 minutes.
Earlier on Tuesday, India had a good opening day as two doubles pairs entered the second round of the competition. The men’s doubles pair of Satwiksairaj Rankireddy and Chirag Shetty defeated Goh Sze Fei and Nur Izzuddin 21-19 18-21 21-19 in their opening match.

However, there was a disappointment in the women’s doubles event as Commonwealth Games bronze medallists Ashwini Ponnappa and N. Sikki Reddy went down 20-22, 22-20, 20-22 to Malaysian combination of Vivian Hoo and Yap Cheng Wen.

Expect BJP govt in Karnataka next week: BJP National Gen Secy
BJP National General Secretary P Muralidhar Rao on Wednesday claimed that a BJP government is expected to take charge in Karnataka next week.

Rao added that BJP is confident that the Congress-JDS government would lose the trust vote in the Legislative Assembly on Thursday.

The Financial Express
A BJP government is expected to take charge in Karnataka next week, party national general secretary P Muralidhar Rao claimed Wednesday. He said the BJP was confident that the Congress-JDS government, led by Chief Minister H D Kumaraswamy, would lose the trust vote in the Legislative Assembly on Thursday.
“You can expect,” Rao told PTI when asked if a BJP government is expected to be in place in Karnataka next week.
“We will not shy away from our responsibility,” he added.
The coalition government is in “clear minority” and should go, Rao said.
The Supreme Court earlier on Wednesday directed that the 15 rebel Congress and JD(S) MLAs “ought not” to be compelled to take part in the proceedings of the Assembly, which is slated to decide a confidence motion moved by the state government on Thursday.
It further said Assembly Speaker K R Ramesh Kumar was free to decide on the resignations of the rebel legislators within such time-frame as deemed appropriate by him.
Welcoming the apex court’s direction, Rao said the speaker cannot be “arbitrary” and should take a decision within a reasonable time-frame.
“Since now he (the speaker) has gone beyond a point, at least at this point, there should not be a compelling whip to participate.
“So, in a way, the Supreme Court while accepting speaker’s domain, has created a situation where these MLAs should not be compelled to attend the trust vote. So, whip should not be the factor,” he said.
“So, the Supreme Court in a way has given protection to 15 MLAs while exercising their right. Now, in my view, disqualification (of rebel MLAs) is not possible,” Rao contended.
“The way Supreme Court has given the direction, it is in a way, a guideline for the speaker for the future,” he added.

Crypto exchange Cryptokart shuts down over regulatory uncertainty
Cryptocurrency exchange Cryptokart has decided to shut down its operations after about two years. The RBI had barred banks from serving cryptocurrency exchanges and firms in April 2018. Cryptokart Co-founder Gaurang Poddar said that since this decision, the general interest in cryptocurrency in India has "tanked" and regulatory uncertainty "just makes any long term planning difficult".

Citing a lack of support and regulatory uncertainty to continue its operations in India, another cryptocurrency Cryptokart has closed down.
We’ve decided to shutdown Cryptokart, said the firm’s co-founder Gaurang Poddar said in a LinkedIn post. Poddar, further said that the major reason for shutting down the operation was dwindling general interest in the country.
Since the government is not going to introduce any regulations and leave it grey for a while, planning for the long term is difficult, he added.
Now, Poddar is looking for product management opportunities. Two years old firm was co-founded by Poddar and Mihir Modi.
In April last year, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) had asked all the regulated entities including banks not to provide services to businesses dealing in virtual currencies (cryptocurrencies) like bitcoins.
Then Finance Minister Arun Jaitley, during last year budget, had said that the government currently does not consider cryptocurrencies as legal tender and said that the government will take all measures to eliminate the use of crypto assets in the payment system.
The ruling led to falling down in prices of Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Litecoin and closure of their exchanges in the country. It also resulted in mass layoff from crypto exchanges such as Unocoin.
Cryptokart is the fifth crypto firm to shut its operations. Earlier, Zebpay, Coinome, Coindelat, and Koinex shut down their operations owing to non-favorable moves by the government.
Indian govt has been countering cryptocurrency existence ever since the crypto bubble surfaced in mainstream media.
Last month, social media giant Facebook had announced the launch of its own cryptocurrency Libra. Among the many international markets, it also eyes to exploit Indian market.

NCRB doesn't maintain specific data on lynching cases: MHA
MoS for Home Nityanand Rai on Wednesday said the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) doesn't maintain specific data of lynching incidents in the country. He said this in response to a question on whether mob lynchings have increased in the last six months. "State governments are responsible for prevention, detection and investigation of crimes and for prosecuting criminals," he added.

New Delhi: Mob Lynching again became a topic of discussion today in Rajya Sabha when Ministry of Home Affairs was asked if incidents have increased in the last six months.
The Ministry of Home Affairs said that ‘Police’ and ‘Public Order’ are State subjects under the seventh schedule of the constitution and State Governments are responsible for prevention, detection and investigation of crimes.
Minister of State (Home Affairs) Nityanand Rai, replying to the question of Rajya Sabha, said that the state governments are responsible for prosecuting the criminals through their law enforcement agencies.
“National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) does not maintain specific data with respect to lynching incidents in the country,” said Rai.

On Saturday, Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) chief had demanded a pan-India stringent to curb mob-lynching and said that mob lynching has emerged as a dreadful disease (bhayanak bimari) across the country, and the loss of lives in it is a matter of serious concern.”
Senior Congress Leader Salman Khurshid had opined that the mob lynching atmosphere prevails in small towns and villages in India, and not so much in ‘areas of Delhi, where we live or work’.
Last month, a 24-year-old Muslim man named Tabrez Ansari in Jharkhand died after a mob attacked him and forced him to chant ‘Jai Shri Ram’ over suspicion of theft.

Vakrangee has 3,504 Nextgen Vakrangee Kendra outlets spread across 19 states, with 68% outlets in Tier 5 and Tier 6 cities. Vakrangee plans to increase the number of Nextgen Vakrangee Kendra outlets to 75,000 by FY2021-22 and 3,00,000 outlets by FY2024-25.
"Vakrangee plans to leverage this deep presence by being an enabler for the EV charging facility through its network of retail outlets called as Vakrangee kendras. We continue to focus on expanding the bouquet of services available at our Nextgen Vakrangee Kendras," the company said in a statement.
"For all operators who want to set up electric vehicle services in India, It will make sense for them to leverage our charging infrastructure rather than building one of their own. We are building a large charging footprint on a pan-India basis through our network of Nextgen Vakrangee Kendra outlets," the company added.
Executive chairman Dinesh Nandwana, said: “We believe that the electric vehicle space is a huge growth opportunity for the coming years and we want to be future ready by developing a pan-India footprint of EV charging infrastructure. We would be an enabler by providing the distribution platform for the EV charging facility through our partnership with the EV service providers."
In Budget 2019, the government proposed to provide additional income tax deduction of  ₹1.5 lakh on the interest paid on loans taken to purchase electric vehicles as part of efforts to accelerate adoption of eco-friendly mobility solutions.
Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said the initiative would lead to a benefit of around  ₹2.5 lakh for a customer during the entire duration of the loan.
"Considering our large consumer base, we aim to leapfrog and envision India as a global hub of manufacturing of electric vehicles," she said.
In order to make EVs affordable, the government has already moved the GST council to lower the tax rate on such vehicles from 12 to 5 per cent, the finance minister said.
Incorporated in 1990, Vakrangee is into the business of providing last-mile retail outlets to deliver real-time banking and financial services, ATM, insurance, e-governance, e-commerce and logistics services to the unserved rural, semi-urban and urban markets. The assisted digital convenience stores are called as “Vakrangee Kendra" which acts as the “one-stop shop" for availing various services and products.

Govt may list 5 units of world's top coal miner Coal India
The government may reportedly list units of state-run Coal India (CIL), the world's largest coal miner, as separate companies to raise government funds and boost competition. Reports said the Coal Ministry is studying a proposal to list CIL's four production coalfields, constituting over three-fourths of its output, and its exploration unit.

Who would have won WC final had both teams hit equal boundaries?
If England and New Zealand had hit equal boundaries both in Super Over and the match in World Cup final, a count-back from Super Over's final ball would've decided the winner. The team with the higher scoring delivery would've been declared the winner. England would've won as they hit a four on the last ball, while New Zealand scored one.
https://www.crictracker.com/icc-world-cup-2019-who-wouldve-won-had-the-boundary-count-in-the-final-too-ended-in-a-tie/?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts
CricTracker
The 2019 World Cup final between England and New Zealand came to a rather dramatic end. The encounter at the iconic Lord’s Cricket Ground went down to the Super Over after both teams got tied on 241 runs. Even in the one-over eliminator, the Brits and the Kiwis notched 15 runs. Martin Guptill was run out in the last delivery of the over and the Three Lions won the championship.
It was also England’s maiden World Cup after they qualified for the finals for the first time since 1992 when Imran Khan’s Pakistan defeated them. Eoin Morgan and Co were declared the winners since they had hit more number of boundaries (50 overs plus Super Over). The decision to hand the trophy to England at the Home of Cricket triggered a massive outrage on social media because of the ‘boundary count’.

After the jaw-dropping encounter, Kane Williamson, the Black Caps’ skipper, said that his team didn’t lose the game and there was only one winner. Even as the ICC’s rules remain the same, the question is — what would have happened had the boundary count been the same for both teams?
Rule Number 1: If the number of boundaries in the above case is also equal, in that scenario, boundary scored in the 50 overs played by both teams (Super Over excluded) would have been counted.
Rule Number 2: In a rare scenario, even if after applying the above two scenarios, the count is still equal, in that case, a count-back would have been taken from the final balls faced by both teams in the Super Over and the side with the higher scoring delivery would have won.
For example, if both teams faced six balls in the Super Over, where one side scored four runs off the final ball and the other side scored six off their final delivery, the second side would have been the winner. Whichever was the last delivery faced by two teams in the Super Over (in case if a team lost 2 wickets and had faced just 4 balls in Super Over) would have been taken into account and the team that scored more runs off its final delivery would have lifted the trophy.

MS Dhoni's parents want him to retire: Childhood coach Banerjee
Team India wicketkeeper-batsman MS Dhoni's childhood coach Keshav Banerjee has revealed that the former India captain's parents want their son to retire from international cricket. "Dhoni's parents told me that the entire media is saying that Dhoni should retire and they feel that the media is right. They said they can't handle their big property alone anymore," he added.

Over the last few days, there has been a lot of commotion surrounding MS Dhoni’s retirement from international cricket. The veteran, who turned 38 on July 7, recently plied his trade the World Cup, which India couldn’t win and bowed out following the semi-final defeat. The Men in Blue’s next series is versus the Windies and it’s not confirmed whether Dhoni will be a part of the fixtures or not.
It has recently been learned that the wicketkeeper may not remain an automatic choice and chief selector MSK Prasad will have a word with him on the matter. Even as Dhoni has been a recipient of extreme criticism of later, a number of eminent personalities including the likes of lyricist Javed Akhtar and singer Lata Mangeshkar, spoke in his favour. Dhoni has also been backed by skipper Virat Kohli.

Amidst all the hullaballoo regarding Dhoni’s position in the team, his parents don’t wish for their son to continue as India can’t handle the ‘big property’ anymore. Keshav Banerjee, his childhood coach from Ranchi, visited Dhoni’s family at their home on Sunday where they discussed the matter.
“Dhoni’s parents told me that the entire media is saying that he should retire, and we feel they’re right. They said we can’t handle this big property anymore,” Banerjee was quoted as saying in Sports Tak.
He asked them to hold their patience for one more year. “You’ve handled it for so long – around 10 to 12 years. You can do it another year,” he added. Banerjee also told Dhoni’s parents that the experienced campaigner should play until the 2020 edition of the T20 World Cup in Australia, which is scheduled to get underway on October 18.
Dhoni had a topsy-turvy run the World Cup 2019. He could only manage 273 runs in eight innings. He got the top score of 56* versus the Windies. In the semis against New Zealand at the Old Trafford in Manchester, he scored a half-century and kept his team alive. However, Martin Guptill pulled off a thunderous direct hit to run Dhoni out and also seal the fate of the encounter.

Woke up wondering if it was a bad dream: Williamson on World Cup final
Reacting to losing World Cup final on boundaries to England, New Zealand captain Kane Williamson said, "I woke up wondering if it was just a bad dream and it wasn't, was it?"

CricTracker
It was a heartbreaking loss for New Zealand in the World Cup 2019. A tie-breaker couldn’t break the tie in this humdinger of a game. Ultimately, England was declared the winner since they hit the more number of boundaries in the match. New Zealand’s skipper Kane Williamson still seems to have not gotten over the defeat and said he thought if it was a bad dream when he woke up the next day.
There were several factors which snatched the World Cup away from New Zealand. Some umpiring blunders, some serious misfortune and a few bad moves cost them dearly. It isn’t easy for any team to lose two World Cup finals in a row but nevertheless, it was an undeniably incredible final. The Kiwi players are still sinking in this bitter truth and can’t believe how fate played them. James Neesham seemed absolutely dejected and even came up with an emotional tweet after the loss.

Kane Williamson compared New Zealand’s loss to a ‘bad dream’ and spoke about how he’s been tackling with it in an interview with ESPNCricinfo. The Kiwi skipper spoke about the mixture of emotions after this loss. He still seemed to be bewildered with whatever has happened and is finding it hard to believe it.
“I sort of explained it to a few people, it’s like sort of hits you in waves. You feel like, 10 minutes, you forget about it and then you make little jokes and then it comes back to you and you go… ‘that just happened’ and ‘did that just happen’. ‘Is that real’. I woke up wondering if it was just a bad dream and it wasn’t, was it?” Williamson was quoted as saying.

NIA (Amendment) Bill passed in Rajya Sabha amid doubts by Opposition
The Rajya Sabha has passed the National Investigation Agency (Amendment) Bill, 2019. Although the bill was passed unanimously, the Opposition raised doubts over its possible misuse. Union Home Minister Amit Shah said, "I assure the House that the bill will not be misused...Both Houses need to prove to the world and the terrorists that we are united in this fight."
https://www.livemint.com/politics/policy/rajya-sabha-passes-controversial-nia-bill-1563366811299.html?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts
Livemint
NEW DELHI: In a big push for India’s national security, the Rajya Sabha on Wednesday unanimously passed the National Investigation Agency (Amendment) Bill, 2019.
The bill’s uncontested passage in the Upper House marks a sharp change from the discussions in the Lok Sabha on Monday, when the government and the Opposition sparred over the validity of the proposed amendments in the bill and how far the proposed law will be able to check terrorism.
Eventually, there were six voices of dissent in the Lok Sabha, and none in the Rajya Sabha.
While Opposition parties raised doubts over the possible misuse of the bill, Union home minister Amit Shah told the Rajya Sabha: “I assure the House that the bill will not be misused under any circumstances. If the country does not vouch for the efficiency of the NIA, how will it hold any standing globally? Both Houses need to prove to the world and the terrorists that we are united in this fight."
Shah added that the proposed amendments would further empower the country to fight terror—as was evident in the fact that out of the 195 cases with the agency since 2014, chargesheets had been filed in 129 cases, with 41 convictions.
Minister of state for home affairs G. Kishen Reddy told the House that since the inception of the NIA in 2009 to 2014, the agency had registered 80 cases, out of which judgement was passed in 38 cases, while 36 cases resulted in convictions. Reddy however, added that since Prime Minister Narendra Modi had assumed office in 2014, the agency had registered 195 cases—a huge jump from the United Progressive Alliance (UPA) government’s numbers.
The Congress party, while reaffirming its stand for strengthening national security, pointed out gaps in the proposed amendments, reiterating that none of the major cases—such as the Samjhauta Express blast, Ajmer Dargah bombing, Malegaon blast and the Sohrabuddin encounter case – had reached a conclusive end.
“Section 4 of the amendment adds that the agency wants to go abroad and conduct investigations as they do in India. First of all, they don’t have the treaties to catch any person abroad without going through the local police force. Have you heard of that happening in India? So, in practical effect, they will have zero power, but they will show India that they have done something great," said senior Congress leader and member of Parliament (MP) Abhishek Manu Singhvi.
The bill now awaits President Ramnath Kovind’s nod.
The NIA was set up in 2009 following the 26/11 Mumbai terror attacks by Pakistan-based Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT), which killed 166 people.
On Monday, the Lok Sabha passed the bill with the Opposition red flagging concerns over the potential misuse of the proposed law against certain communities.
The bill was passed with 278 members in favour of it, while six members opposed it.
The bill proposes three major amendments to the NIA Bill of 2008. The first focuses on providing the NIA with more teeth to investigate cases pertaining to human trafficking, counterfeit currency, manufacture or sale of prohibited arms, cyber-terrorism, and offences under the Explosive Substances Act, 1908.
The bill also seeks to expand the agency’s jurisdiction to investigate offences committed outside India, such as the Easter day bombings in Sri Lanka.
Finally, it proposes to allow the central government to constitute special courts for NIA trials.
As of now, the NIA is designated to probe cases of terrorism within the country. With the amendments cleared by both Houses of Parliament, the NIA will be able to probe cases of cybercrime and human trafficking as well.
The amendment is significant as the agency has been closely tracking the development of Islamic State (IS) modules in the country, especially in the wake of the Easter Day bombings in Sri Lanka.

Mexican drug lord 'El Chapo' sentenced to life in prison in US
Mexican drug lord Joaquín 'El Chapo' Guzmán was on Wednesday sentenced to life in prison plus 30 years, in the US. The 62-year-old was convicted in February on all 10 counts he faced, including drug trafficking, money laundering and engaging in murder conspiracies. He was earlier ordered to forfeit $12.6 billion (over ₹86,700 crore).

Reuters
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Joaquin “El Chapo” Guzman, the Mexican drug lord who twice escaped maximum-security prisons in that country, will spend the rest of his life in a U.S. penitentiary, a federal judge said on Wednesday after accusing him of “overwhelming evil.” 
Guzman, 62, berated the U.S. justice system, and a former associate described how he had paid a gang $1 million to try to kill her before U.S. District Judge Brian Cogan imposed the mandatory sentence of life plus 30 years.  
Cogan also ordered Guzman to forfeit $12.6 billion in a hearing in federal court in Brooklyn.  
The judge said that even if the law had allowed him any leeway, he would have imposed the harshest sentence available, adding that any redeeming qualities Guzman might have were erased by his “overwhelming evil” actions. 
A jury in February convicted Guzman of trafficking tons of cocaine, heroin and marijuana and engaging in multiple murder conspiracies as a top leader of the Sinaloa Cartel, long known as one of Mexico’s largest, most violent drug trafficking organizations. 
Guzman, whose nickname means “Shorty,” developed a reputation as a Robin Hood-like figure that made him a folk hero to many in his home state of Sinaloa, where he was born in a poor mountain village. 
He has been held in solitary confinement in the Metropolitan Correctional Center, a fortress-like jail in lower Manhattan. Cogan last month rejected Guzman’s request for more time to exercise on the jail’s roof, after prosecutors said that would risk an escape. 
Guzman, who recently grew a mustache, complained about the terms of his confinement before his sentence was handed down. 
“It has been psychological, emotional, mental torture 24 hours a day,” said Guzman. He alleged that the jurors on his case allowed media accounts of the trial to influence their thinking - an argument his lawyers have also made. 
“Since the government of the United States is going to send me to a prison where my name will not ever be heard again, I take advantage of this opportunity to say there was no justice here,” he told the court. 
Before he was finally captured in 2016, Guzman twice escaped maximum-security prisons in Mexico. He was extradited to the United States to face trial in January 2017. 
“Never again will Guzman pour poison over our border, making billions while innocent lives are lost to drug violence and addiction,” U.S. Attorney Richard Donoghue told a news conference outside the Brooklyn courthouse. “We can ensure that he spends every minute of every day of the rest of his life in prison.”  
Guzman made a name for himself as a trafficker in the 1980s by digging tunnels under the U.S.-Mexico border that allowed him to smuggle drugs more quickly than his rivals. He amassed power during the 1990s and 2000s through often-bloody wars with rivals, eventually becoming the Sinaloa Cartel’s best-known leader. 
His 11-week trial, which featured testimony from more than a dozen former associates who had made deals to cooperate with prosecutors, offered an unprecedented look at the cartel’s inner workings. 
Andrea Velez, a former associate of Guzman, said on Wednesday that Guzman had paid the Hell’s Angels motorcycle gang $1 million to have her killed, and that she had escaped with the help of U.S. authorities. 
“I confess that I sinned, but I paid a high price for my faults,” Velez said of her work with the cartel. 
The trial witnesses, who included some of Guzman’s top lieutenants, a communications engineer and a onetime mistress, described how he built a sophisticated organization resembling a multinational corporation. 
He sent drugs northward with fleets of planes and boats, and had detailed accounting ledgers and an encrypted electronic communication system run through secret computer servers in Canada, witnesses said. 
U.S. prosecutors have claimed that Guzman sold more than $12 billion worth of drugs, and Forbes magazine once listed him as one of the world’s richest men. 
Guzman often lived on the run. Imprisoned in Mexico in 1993, he escaped in 2001 hidden in a laundry cart and spent the following years moving from one hideout to another in the mountains of Sinaloa, guarded by a private army. 
He was seized again in 2014, but pulled off his best known escape the following year when he disappeared into a ventilated, mile-long (1.6-km) tunnel dug into his cell in a maximum-security prison. 
He was finally recaptured in January 2016. The Mexican government says he blew his cover through a series of slip-ups, including an attempt to make a movie about his life. 
Guzman’s lawyers have said they intend to appeal his guilty verdict, citing a report that jurors disobeyed court rules by reading news reports about the case during the trial. 
Despite Guzman’s downfall, the Sinaloa Cartel had the biggest U.S. distribution presence of Mexican cartels as of last year, followed by the fast-growing Jalisco New Generation Cartel, according to the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration.

International Monetary Fund (IMF) chief Christine Lagarde on Tuesday announced that she would leave the global crisis lender on September 12. Lagarde has held the top role at the IMF since 2011 and is in line to succeed European Central Bank President Mario Draghi in November. A former French finance minister, Lagarde was the first woman to head the IMF.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - International Monetary Fund chief Christine Lagarde submitted her resignation from the global crisis lender on Tuesday, citing more clarity about her nomination to lead the European Central Bank as European legislators approved a new top bureaucrat. 
Lagarde said in a statement her resignation was effective Sept. 12, firing the starting gun for the IMF’s search for her successor, which is likely to be another European. 
“With greater clarity now on the process for my nomination as ECB President and the time it will take, I have made this decision in the best interest of the Fund,” Lagarde said in a statement. 
She said her resignation would expedite the selection for the next head of the IMF. 
IMF succession is expected to be a major topic of discussion among G7 finance ministers and central bank governors meeting on Wednesday and Thursday in Chantilly, France, near Paris amid concerns that slowing global growth and trade conflicts will pressure vulnerable economies. 
Lagarde’s resignation, first reported by Reuters, came two weeks after her nomination on July 2 for the ECB’s top job. She did not immediately quit the IMF because of uncertainty over whether the new European Parliament would support her and other new EU leadership positions, sources told Reuters. 
Her nomination was part of a package of top officials agreed by EU governments that included German Defense Minister Ursula von der Leyen as European Commission president, who drew Green party opposition. 
Later on Tuesday, von der Leyen was approved by the European Parliament in a 383-327 vote.   
The European parliament will hold a nonbinding vote on Lagarde’s appointment, which is expected to be finalized by EU leaders at a regular summit on Oct. 17-18. 
Since its creation at the end of World War Two, the IMF has been led by a European, while its sister institution, the World Bank, has been led by an American. Analysts say the “duopoly” is likely to continue after U.S. President Donald Trump’s nominee, David Malpass, was approved in April to lead the World Bank with European support.  
Finance leaders of Europe’s four largest economies — Germany, France, Britain and Italy — will participate in the G7 finance meeting this week in Chantilly, along with other large IMF shareholders the United States, Japan and Canada, giving weight to discussions on IMF leadership.  
On the sidelines of the G7 meeting, Bank of England Governor Mark Carney, considered a leading candidate to replace Lagarde, is slated to meet with U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, who wields strong influence over the IMF’s leadership. 
The United States holds an effective veto over major Fund decisions, with a 16.52 percent share of its voting power. 
While Carney, 54, is a Canadian economist, he holds Irish and British passports and has led Britain’s central bank since 2013 and chaired the Financial Stability Board, an international body, for seven years.   
Other names being floated include Bank of Finland Governor Olli Rehn, as well as ECB executive board member Benoit Coeure. 
Kristalina Georgieva, a Bulgarian national who is currently chief executive officer of the World Bank, has been seen as having an outside chance, according to some IMF sources. 
Two IMF board sources said there was concern among some IMF member countries that the Fund’s IMF leadership would be left in limbo due to the long ECB confirmation process, and it was better for her to resign to accelerate the succession process. 
The IMF’s acting managing director, David Lipton, said earlier on Tuesday that the fund would adapt to Lagarde’s departure as it has other developments over 75 years. 
A former French finance minister, Lagarde was the first woman to head the IMF and was known among policymakers as a tough negotiator. She was a tireless advocate for the benefits of trade, global growth that aids the poor and middle classes, and the empowerment of women. 
Her second five-year term as head of the IMF was not due to end until July 2021. Traditionally, the post has always been held by a European, while the head of the IMF’s sister organization, the World Bank, has always been an American since the institutions were created at the end of World War Two.  
If approved, Lagarde would take over as ECB president from Mario Draghi on Oct. 31. While her confirmation could be lengthy, it is likely to be largely a formality as long as the euro zone’s biggest member states - Germany, France and Italy - are in unity. 
Her immediate challenge at the ECB would be to overcome her shortcomings in monetary policy-making, especially as it seeks to rearm for a potential new slump after years of using unconventional policy tools to stimulate inflation and growth. 
As head of the IMF, she has had some battle-testing, bringing stability to the euro zone debt crisis of the last decade and presiding over large bailouts for Argentina, Egypt and Ukraine. She has emphasized the need for the IMF to maintain its $1 trillion in lending firepower to deal with any future crises.

Tata India's most valued brand at $19.6 bn, LIC next at $7.3 bn
The brand 'Tata' has again been ranked as India's most valuable brand in 2019, according to a report by London-based consultancy Brand Finance. Tata's brand value rose 37% from last year to $19.6 billion, surpassing the combined value of the second and third most valued brands in India, LIC ($7.3 billion) and Infosys ($6.5 billion), respectively.
https://www.livemint.com/companies/news/tata-pips-lic-to-become-india-s-most-valuable-brand-in-2019-1563355922166.html?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts
Livemint
The brand "Tata" has become India’s most valuable brand for the second straight year in 2019, according to the Brand Finance India 100 2019 report.
Tata’s brand value rose 37% to $19.6 billion as compared to $14.2 billion in 2018, surpassing the combined value of the second and third most valued brands in India. The second most valued brand this year was the government-owned Life Insurance Corporation of India (LIC) at $7.3 billion and a close third was Infosys at $6.5 billion.
“Being recognised as India’s most valuable and fastest growing brand is a matter of pride for us," said Harish Bhat, brand custodian at Tata Sons.
“This is testament to the Tata brand’s strong inherent value, reflecting the trust consumers and stakeholders have placed in us. As we move ahead, our people-first approach, industry leading technologies, expertise and strategic investments will further strengthen our brand," he added.
The annual report on Indian brands was published by a London-based independent branded business valuation and strategy consultant, Brand Finance. The firm calculates the value of brands in its league tables using the ‘royalty relief approach’, which estimates likely future sales that are attributable to a brand based on the royalty rate that would be charged for its use.
The royalty rate is calculated by the firm and then used to arrive at a ‘brand value’ that is equivalent to the net economic benefit that a licensor would derive by licensing the brand in the open market.
“Tata Group is to be commended for its ability to scale new heights, as it is not only India’s most valuable brand, but has also recorded faster growth than any other brand in the top 25, with an impressive 37% increase," said David Haigh, chief executive officer of Brand Finance.
“The group’s brand presence across autos, IT services, steel and chemicals continues to go from strength to strength and remains a force to be reckoned with," he added.
Every year, Brand Finance values 5,000 of the world’s biggest brands. The 100 most valuable Indian brands are included in the ‘Brand Finance India 100 2019’ ranking.
The report also ranks brands based on their strength, which is understood as the efficacy of a brand’s performance on intangible measures relative to its competitors. This year, Mukesh Ambani-owned Reliance Jio emerged as the "strongest" Indian brand, followed by HDFC Bank and Indian Oil Corporation Ltd.

Bloomberg Quint
(Bloomberg) -- Twitter and Square Chief Executive Officer Jack Dorsey addressed Apple Inc. employees at the iPhone maker’s headquarters Tuesday, a signal of the strong ties between the Silicon Valley giants.
Dorsey, who co-founded Twitter Inc. and Square Inc., is one of several speakers talking to select Apple employees as part of an ongoing series, people familiar with the matter said. The billionaire spoke with staff from the marketing department, they said, asking not to be identified discussing internal matters.
While the address itself didn’t point to a new partnership between Dorsey’s companies and Apple, it was indicative of their bond and existing collaboration. Apple promoted Twitter as an iOS app coming to the Mac this fall, and the social media service is deeply integrated into both the iPhone and iPad. Apple was also among the first retailers to sell Square’s now-common credit-card reader.  
Apple and Twitter representatives declined to comment.

Co-working space provider Awfis is raising Rs 90 crore ($13.24 million) from Bisque Ltd and Link Investment Trust. The funding round, which is a mix of equity and convertible debt, has come after its $20 million Series C round in July last year.
Bisque will be investing about Rs 88.65 crore while Link Investment Trust will pour in Rs 1.35 crore. About Rs 71.91 crore would come in the form of compulsorily convertible debt. Remaining Rs 18 crore would be a pure-play equity investment, reveals RoC filings with MCA.
Awfis is backed by Sequoia Capital, The Three Sisters: Institutional Office run by Yes Bank Founder and MD, Rana Kapoor and venture debt provider Innoven Capital. The company caters to SMEs, startups, and corporations. 
According to a CNBC report, about 40% revenue of the firm comes from corporates along with 20% from startups and freelancers.
Currently, Awfis is serving to about 1500 companies, and 19,000 plus professionals. Vodafone, Hinduja Group, Duff & Phelps and Michelin Tyres are some of the notable clients of the company. The Delhi-based company was reportedly in talks with private equity firm ChrysCapital to raise $25 million equity investment.
So far, Awfis had raised over $50 million in a mix of equity and debt financing rounds.
Awfis had clocked a nearly three-fold jump in revenue during FY19 at Rs 158 crore from Rs 56 crore in the preceding fiscal on the back of rising demand for shared office space. It’s targeting a projected revenue of Rs 300 crore by the end of the ongoing fiscal.
The firm competes with BHIVE, Innov8, 91springboard, Stirring Minds, and others. Importantly, OYO had entered the co-working business with the acquisition of Innov8. The SoftBank-backed venture also had launched two separate brands Powerstation and WorkFlo.

The New Indian Express
BELAGAVI: After consuming the midday meal at school, 81 students of Government Higher Primary School of Vantamuri, near Belagavi, were rushed to the district hospital with complaints of health problems on Tuesday afternoon.
According to sources, a dead lizard was found in a container used to cook the meal for children, and all of them started complaining of health issues after having their meal.
A Belagavi-based NGO supplies midday meals to the government school in Vantamuri. The food was served on Tuesday during the lunch break.
A teacher found a dead lizard in the rice container in the kitchen and immediately asked students to stop eating. By that time, a large number of students had already eaten most of their meal.
Panicked students and teachers took the help of villagers to rush all the students to the primary health centre in Vantamuri, and from there, they were brought to the district hospital.
After treatment, 69 students were discharged without any complications, while 12 others who had consumed more food, have been kept under observation for a day in the hospital.
On receiving the information, Belagavi Tahsildar Manjula Naik, DDPI A B Pundalik, district health officer Dr S V Munyal, rural block education officer Leelawati Hiremath, rural ACP Balachandra Shingyagol and other officers visited the district hospital. 
Parents demand action against NGO 
The parents of the affected students expressed anger over the incident and demanded action against the NGO which failed to take measures to ensure supply of hygienic food to the children.
Speaking to reporters, DHO Dr S V Munyal said the students were paranoid after the commotion broke out in the village.
They are all stable without any health problems, he said. The food samples have been sent to the laboratory for testing, he said.  
Belagavi rural block education officer Leelavati Hiremath said, “Midday meals are supplied to this school by an NGO.
A lizard was found in the rice while distributing meals to students, and the staff stopped distributing and brought the students to the district hospital in an ambulance.
Now all students are out of danger. A report will be sent to higher officials to take action against the guilty, she added.

Australia urges China to let Uighur mother and son leave country
The Australian government has called on China to let an ethnic Uighur mother and son to leave the country. Sadam Abdusalam, an Uighur-Australian, has made a public call for the release of his wife and son, whom he has never met. China is believed to have held nearly 10 lakh Uighur Muslims in detention camps in the Xinjiang province.

Sadam Abdusalam has been campaigning for months so his Uighur wife and their son can come to Australia
Australia's government on Wednesday called on China to allow an Australian child and his Uighur mother to leave the country, days after co-signing a letter denouncing Beijing's treatment of the Muslim minority.
China has rounded up an estimated one million Uighurs and other mostly Muslim Turkic-speaking minorities into re-education camps in tightly controlled Xinjiang region, in the country's northwest.
Sadam Abdusalam has campaigned for months for his Uighur wife, Nadila Wumaier, and their son Lutifeier, whom he has never met, to be allowed to come to Australia.
Australia's embassy has "formally requested that the Chinese authorities allow Ms Wumaier and her son (who is an Australian citizen) to travel to Australia", Foreign Minister Marise Payne said Wednesday.
The statement came after Abdusalam, an Australian citizen, shared his plight publicly for the first time during a documentary on the Xinjiang camps aired Monday on national broadcaster ABC.
He told AFP that his wife was taken in for questioning by Chinese authorities the following day, but was later released.
Payne said that she was aware of the reports that Wumaier was interrogated, but added that diplomats had no consular access rights as she was not an Australian citizen.
China's foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said at a regular press briefing in Beijing on Wednesday that he had not seen the Australian statement.
"If the Australian side provides China with detailed relevant information through bilateral channels, China will provide the necessary assistance," he said.
Canberra had initially denied citizenship to Lutifeier, who was born in Xinjiang in August 2017, but backtracked last year following a legal battle.
Foreign Minister Marise Payne said Canberra has formally asked China to allow Nadila Wumaier and Lutifeier to come to Australia
Abdusalam said he was "really happy" that Australia was taking action, but called on officials to do more.
"I'm going to keep trying to keep pressure on China and keep pressure on the Australian government," he told AFP.
"On 31 August he will be two years old," Abdusalam said of Lutifeier.
"I would like to see my son before 31 August so we can celebrate his birthday as a family."
Australian lawyers representing the family are urging Canberra to fast-track a visa for Wumaier.
"Bringing this family together safely is the goal," Marque Lawyers wrote on Twitter.
- Escalating tensions -
Canberra has traditionally been keen to avoid friction with its biggest trading partner, but tensions between the two countries have escalated over security concerns and Beijing's growing presence in the Pacific.
Australia was among 22 countries, along with Britain, Canada and Japan, that last week wrote to top United Nations officials condemning China's treatment of ethnic minorities.
Beijing downplays the camps as "vocational education centres" aimed at steering people away from religious extremism through job training, Mandarin lessons and law classes.
It has blocked Australian diplomats from visiting Xinjiang since early 2017 and said Monday's ABC programme on the facilities was "full of lies, distortion and bias".

Jet Airways lenders to reopen bids to sell airline: Reports
The lenders of grounded Jet Airways, led by SBI, will reportedly reopen bids to sell the carrier on July 20 to recover about ₹8,500 crore it owes to them. The candidates will likely be shortlisted by early August, reports said. The banks are also reportedly considering a nearly ₹70-crore interim infusion to pay some employee and legal costs, among others.

Reuters
NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Lenders to Jet Airways will open bids to sell the bankrupt airline on July 20, as they look to recover about 85 billion rupees ($1.24 billion) of loans, two sources familiar with the matter said on Tuesday. 
Last month, Jet’s creditors, led by State Bank of India (SBI), took the airline to the bankruptcy court after failing to agree on a revival plan. 
The airline, grounded since April 17, was admitted to the Mumbai bench of the National Company Law Tribunal on June 20. 
Since then, the court has directed the bankruptcy resolution firm Grant Thornton, which liaises with creditors on behalf of the bankrupt firm, to complete the recovery process within 90 days instead of the 180 days that is typically awarded.  
The bankers are also considering a request to provide interim funding of $10 million to pay some employee, legal, compliance, operational and maintenance costs, among other things, said one of the sources, who was present at the first meeting of the core committee of creditors (COCA). 
The Expression of Interest window to gauge buyer interest in the airline will open next Saturday and candidates should be shortlisted by early August, according to one of the sources. 
An SBI-led consortium of 26 banks has informed the resolution professionals that Jet Airways owes them about 85 billion rupees, added the banker. Apart from this, it also owes over 4 billion rupees to employees in unpaid salaries.

I lost 26 kg as I had no appetite for first 4 months: Rishi on cancer
Speaking about battling cancer, Rishi Kapoor revealed, "I had lost 26 kg as I had no appetite for the first four months. Now, I've gained 7-8 kg." Rishi, who has been undergoing treatment in New York, added, "It's been nine months and 16 days...I really miss home." The actor further said he is hoping to return to India by August-end.

Times Now
Rishi Kapoor made headlines last year after the veteran actor went to New York with his wife Neetu Kapoor for getting treated for his medical condition (unknown at the time). Soon after rumours were abuzz that the actor was actually suffering from cancer. In has been close to a year now and while it has been reported that the actor is now ‘cancer-free’, he is still at the same medical facility he was at, receiving post-cancer care. It was also revealed recently that Rishi Kapoor will finally be able to come back home at the end of August this year.
In a recent interview with a tabloid, Rishi Kapoor poured his heart out about battling the devastating disease and the struggles he had to go through in the last one year. Incidentally, in the beginning, the veteran actor had lost 26 kg of his weight because he didn’t have an appetite and couldn’t eat anything. However, Rishi has confirmed that the phase is more or less over, emphasising that he has gained 8 kg since his recovery.
“On the subject of my health, thanks to the prayers and good wishes of my family, friends and fans, I am perfect now. The cancer is in remission, but I am still under treatment. I have a crucial meeting with the doctors today at 10.45 am, there’s one treatment still left to be done. The problem is not the treatment but the reaction time. The problem is not the treatment but the reaction time. There is a six-week gap between one treatment and the next when all you can do is eat, shop, watch movies, live a normal life which I would rather do at home than here in New York. It’s been nine months and 16 days—I know since I have been counting the days—that I have been away. I really miss home,” Rishi Kapoor revealed.









 
While Rishi Kapoor didn’t want to indulge in describing the disease he battled for close to a year, the veteran actor did reveal details about his post-cancer treatment. Rishi discussed the process underway and the timeline of his treatment following which he will return home at the end of next month.
“I have to be here for 11 months, so I will not be back before the end of August. It’s been a difficult time, very taxing, but Neetu (wife), and my children (Ranbir and Riddhima) have been very supportive. I am grateful to everyone. I am waiting to come back and raring to get going. I will plan my return five-six weeks after my last treatment. It is called consolidation or pushback, whereby I will have to undergo chemotherapy to ensure that the ailment does not return. This is the second time I am going through the treatment. I am hoping that I can plan an end-August return but all this talk that I will be back in early September for my birthday, is again nothing but speculation.” – excerpt from the interview.












Over the last few months, several Bollywood celebs and prominent personalities have visited the Bollywood veteran at the Sloan Kettering Hospital in New York. Deepika Padukone, Shah Rukh Khan, Aamir Khan, Karan Johar, Manish Malhotra, Boman Irani, Arjun Kapoor, Malaika Arora, Priyanka Chopra, Abhishek Bachchan, Aishwarya Rai Bachchan, Kapil Dev, Rajkummar Hirani, Vicky Kaushal and several other celebs have visited the actor. Even the Ambanis – Mukesh and Nita Ambani and Anil and Tina Ambani have met Rishi Kapoor and Neetu Kapoor in the Big Apple.

Magnificent desolation: 2nd man to step on Moon recalls experience
The second man to walk on the Moon, Buzz Aldrin, talking about his experience on the 50th anniversary of Apollo 11 Moon mission's rocket launch, recalled his description of the lunar surface as "magnificent desolation". The now 89-year-old astronaut said it was his "greatest good fortune" to have joined Neil Armstrong and pilot Michael Collins on the Saturn V rocket.
https://www.reuters.com/article/us-space-exploration-aldrin/buzz-aldrin-second-man-on-moon-recalls-magnificent-desolation-idUSKCN1UC01P?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts
Reuters
LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Fifty years after their history-making voyage to the moon, Buzz Aldrin recalls the first moments of the Apollo 11 launch being so smooth that he and his two crewmates, Neil Armstrong and Mike Collins, were unsure precisely when they left the ground.  
He remembers the white-knuckle descent to the moon’s dusty surface in the four-legged lunar module Eagle, as Armstrong took manual control of the landing craft to pilot it to a safe touchdown, just seconds from running out of fuel. 
And as the second human ever to step on the moon - Armstrong was first down the ladder - Aldrin recounts feeling sure-footed in the one-sixth gravity of the lunar surface while gazing at the “magnificent desolation” around him. 
Aldrin says he and his crewmates were so absorbed in doing their jobs that they were oddly disconnected from how momentous the occasion was as it unfolded for hundreds of millions of people on Earth, watching it all on live television. 
“I sometimes think the three of us missed ‘the big event’,” Aldrin said during a 50th anniversary gala at the Ronald Reagan Library outside Los Angeles. “While we were out there on the moon, the world was growing closer together, right here.” 
Aldrin, now 89 and one of just four living people ever to have walked on the moon, recounted highlights of his Apollo 11 experiences in an interview with an organizer of Saturday’s event, which was closed to the media. A transcript was furnished to Reuters. 
It was 50 years ago to the day on Tuesday that Aldrin, Armstrong and Collins were launched into space atop a Saturn 5 rocket from Florida’s Kennedy Space Center.  
“We did not know the instant of leaving the ground. We only knew it from the instruments and voice communications which confirmed liftoff,” he recalled. “We sort of looked at each other and thought, ‘We must be on our way.’” 
After reaching lunar orbit, leaving Collins behind as pilot of the command module Columbia, Armstrong and Aldrin descended to the moon’s surface in the Eagle. Armstrong ended up piloting the craft to a safe landing after overriding a computer guidance system that was heading it to a field of boulders. 
During those tense moments, Aldrin’s voice was heard in the TV broadcast calling out navigation data as Eagle moved downward and forward over the surface to touchdown. 
“We knew we were continuing to burn fuel. We knew what we had, then we heard ‘30 seconds left.’ If we ran out of fuel, we knew it would be a hard landing. We saw the shadow cast in front of us. That was new, not something we saw in the simulator,” Aldrin recounted. 
“I saw dust creating a haze, not particles, but a haze that went out, dust the engine was picking up,” he said.  
In the final seconds of descent, Aldrin confirmed an indicator light showing that at least one of the probes dangling from Eagle’s footpads had touched the surface - calling out “Contact light.” 
Seconds later came Armstrong’s famed radio announcement to mission control in Houston - “Houston, Tranquility Base here. The Eagle has landed.” 
The relief of the two astronauts was mutual. “Neil remembers we shook hands, and I recall putting my hand on his shoulder and we smiled,” Aldrin said.  
Hours later, Armstrong’s words upon becoming the first human to set foot on the moon - “That’s one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind” - were immortalized. As Aldrin recalls, “Neil thought of that. It wasn’t on the checklist.” 
Aldrin’s turn came next. 
“I then got in position to come down ... came down the ladder, and jumped off, being careful not to lock the door behind me,” he said, recounting “it was easy to balance” as he moved about the lunar surface to set up NASA experiments. 
To this day, Aldrin added, he stands by his own best known, though somewhat less famous catch phrase from the moon - his impromptu description of the moonscape as a scene of “magnificent desolation.” 
“I guess I said that because it was magnificent,” he said. “We had gotten there, and it looked pretty desolate. But it was magnificent desolation. I think Neil remarked the beauty, too.”

If not in schools, kids should be given eggs at home: Chhattisgarh
The Congress-led Chhattisgarh government has said that if some parents are against serving eggs in mid-day meals in schools, authorities should make arrangements to serve them to non-vegetarian children at their homes. It added that separate seating arrangements should be made for students who don't consume eggs, and they should also be served alternatives like soya milk and fortified biscuits.
http://www.newindianexpress.com/nation/2019/jul/17/chhattisgarh-mid-day-meals-eggs-to-be-provided-at-home-if-vegetarian-parents-oppose-2004897.html?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts
The New Indian Express
RAIPUR: The Chhattisgarh government said Tuesday that if some parents oppose serving eggs in mid-day meals at the school, authorities should arrange to serve eggs to the students whose families have no objection at home.
The instruction came after there was opposition to the Congress government's proposal to serve eggs in mid-day meals at government schools.
The school education department in January this year had suggested including eggs or milk or other food item with equivalent nutrition value in the mid-day meal twice a week.
A clarification was issued Tuesday, asking district collectors to hold a meeting of the Shala Vikas Samiti and the parents within two weeks, where the students who do not want eggs in the mid-day meal would be identified.
Eggs should be cooked separately, and while serving meals, separate sitting arrangement should be made for vegetarian students, it said.
Vegetarian students should be provided soya milk, protein crunch, fortified biscuits, fortified soya-badis or cooked fortified pulses as an alternative, it said.
But if there is no agreement on serving eggs (if vegetarian parents do not want eggs served at the school at all), then the concerned Shala Vikas Samiti should devise a system to serve eggs to students (who want to eat them) at their homes, the department added.
Members of the Kabir Panthi sect had recently staged a protest demanding that eggs be removed from the mid-day meal menu, saying their children study at government schools and eggs were against their ethos.
Opposition BJP and Janata Congress Chhattisgarh (J) raised the issue in the state assembly Monday, asking the government to respect the sentiments of the Kabir Panthis.
Congress MLAs defended the decision saying eggs would help prevent malnourishment among children in tribal and other backward areas.

I don't have a racist bone in my body: Trump
US President Donald Trump said on Tuesday that he does not have a "racist bone" in his body. The US President has been accused of racism over his recent remarks on four US Congresswomen, who are all minorities. Trump had said that the women should "go back" to the "broken and crime-infested" countries they "came from".
https://www.rt.com/usa/464333-trump-tweet-not-racist-bone/?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts
RT
The president tweeted his rebuke on Tuesday, on the heels of reports that House Democrats would vote on a resolution to condemn his remarks as a “blatant racist attack,” later in the afternoon.
Those Tweets were NOT Racist. I don’t have a Racist bone in my body!
The Democrat-led House resolution will condemn the president’s remarks – which singled out Representatives Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Ilhan Omar, Rashida Tlaib and Ayana Pressley – as “racist comments” which legitimize “fear and hatred of new Americans.”

The bill’s primary sponsor, Congressman Tom Malinowski (D-New Jersey), said he expects it will garner support across the aisle. If passed, the measure would be a largely symbolic rebuke of the president’s more restrictive, ‘closed borders’ stance on immigration.

Will identify, deport infiltrators from every inch of India: Shah
Home Minister Amit Shah said that the government will identify illegal immigrants and infiltrators living in every inch of this country and deport them as per the international law. Shah's comment came during a debate over the NRC in the Rajya Sabha. Shah said the people elected the BJP as it promised action against illegal immigrants in its poll manifesto.

Times Now
 
New Delhi: Home Minister Amit Shah, on Wednesday, said the government would identify illegal immigrants and infiltrators living on every inch of the country and deport them.
Speaking during the Question Hour in Rajya Sabha, Shah, who is also Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) president, said, "We will identify all the illegal immigrants and infiltrators living in every inch of this country and deport them as per the international law."
Prime Minister Narendra Modi-led central government has often come under fire over its stand on immigrants.
Earlier this month, TMC MP Mahua Moitra said that people, who have been living in the country for the past 50 years, are being thrown out of their homes and are being called illegal immigrants. "People who have lived in this country for 50 years must show a piece of paper to prove they are Indians," she had said in Parliament earlier this month. 
Shah's statement comes a day after the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) said that the Centre has adopted a multi-pronged approach to ensure effective surveillance and domination of international borders to check infiltration of illegal migrants.
The MHA, in a written reply to BJP MP Parvesh Sahib Singh in Lok Sabha, said, "Physical infrastructure like border fencing, floodlighting, construction of border roads and establishment of border outposts has been created."
"Vulnerable border outposts are regularly reviewed and strengthened by deploying additional manpower, special surveillance equipments and other force multipliers. A technological solution in the form of Comprehensive Integrated Border Management System (CIBMS) has been implemented in some vulnerable border areas," the ministry added.
Asserting that detection and deportation of illegal immigrants is a continuous and ongoing process, the MHA further told the Lok Sabha that border guarding forces regularly conduct patrolling, lay nakas and establish observation posts and carry out anti-tunnelling exercises to stop illegal infiltration. 
The ministry also underscored that the Central Government has also issued advisories to the state governments and Union territories administrations regarding the identification of illegal migrants and monitoring thereof.
It further said that to deal with illegal immigrants, the "powers of the Central Government under Section 3 of The Foreigners Act, 1946 to detect, detain and deport illegal foreign nationals and powers under Section 5 of The Passport (Entry into India) Act, 1920 to remove an illegal foreigner by force have been entrusted under Article 258(1) of the Constitution of India to all the state governments."

The Delhi High Court on Wednesday granted two weeks' time to Robert Vadra to file his reply to the Enforcement Directorate's plea against his anticipatory bail. The court has listed the matter for further hearing on September 26. Earlier today, Vadra's counsel sought more time for responding stating that Vadra was outside India when the notice was served to him.

The New Indian Express
NEW DELHI: Robert Vadra Wednesday sought more time in the Delhi High Court to file his response to the Enforcement Directorate's plea challenging his anticipatory bail in a money laundering case.
Justice Chander Shekhar granted two weeks' time to Vadra, brother-in-law of Rahul Gandhi, to file his reply to the plea seeking cancellation of the anticipatory bail and listed the matter for further hearing on September 26.
Vadra's counsel said he was outside India when the court's notice on the petition was served on him and he has returned on July 11.
Vadra is facing allegations of money laundering in the purchase of a London-based property at 12, Bryanston Square, worth 1.9 million pounds.
The case is being probed under the provisions of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act.
The ED, in its plea, has challenged a trial court's April 1 order, which granted Vadra anticipatory bail.
The probe agency has sought to cancel the anticipatory bail on grounds that it required his custody as he was not cooperating in the investigation.
The high court had earlier also sought the response of Manoj Arora, an employee of Vadra's Skylight Hospitality LLP and co-accused in the case, on the agency's plea seeking cancellation of the anticipatory bail.
The plea, filed through ED prosecutor DP Singh, has challenged the trial court's order, saying the special judge had failed to consider the settled position of the law that bail should not be "granted in a routine manner".
The ED has contended that if Vadra is granted the blanket protection of bail, there is a likelihood that he may tamper with evidence and influence the witnesses in the case and that the trial court had failed to appreciate that he was a highly-influential person.
It has claimed that Vadra was "non-cooperative" and in spite of being given several opportunities to come clean on his alleged role in the case, he remained evasive.
It said the protection given to him would be detrimental to its probe into certain crucial aspects, including ascertaining the exact source of the allegedly tainted money and the end use of the funds involved in the case.
Besides, the ED has alleged that Arora was aware of the undeclared overseas assets and was instrumental in arranging funds.
The separate pleas of Vadra and Arora seeking quashing of the case are also pending before the high court.
They have denied the allegations.
The ED further said that Vadra has "maliciously" claimed to be a victim of political vendetta and made all possible attempts to sensationalise the case.
It said the other important aspects of the probe are related to unearthing the entire source of credits for purchasing the properties and ascertaining the details of all similar transactions in the accounts of the entities concerned.
The trial court, while granting anticipatory bail to Vadra, had directed him not to leave the country without prior permission and also to join the probe as and when called by the investigating officer.
According to the ED, it had lodged the money-laundering case against Arora after his role came up during the probe of another case filed by the Income Tax Department under the newly-enacted Black Money Act and tax laws against absconding arms dealer Sanjay Bhandari.
It has alleged that the London-based property was bought by Bhandari for 1.9 million pounds and sold in 2010 for the same amount, despite incurring an additional expense of approximately 65,900 pounds on its renovation.
ED said it has received information about various new properties in London which allegedly belong to Vadra, including two houses worth 4-5 million pounds each and six flats.

The Financial Express
With over 150 anti-poaching camps in the Kaziranga National Park affected by the Assam floods, the authorities are working round-the-clock to check poaching at the UNESCO World Heritage site, officials said. The staff and security personnel are performing their duties using mechanised and country boats to deal with any kind of eventualities, they said. Ninety per cent of the Kaziranga National Park in Golaghat and Nagaon districts of the state was still submerged, a statement from the Assam Ministry of Forest and Environment said.
Besides forest guards, a State Disaster Relief Force (SDRF) team was engaged alongside Assam Police personnel in vulnerable spots of the park, Divisional Forest Officer, Kaziranga National Park (KNP), Rohini Ballab Saikia said The press communique said 155 of the 199 anti-poaching camps at the KNP are affected by floodwaters. The Kaziranga National Park is home to the world’s largest population of Indian one-horned rhinoceroses. Other animals such as tigers, elephants, sloth bears, monkeys and musk deer are also found in the forest.
Some of the animals have taken shelter in highlands within the park and many are migrating to the southern highlands of Karbi Anglong, crossing National Highway 37, the statement said. Though 90 per cent of the KNP is submerged, water level inside the park and the adjoining NH-37 has receded to some extent, restoring the movement of heavy vehicles on the highway on Tuesday.
However, passenger buses were not being allowed to drive through the park, Saikia said. Till now, six accidents have been reported on the national highway, causing the death of five Hog Deer and a Sambar, the communique said. Five other animals in the park are reported to have succumbed to injuries “for various reasons due to flood”, it said. “Teams for rescue operation of distressed animal, as per necessity, are kept in readiness. The Special Rhino Protection Force is also deployed in vulnerable locations of the park,” the communique said.
Meanwhile, on the directions of Chief Minister Sarbananda Sonowal, Minister of State for Environment and Forests Naba Kumar Doley has rushed to the park to oversee measures being taken to ensure the safety of wild animals, it said. Principal Chief Conservator of Forests and Head of Forest Force A M Singh visited several areas of the park to take stock of the situation.
Another Principal Chief Conservator of Forests and Chief Wildlife Warden, Ranjana Gupta, is camping in the park to supervise the operations. Flood and rescue operation management is being monitored by the chief minister and the forest minister, the release said. Both of them are in constant touch with the park authority for real-time analysis and support, it added.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi had on Monday spoken to Chief Minister Sonowal to take stock of the flood situation, including the condition of the KNP, and assured all possible help and support.

European Commission elects its first female President
Germany's Ursula von der Leyen was elected as the first female President of the European Commission by the European Parliament on Tuesday. Von der Leyen has resigned from the post of Germany's Defence Minister to take over the new role at the European Union's executive body. She will succeed Jean-Claude Juncker who is set to step down on October 31.
https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jul/16/ursula-von-der-leyen-elected-first-female-european-commission-president?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts
The Guardian
Ursula von der Leyen has been confirmed as the European commission’s first female president and the first German in the job for more than 50 years.
In a secret ballot, MEPs voted narrowly to support the German defence minister as a replacement for Jean-Claude Juncker when he steps down on 31 October.
She won the support of 383 MEPs, nine votes more than required to secure an absolute majority but below the 400 threshold that would have given her a stable majority to get her policies through parliament over the next five years.
She will take over from Juncker on the day that Boris Johnson, who is likely to be the next British prime minister, has said he will take the UK out of the EU with or without a deal.
Von der Leyen said she would be open to Brexit being delayed further “for a good reason” although she insisted the withdrawal agreement would not be renegotiated.
After the announcement of the result, she said: “The trust you place in me is confidence you place in Europe. Confidence in a united and strong Europe, from east to west, from south to north. The confidence in a Europe that is ready to fight for the future rather than fight against each other.”
Asked whether she would prefer Johnson or Jeremy Hunt to become the next British prime minister, she told reporters: “I do not know [either] of them personally and there is a golden rule which I respect that I will work in a very constructive way with every head of state and government.”
The president is proposed by the European parliament and nominated by the European council of leaders of the EU member states. They lead the commission's work in implementing EU policies, chair the weekly commission meetings and set its policy agenda. They also represent the EU at European council meetings, G7 and G20 summits and at bilateral summits with third countries.
The role was held by Jean-Claude Juncker from November 2014 until July 2019, when he was replaced by Ursula von der Leyen, the former German defence minister.
Von der Leyen’s emergence as EU leaders’ choice for the post two weeks ago had come as an unwelcome surprise to the Socialists and Democrats group, and even to some in the centre-right European People’s party (EPP) of which she is a member.
She had been nominated by the leaders after 50 hours of arduous negotiations despite not being one of the spitzenkandidats, or lead candidates, who campaigned before May’s European elections to head the EU’s executive branch.
Juncker’s appointment to the job in 2014, as the first spitzenkandidat, whose position relied on a the EPP’s emergence in the elections as the biggest group, had been seen as an important transfer of power away from EU capitals to the European parliament.
But opposition to Von der Leyen’s candidacy appeared to melt away after a 30-minute speech on Tuesday morning in which she made a series of left-leaning pledges to win over the socialists and stressed the importance of her being the first woman to be nominated by the heads of state and government.
“Exactly 40 years ago, the first president of the European parliament, Simone Veil, was elected and presented her vision of a united Europe,” Von der Leyen said. “It is thanks to you, and to all the other European icons, that I present to you today my vision of Europe. And 40 years later, it is with great pride that it is finally a woman who is the presidential candidate of the European commission.”
Veil, a survivor of the Holocaust who became only the fourth woman to be buried in the Panthéon in Paris after her death last year, was one of France’s most revered politicians, known for her battle as health minister to legalise contraception and abortion.
Von der Leyen committed in her speech to ensuring full gender equality among the 28 commissioners that she would lead in Brussels.
“If member states do not propose enough female commissioners, I will not hesitate to ask for new names,” she said. “Since 1958 there have been 183 commissioners. Only 35 were women. That is less than 20%.”
She went on to commit to establishing a pan-EU guarantee of free healthcare and education for every child. “I know as a mother of seven that it makes a difference for their entire life if children have access to education, sports, music, healthy food and to a loving environment”, she said.
In policies designed to win over the socialists, she pledged to establish an EU-wide minimum wage, a fund to prop up national welfare systems in the case of an economic crisis and to ensure flexibility in the tax and spend restraints on eurozone countries.
She also committed to a far-reaching environmental programme, including a “green deal”, offering billions of euros in investment and a new EU carbon border tax, with the aim of achieving carbon neutrality on the continent by 2050.
Ursula von der Leyen, born in 1958, is the daughter of Heidi and Ernst Albrecht, the latter having been a senior politician in the centre-right Christian Democratic Union who rose to be governor of the state of Lower Saxony.
She spent the first 12 years of her life in Brussels, where her father was serving as a commission official. She studied economics at the universities of Göttingen and Münster before attending the London School of Economics where she used the pseudonym Rose Ladson because she was seen as a potential target for West German leftwing extremists.
Von der Leyen then read for a medical degree, becoming a gynaecologist, and only entered politics at 42. A mother of seven, she has held government positions as labour and family affairs minister, driving forward key policies on gender quotas for company boards and improved maternity and paternity pay and rights – policies that initially won her considerable popularity.
In 2011, Von der Leyen spoke of her desire for a “United States of Europe along the lines of federal states like Switzerland, Germany or the US”. She has since claimed that Brexit, and the loss of the “pragmatism” of the British in the EU, should propel the bloc towards further integration, and has voiced support for a European army.
She is a key ally of Angela Merkel, with whom she has worked since 2005. Like Merkel, she has championed the idea of a close relationship between the EU and UK after Brexit.
Von der Leyen, though, has been withering about those who campaigned for Brexit, Describing events since the referendum as a “burst bubble of hollow promises … inflated by populists”. She has cautioned that a no-deal Brexit would be the “worst possible start” to the close long-term EU-UK relationship that Berlin holds desirable.
The nicknames she has acquired over the course of her 29-year career in German politics tell their own story. During her time in charge of the family ministry, she was first called Krippen-Ursel (“crèche Ursel”), a conservative closet feminist set on expanding nursery places, and then Zensursula, a control freak who wanted to shield German youth from the dark sides of the internet.
When she became Germany’s first female defence minister in 2013, her (mostly male) detractors referred to her as Flinten-Uschi (“shotgun Uschi”), a caricature of the bossy career woman.
As commission president, Von der Leyen will represent the EU on the world stage, and a key task will be building a working relationship with Donald Trump’s White House. She has previously criticised a lack of strategy in Trump’s approach to Vladimir Putin’s Russia and has suggested the US president’s frosty relationship with Merkel is based on his outdated view of women.
Daniel Boffey in Brussels and Philip Oltermann in Berlin
In her biggest cross-party promise to MEPs, she said she would allow the parliament the right to propose legislation.
“Anyone who wishes to help Europe will find in me a passionate fighter by their side,” she said. “Anyone seeking to split and destroy our values will find a fierce opponent.”
Iratxe García, the Spanish leader of the Socialists and Democrats group, said: “We were very sceptical when the candidate came to our group last week, but over the past days we have to admit that she embraced our group’s core demands, with specific proposals for legislation.”
The leader of the liberal Renew Europe group, Dacian Cioloș, said he expected that fewer than five of his 108 MEPs had voted against Von der Leyen, who spoke in fluent English, French and German during the debate in parliament.
Cioloș said he had also received assurances that his fellow liberal Margrethe Vestager, a former Danish finance minister who is currently the commissioner for competition, would be appointed as an executive vice-president on an equal footing with the socialist group’s Frans Timmermans.
Representatives from the governing parties in Hungary and Poland criticised Von der Leyen’s pledge to continue with the commission’s attempt to block or reverse judicial changes in their countries.
“Lady Justice is blind – she will defend the rule of law wherever it is attacked,” Von der Leyen had told the parliament.
Green MEPs were among the 327 MEPs who voted against her candidacy. Their co-chairman Ska Keller said there had not been enough “green content” to her proposed green deal.
Von der Leyen, a close ally of Angela Merkel, becomes the first German commission president since Walter Hallstein served from 1958 to 1967.
Martin Selmayr, the commission’s German secretary general, has said he will leave his post next week. The convention is that the two top posts in the EU executive are not held by nationals of the same member state.

Stokes asked umpires to not award 4 overthrows in final, they ignored
England pacer James Anderson has revealed what all-rounder Ben Stokes requested umpires after the ball deflected off his bat and England got four overthrows in World Cup final's last over. "Stokes...said, 'Can you take that four runs off. We don't want it'," Anderson said. The umpires ignored the request because it was a four as per rules, Anderson added.

CricTracker
England won the World Cup for the first time on Sunday by defeating New Zealand on the basis of the boundary count. Many are criticising the ICC rules which decided the winner, the game had changed in the last over of the chase when the ball deflected off Ben Stokes’ bat to go for four overthrow runs. It led to the hosts coming back in the contest and having a realistic chance of winning the trophy. The game eventually ended in a tie and clearly, the overthrow runs helped England.
However, England’s Test pacer James Anderson has now revealed that Stokes had asked the umpire overturn the overthrow decision which would’ve cost them the World Cup. If at all, the on-field had obliged to Stokes’ request, the equation would’ve come down to seven runs off the last two balls.

The game-changing moment is being talked all over the world and Ben Stokes apologised to New Zealand skipper Kane Williamson soon after the incident. But the all-rounder’s gesture of asking to overturn the decision should win a lot of hearts.
“The etiquette in cricket is if the ball is thrown at the stumps and it hits you and goes into a gap in the field you don’t run. But if it goes to the boundary, in the rules it’s four and you can’t do anything about it. I think, talking to Michael Vaughan who saw him after the game, Ben Stokes actually went to the umpires and said, ‘Can you take that four runs off. We don’t want it’,” James Anderson said while speaking on the BBC’s Tailenders podcast.
Anderson also praised Stokes for having the presence of mind to ask the umpire not to add those four runs to England’s total. “But it’s in the rules and that’s the way it is. It’s been talked about for a while among the players, potentially that being a dead ball if it does hit the batsman and veer off somewhere.
“It was truly an incredible question to ask of the umpires, considering the gravity of the situation and the fact it would have left England struggling to force a tie after 50 overs of batting,” Anderson further added.

You could've squeezed in: Brad to Leonardo on 'Titanic' door scene
Brad Pitt trolled his co-star Leonardo DiCaprio during an interview while promoting their upcoming film 'Once Upon A Time In Hollywood'. When the host asked if Jack, Leonardo's character, could have fit on the floating door in the scene towards the end of 'Titanic', Brad said, "You could've [squeezed in there], couldn't you?" Responding to this, Leonardo said, "No comment".

Leonardo DiCaprio's Once Upon a Time in Hollywood co-stars Brad Pitt and Margot Robbie amusingly weighed in on his Titanic raft controversy.
Fans have often debated whether the 44-year-old Oscar winner's character Jack could've fit on the floating wreckage, which spared the life of Kate Winslet's Rose from the 1997 hit film.
'Could you, could you have squeezed in there? You could've, couldn't you?' Pitt needled his grinning castmate during an MTV News interview posted Monday.

Titanic director James Cameron has argued that it's not a question of whether there was room for Jack, it's a question of buoyancy.
'When Jack puts Rose on the raft, then he tries to get on the raft - he's not an idiot, he doesn't want to die - and the raft sinks; and it kind of flips,' the 64-year-old Oscar winner told IGN back in 2012.
'So it's clear that there's really only enough buoyancy available for one person. So he makes the decision to let her be that person instead of taking them both down. If you know anything about hypothermia, the more you're submerged... and she's completely out of the water on the raft.
'It's only [a couple inches] above the surface. If he got on with her, they'd both be half in and half out of the water. Even if they could balance on it and they would've both died.'

Google gaining unchecked power: 2nd protest walkout organiser quits
Meredith Whittaker, one of seven Google employees who organised mass walkouts in November 2018 against the handling of sexual misconduct complaints, has quit after 13 years. "Google, in the conventional pursuit of quarterly earnings, is gaining significant and largely unchecked power," Whittaker wrote. This comes weeks after another walkout organiser Claire Stapleton quit Google in June.
https://www.engadget.com/2019/07/16/google-protest-organizer-quits/?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts
Engadget
One of the leaders of a mass walkout last year in protest of Google's handling of sexual misconduct cases has left the company, Bloomberg reports. Meredith Whittaker was the founder of Google's Open Research Group and served with AI Now, an ethics organization which criticizes the use of technology in areas like policing and surveillance.
Last November, Whittaker and six colleagues organized a walkout after it emerged that Google paid large sums to executives who were accused of sexual harassment. The protesters demanded an end to forced arbitration in harassment and discrimination cases and greater transparency over pay and job opportunities.
Whittaker said that she experienced retaliation after organizing the November protest and was told that her role would be "changed dramatically." Another of the protest organizers, Claire Stapleton was told she would be demoted and subsequently left the company as well. There were further accusations of reprisals at Google's town hall meeting in April.
Whittaker also previously spoke out against Google's involvement in Project Maven, an AI for the US Department of Defense which analyzed drone footage.
Chris Lu, a software engineer at Google, criticized the company's treatment of Whittaker in a tweet, saying "Watching her experience as a whistleblower at Google and a victim of retaliation cannot signal good things for how AI institutions will react to negative criticism. #NotOkGoogle"

Musk's Neuralink unveils 'threads' that link brains to computers
Elon Musk has unveiled his new startup Neuralink's flexible "threads" designed to be inserted in brains to link them directly to computers. Musk said Neuralink, in the long term, is about finding a way to "achieve a sort of symbiosis with artificial intelligence." "We hope to have this in a human patient by the end of next year," Musk added.
https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/16/elon-musks-neuralink-looks-to-begin-outfitting-human-brains-with-faster-input-and-output-starting-next-year/?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts
TechCrunch
Neuralink,  the Elon Musk-led startup that the multi-entrepreneur founded in 2017, is working on technology that’s based around “threads,” which it says can be implanted in human brains with much less potential impact to the surrounding brain tissue versus what’s currently used for today’s brain-computer interfaces. “Most people don’t realize, we can solve that with a chip,” Musk said to kick off Neuralink’s event, talking about some of the brain disorders and issues the company hopes to solve.
Musk also said that, long-term, Neuralink really is about figuring out a way to “achieve a sort of symbiosis with artificial intelligence.” He went on to say, “This is not a mandatory thing. This is something you can choose to have if you want.”
For now, however, the aim is medical, and the plan is to use a robot that Neuralink has created that operates somewhat like a “sewing machine” to implant this threads, which are incredibly thin (like, between 4 and 6 μm, which means about one-third the diameter of the thinnest human hair), deep within a person’s brain tissue, where it will be capable of performing both read and write operations at very high data volume.
All of this sounds incredibly far-fetched, and to some extent it still is: Neuralink’s scientists told The New York Times in a briefing on Monday that the company has a “long way to go” before it can get anywhere near offering a commercial service. The main reason for breaking cover and talking more freely about what they’re working on, the paper reported, is that they’ll be better able to work out in the open and publish papers, which is definitely an easier mode of operation for something that requires as much connection with the academic and research community as this.

Neuralink co-founder and president Max Hodak told the NYT that he’s optimistic Neuralink’s tech could theoretically see use somewhat soon in medical use, including potential applications enabling amputees to regain mobility via use of prosthetics and reversing vision, hearing or other sensory deficiencies. It’s hoping to actually begin working with human test subjects as early as next year, in fact, including via possible collaboration with neurosurgeons at Stanford and other institutions.
The current incarnation of Neuralink’s tech would involve drilling actual holes into a subject’s skull in order to insert the ultra thin threads, but future iterations will shift to using lasers instead to create tiny holes that are much less invasive and essentially not felt by a patient, Hodak told the paper. Working on humans next year with something that meets this description for a relatively new company might seem improbable, but Neuralink did demonstrate its technology used on a laboratory rat this week, with performance levels that exceed today’s systems in terms of data transfer. The data from the rat was gathered via a USB-C port in its head, and it provided about 10x more than what the best current sensors can offer, according to Bloomberg.
Neurlalink’s advances versus current BCI methods also include the combined thinness and flexibility of the “threads” used, but one scientist wondered about their longevity when exposed to the brain, which contains a salt mix fluid that can damage and ultimately degrade plastics over time. The plan is also that the electrodes implanted in the brain will be able to communicate wirelessly with chips outside the brain, providing real-time monitoring with unprecedented freedom of motion, without any external wires or connections.
Elon Musk  is bankrolling the majority of this endeavor as well as acting as its CEO, with $100 million of the $158 million it has raised so far coming from the SpaceX and Tesla CEO. It has 90 employees, and still seems to be hiring aggressively based on its minimal website (which basically only contains job ads). Elon Musk also noted at the outset of today’s presentation that the main reason for the event was in fact to recruit new talent.

BJP councillor beats health inspector, Udupi CMC staff go on strike

US, Pune-based tech startup Icertis now unicorn with $115 mn funding
Washington and Pune-based technology startup Icertis has become a unicorn (achieved billion-dollar valuation) after raising $115 million in an advanced-stage funding round co-led by Greycroft Partners LLC and Wipro's Azim Premji's PremjiInvest. Existing investors including B Capital Group and Cross Creek Advisors participated. Founded in 2009, Icertis helps businesses manage contracts in the cloud.

Bengaluru: Azim Premji has helped create India’s latest tech unicorn: a fast-rising software startup that symbolizes the growing investor interest in the Asian nation’s enterprise technology space.
Icertis, which competes with SAP SE and Oracle Corp. to help businesses manage contracts in the cloud, has raised $115 million, propelling it to unicorn status as investors flock to enterprise software makers.
The advanced-stage funding round in Bellevue, Washington and Pune, India-based Icertis was co-led by Greycroft Partners LLC and PremjiInvest, the fund managed by the family office of Azim Premji. Existing investors including B Capital Group and Cross Creek Advisors participated. With this, Icertis has raised over $211 million.
The enterprise software segment is heating up as investors from Tiger Global Management to Sequoia and Accel scour the industry for India’s next startup giants. Many are expected to be business- rather than consumer-focused, as the country’s talent pool shifts from IT outsourcing services for global clients toward designing and providing online software.
Icertis said it now helps customers worldwide manage over 5.7 million contracts, from supply chain and procurement deals to employee agreements and nondisclosure pacts, that have a total value of more than $1 trillion.
“As contracts get converted from static documents to digital assets for the first time in history, every dollar in or out is governed by a contract, putting them at the heart of every enterprise," said Samir Bodas, Icertis’s co-founder and chief executive officer. “Every global company faces unprecedented global competition and needs software to manage contracts."
Icertis is currently valued at “well north of one billion dollars," Bodas added. The company will use the additional funding to grow its business, including by expanding sales and marketing. Global compliance demands involving Brexit, tariffs, European data privacy regulations as well as rapid digitization has worked in Icertis’s favor, while technologies like artificial intelligence helped enhance the sophistry of its services.
“We have been able to ride the technology wave and assert leadership in the space despite large competitors," Bodas said, citing consultancies Forrester Research and Gartner.
Icertis works on a subscription model, charging customers based on the number of contracts drawn up and tracked using its software. MGI Research forecasts the total spending by companies for such contract management at over $20 billion from 2018 to 2022, with services on the cloud growing around 37% annually over the same period.
Founded in 2009 when Bodas and friend Monish Darda began exploring cloud-based applications, Icertis in 2015 homed in on building a contract management platform. Today, more than 600 of its 850 employees are based in Pune, where the product is developed. The startup operates a dozen offices from Sofia to Sydney.

Fake Ferraris, Lamborghinis being sold for ₹41 lakh seized in Brazil
Brazilian police have shut down a factory that was producing fake Ferraris and Lamborghinis and have arrested a father-son duo who ran it. Police said the cars were being offered on social media for $45,000-$60,000 (approximately ₹31 lakh-₹41 lakh). Eight partially finished vehicles were seized in the raid, and police said they are investigating how many were made.
https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jul/17/police-in-brazil-shut-down-factory-making-fake-ferraris-and-lamborghinis?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts
The Guardian
After receiving the tip-off, it did not take investigators long to find what they described as a “clandestine luxury car factory” manufacturing fake Ferraris and Lamborghinis in the south of Brazil.
The workshop, Autos Fibra, advertised on Instagram and even had a YouTube channel, while disgruntled customers had posted reviews on a local consumer website.
On Monday, police in Itajaí, a seaside city of 215,000 people in Santa Catarina state, raided a garage where they found eight vehicles – two “Ferraris” and six “Lamborghinis” – in various states of completion, the detective Angelo Fragelli told the Guardian. “Some were half ready, some were just being started,” he said.
Photos and a video released by the police showed the vehicles, along with bonnets and seats with Ferrari and Lamborghini logos.
Luxury sports cars that would cost around £320,000-£640,000 ($400,000-$800,000) if genuine were being sold for £38,000-£53,000 ($47,000-$66,000), police said. But while exteriors looked convincing – at least to an untrained eye – the motors came from other vehicles including a Mitsubishi Eclipse, an Alfa Romeo and a Chevrolet Omega. 
“The motors were much less powerful,” Fragelli said. “The finishing depended on what the client could pay.”
No arrests were made, but police said they would charge a 53-year-old man and his son, 29, who were not arrested, for intellectual property offences.
“It is a crime against intellectual property because of the use of the logos and the use of the industrial designs,” Fragelli said.
The cars were documented as “prototypes”, he said. “But there are indications of fraud because you can’t register a homemade prototype car with a registered car logo.”
Police had been informed of the garage by a São Paulo law firm, who had been retained by Lamborghini after alerting the car company to the replicas.
Bruno Ariboni Brandi, a lawyer from Ariboni, Fabbri & Schmidt, said his firm had worked on similar cases before spotting the adverts. In February, police raided a similar workshop near São Paulo, but Brandi said the Itajaí workshop was believed to be the biggest in Brazil.
“This is a company that has been investigated for some time,” he said. “We also collected information from dissatisfied customers … The cars are low-quality. Even though they use good quality material, their interior finishing is not the same as the originals.”
In an email, a Lamborghini spokesman said the company did not intend to prosecute but wanted to avoid the “unlawful use of rights” and stressed “the risk for customers and the public in general” presented by replicas lacking “basic safety features”. Ferrari did not respond to questions.
Autos Fibra still has a functioning Instagram account and YouTube channel. Reached by phone, one of the men facing charges declined to answer questions and referred to a video posted on YouTube on Tuesday. In it, two men attacked “sensationalist” and “rotten” media that wanted to “denigrate” their company. 
“We did not close. We are working normally. There are cars being made for customers there and our commitment is to finish these cars,” said the elder of the two men, explaining that the company had been in operation for 25 years.
He said the company produced “artisanal cars” legally under a Brazilian regulation and that the investigation would show that the vehicles seized did not “100%” match industrial designs and therefore would be shown not to be replicas.
Brandi, the lawyer, disputed this. “The law of industry property prohibits the use of industrial designs and logos,” he said.

Sibal, his wife fired journos without pay, sent bouncers: Barkha Dutt
Journalist Barkha Dutt has accused Congress leader Kapil Sibal and his wife Promila Sibal of not giving salaries to 200 journalists working at Tiranga TV and asking them to leave without the promised compensation. She also accused them of sending bouncers to intimidate employees protesting inside the office. However, the Sibals denied the allegations, saying the due salaries were cleared.
https://thewire.in/media/tiranga-tv-kapil-sibal-promila-barkha-dutt?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts
The Wire
New Delhi: A day after senior journalist Barkha Dutt accused them of not paying Tiranga TV staff their salaries and asking employees to leave without paying them the promised compensation, senior advocate and channel financier Kapil Sibal and his wife, Promila, who is a director in the company, denied the allegations to The Wire.
The Sibals have said that all staff members, including Dutt, have been paid salaries till the end of June and the company had adhered to the “terms of the contract” when it came to compensation.
On July 15, Dutt had, through a series of tweets, accused the couple of going back on assurances made to channel employees. She said that many of them had left their jobs to join the new television channel where they were allegedly promised the minimum of a two-year tenure.
Wages up to June cleared: Kapil
Talking to The Wire, Kapil Sibal said all commitments made by the company were honoured. “We have paid salaries to all the employees for the month of June. The employees have been offered a month’s salary as compensation apart from their remaining wages for the current month,” he said.
Promila, who was looking after the administration of the channel, said that the two-year assurance was “a blatant lie”.
“Everything is in writing in the contract letters of the employees. In fact, the contracts even say that probationers can be removed with just three-days’ notice but even they are being offered a month’s salary to leave,” she added.
Dutt had claimed that paying six months’ wages as pay-out was the industry norm in such cases. She had written on Twitter that least three months’ salary should be paid to employees if they are being asked to leave.

 ‘Disciplinarian grounds’
Promila said even Dutt’s own contract had it that “the length of the contract is for one year starting first October (2018).”
“If the consulting editor leaves earlier then she has to serve a month’s notice. If she is removed or the channel fails to launch or folds operations midway, then the consulting editor will be compensated or remunerated for the remaining period of one year. This is because the consulting editor has already spent a year on the project and not taken salary for five months,” she said.
Promila then said that Dutt’s contract was “due to expire at the end of September 2019 anyway” and that she was not entitled to any compensation beyond that.
To this, Kapil further added that since Dutt’s services were terminated on July 13, the day on which she had levelled serious allegations against the Sibals, she was not entitled to any compensation beyond that day as “she had been terminated on disciplinarian [sic] grounds”.
Dutt disputes this claim, and says she was sacked for speaking out in internal emails against the treatment of other staffers.
On the compensation issue, Dutt told The Wire, “Sibal lies again. The contract clearly stipulates that if [the] channel shuts before the year or even [if] the contract [is] terminated, the remaining period of a [year is] to be paid.”
‘Equated with Mallya for going to London for family event’

In her tweets, Dutt said that she had in her mails accused the couple of fleeing the country to London like liquor baron Vijay Mallya.
Promila stated that they had “not fled due to any financial reason” but had only gone to celebrate their grandson’s academic success. “And we were there for only a short period,” she added.
Foul language charge
Dutt had also accused the couple of cheating employees and using foul language against women staffers by referring to them “kutiya” or “bitch” and exhorted National Commission for Women chairperson Rekha Sharma to act on the matter.
Promila called the charge frivolous. “Both Kapil and I have not met her for the last three to four months and there was no mention of such an episode in her earlier mails,” she said.
Kapil added that while initially Dutt had accused Promila of using such language, “later on, upon allegedly realising that a complaint against another woman could not be made out in the NCW, she wrote as an afterthought” that he too had used the foul word.

Promila also took umbrage to Dutt saying that she runs a meat business. “I did indeed have a successful meat business from 1979 to 2004, but then I gave it up as Kapil Sibal became a minister and he did not want me to carry on with it. I owned the premises thereafter too but the business was being run by a well-known company, Allana Group. They too shut their operations at my plants last year,” she added.

Financial trouble even before launch
Promila also told The Wire that the company had been facing financial problems even before the flagship channel was launched.
“In September 2018, we wanted to drop the idea of launching the channel but Dutt protested saying many journalists and other employees had left their jobs to join us. So we reluctantly decided to go ahead with it,” she said.
Immediately after its launch, the company faced several problems including an issue with its first name, “Harvest TV”, said Promila. The problems kept on coming as some DTH operators allegedly refused to give the channel space saying they had no bandwidth to offer. With advertisers not coming forth for fear of being persecuted by the Narendra Modi government, she said the financial hardships only deepened.
She also said that indiscretion in picking material suppliers had resulted in over-spending on equipment. Along with high offers of salaries, they had put additional burden on the company.
“Despite all of this, we met the heads of departments yesterday (July 16) and urged them to accept our offer of a month’s salary as compensation. We did not want to part bitterly, but the verbal assault has really left us pained,” she said.
Promila also said that the “first priority would be to reach an amicable settlement” but if that does not come through, the couple “are prepared for the legal battle ahead.”
Note: The story was updated to add Barkha Dutt’s comment on the contents of her contract.

Woman rescued from Mumbai building debris as rescuers spot gold ring
A 23-year-old woman named Zinat Rehman Salmani was rescued from the debris of the 100-year-old Mumbai building that collapsed on Tuesday after the fire brigade and NDRF rescue workers spotted her gold ring. She was trapped under iron beams, a wooden door, and an LPG cylinder for over two hours. Zinat was rescued from the debris after a one-and-a-half-hour operation.

Free Press Journal
The collapse of a residential building Tuesday in the congested Dongri area has once again put the focus on Mumbai's stressed infrastructure. Every year, the financial capital sees instances of building collapse, foot overbridge accidents and other life-threatening but preventable incidents.
The four-storey residential structure in Dongri in south Mumbai caved in shortly before noon, killing at least 14 people and trapping more than 40 people under the debris. The injured were immediately taken to the Sir Jamshedji Jeejeebhoy (JJ) Hospital for the treatment. This was the latest addition in the list of such tragedies in the Mumbai metropolitan area which is replete with tales of sheer negligence and apathy by authorities tasked with overseeing development and maintenance of buildings and infrastructure assets.
The building was unauthorised, officials of the Maharashtra Housing and Area Development Authority (MHADA) said, adding it was not under its supervision. It stood behind the 100-year-old Kesarbai building which is under MHADA's jurisdiction and already vacated because of its condition, the officials said. The difficult access to the site prevented ambulances and earth movers from being deployed, and rescue workers, including residents, used bare hands to remove concrete chunks, door frames and household items. Ambulances had to be parked some 50 metres away.
Here are some tragic tales which emerged from debris:
1. Wife and son untraceable
Nawab Shamani, one of the people who was injured in the Dongri building collapse, was admitted to hospital and had no idea where his wife and son were. "My mother is seriously injured and other family members, including my wife and son, are still untraceable," Nawab Shamani, from his hospital bed in a voice that is a mixture of pain and anguish, told the PTI.
Shamani, who works in Delhi, was visiting his extended family. While resting on a bed in state-run J J Hospital, Shamani, who is in his 30s, said he could only recall that he was sleeping in a flat in the ill-fated building and suddenly heard a loud thud.
"Next thing I remember is I am lying on a hospital bed with some injuries to my head and a hand," he said. What worries the young man more is that even after seven hours after the mishap, his wife Sana and son Ibrahim are still untraceable. "My mother is seriously injured but she is out of danger. I have informed authorities about my family members but have received no information from them about their whereabouts so far. They are still untraceable even around 6-7 hours after the tragedy," Shamani told the PTI.
2. Double tragedy in the family
While Shamani was searching his wife and son, the Shaikh family, who resided in Kesarbai building which collapsed on Tuesday, was suffering from a double tragedy. The 25-year-old mother of two children, Sabiya Nasir Shaikh, lost her life when she went to the kitchen to make tea. Her father-in-law, Abdul Sattar Kalu Shaikh, who was one of the committee members of the local Abdul Rehman dargah, also succumbed to the head injuries he received as he was in the midst of some work near the kitchen. “He felt a tremor and shouted out but it was too late,” Shoaib Ahmed, a relative of the Shaikhs told the Free Press Journal.
3. One injured while rescuing others
Imran Husain Kalwaniya (30), who resides opposite Kesaribai building, heard a loud boom and saw the building crumble right before his eyes. Without any second thought, Imran ran down the stairs of his building to help those affected by the tragedy. While he was helping he suffered injuries. “I wasted no time to rush to the spot so that I could be of some help. After lifting the debris, I managed to save the life of a baby stuck under the debris. I also managed to save a man who was gasping for air as he was buried under some bricks,” Imran told the Free Press Journal.
4. Deceased UP brothers had come to Mumbai to overcome mother’s loss
So far 14 people have been killed in Dongri building collapse. Out of these 14, two brothers, who had come from Uttar Pradesh after mother’s death, lost their life. According to the Hindustan Times, 20-year-old Zuber Mansoor Salmani, and his brother Muzamil (15) who lost their lives in Tuesday’s mishap were residents of Bijnor, Uttar Pradesh. The duo had lost their mother around five months ago and their father Mansoor had brought them to Mumbai to visit their aunt Firdoz Salmani, who resided in the Dongri building so that they could overcome their grief. On Tuesday, after the building collapsed, Muzamil’s body was among the third to be pulled out of the debris, while Salmani’s body was found later.
5. Man hunts for missing wife and two sons
In another tragic incident, a man named Rashid Ali, who runs a workshop of readymade garments in the locality, stood outside the casualty gate of Sir JJ Hospital, expecting to find his wife and two sons. Shabbir Ali, Rashid’s brother, told the Hindustan Times, that Rashid had left for work on Tuesday morning, leaving behind his family. But until evening, there were no traces of the trio. Rashid’s family stayed on rent on the ground floor of the four-storeyed building in Dongri which collapsed on Tuesday. While Rashid’s wife is in her 20s, his sons are aged five and seven. Rashid had brought his wife to Mumbai from Uttar Pradesh (UP) two months ago to seek medical treatment for her.
Lucky escape
Woman rescued after rescuers spot golden ring
The fire brigade and NDRF rescued Zinat Rehman Salmani (23) from the debris after a one-and-a-half-hour operation. She was one of the residents trapped in the debris for more than two hours. As luck would have it, a kid was extricated from the rubble and the volunteers were about to retreat when the golden glitter drew their attention, reported the Free Press Journal. She was trapped under iron beams, wooden door, and an LPG cylinder. After cutting through the iron beams and removing the debris using hydraulic cutters, spreader and power tools, Salmani was rescued. To ensure she remained dehydrated throughout, she was given water through the debris and the NDRF and fire brigade officers spoke to her to boost her morale. According to the authorities, Rehman’s rescue was one of the most difficult operations of this mishap. Before pulling her out to safety, the authorities had pulled out a child from the debris.

Sudan's ruling military and opposition sign power-sharing deal
Sudan's ruling military and opposition leaders have signed a power-sharing deal. The deal establishes a new transitional ruling body which will comprise of civilians and military leaders. A general will head the body for the first 21 months, then a civilian-run administration would take over for the remaining 18 months, followed by elections, as per the agreement.
https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jul/17/sudan-military-and-protesters-sign-power-sharing-accord?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts
The Guardian
Military rulers in Sudan signed an agreement with protesters on Wednesday to share power with civilian leaders.
The deal comes after lengthy and difficult negotiations between generals who seized power after the fall of Omar al-Bashir in April and leaders of the pro-democracy campaign whose demonstrations led to the veteran dictator’s fall.
Analysts say it offers a chance to end months of political crisis and repeated bouts of violent repression, but that much will depend on further talks on the exact details and timing of any political transition.
The two sides initialled a document called the “political declaration” after intense talks through the night.
The deputy chief of the ruling military council, Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo – who initialled the deal on behalf of the generals – said the agreement was a “historic moment” for Sudan.
“I am pleased this morning to give this good news to the great Sudanese people … of the signing of the political agreement,” Dagalo, also known as Hemedti, said on Wednesday morning.
Ibrahim al-Amin, a key protest leader, confirmed that a declaration had been agreed, and that talks on a new constitution would resume on Friday.
“We want a stable homeland, because we have suffered a great deal,” he said.
The outlines of the deal were agreed almost two weeks ago but the military repeatedly missed deadlines to sign.
One point of contention during the negotiations was a demand from civilians that military leaders remain accountable for human rights abuses committed in recent months.
In June, paramilitaries broke up a peaceful sit-in in Khartoum, the capital. More than 100 people died and many more were injured in the attack. There were also reports of scores of rapes. There have been further deaths and injuries since at the hands of security forces.
The violence prompted international outrage, although Sudan’s military rulers insisted they did not order the violent dispersal of protesters.
Dagalo is the leader of the Rapid Support Forces (RSF), accused of committing the worst abuses in recent months.
There are reports of continuing violent repression by the RSF. The Central Committee of Sudan Doctors, an NGO, said the paramilitaries shot “at peaceful civilians in the city of Omdurman” on Tuesday, wounding three civilians.
That Dagalo, officially only second in command, signed the agreement on behalf of the military rulers is being seen as a sign of his increasing power and influence.
Opposition activists with knowledge of the talks told the Guardian that the signed deal includes provision for an independent and impartial investigation into the attack on the sit-in.
“That was an absolute obligation for us. It is [a duty] owed to the martyrs and their families,” said one activist, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
Reaction in Khartoum to news of the deal, being brokered by African Union and Ethiopian mediators, was muted on Wednesday. There have been demonstrations in recent days calling for justice for those killed during the protests.
Khalda Yacoub, a 27-year-old Khartoum-based English teacher and activist, said the deal would not stop “the killing of people in this country”.
“This is a political agreement, and there are divisions between the two sides. The problem is that the members of the [ruling military council] are part of the former regime and they need to change the way they deal with people,” Yacoub said.
Some were optimistic, however. Mohamed Eissa, 35, an engineer who moved to Khartoum from the Darfur region, said he was “so happy”.
“I think our crisis should only be solved politically,” he said. “The idea of having a radical change is impossible. This country is very fragile. I have worked in different places of Sudan and I know the amount of the weapons there are, so in our best interest is to reach to a deal.”
The agreement should lead to the establishment of a new transitional civilian-military ruling body which will comprise six civilians and five military representatives.
The civilians will include five from the pro-democracy coalition the Alliance for Freedom and Change.
A general will head the ruling body during the first 21 months of the transition, followed by a civilian for the remaining 18 months, according to the framework agreement.
That body is to oversee the formation of a transitional civilian administration that will govern for just over three years, after which elections would be held.
Harriet Baldwin, UK minister for Africa, welcomed a “momentous day for Sudan”.
“Today’s agreement is a step towards the change so bravely demanded by the Sudanese people. Everyone must be involved: men, women, young and old, from across Sudan,” she said in a statement.
Observers say however that many of the most difficult questions are yet to be settled and a transition to full civilian government is still extremely uncertain.
The crisis has exacerbated a deteriorating economic situation, a consequence of 30 years of incompetent, corrupt and repressive rule by Bashir.
Mahmud Dirir, an Ethiopian mediator of the deal, said Sudan needed to overcome poverty and called for the country to be taken off a U.S. list of states that support terrorism.

Tourists escape as elephant rams into jeep in S Africa; video viral
A video taken during a jungle safari in South Africa shows an elephant running and ramming into a tourists' jeep multiple times. The jeep's driver can be seen driving the jeep in reverse to help the tourists escape even as the elephant continued to charge towards them. Many tourists in the jeep were reportedly from Australia.

Footage taken on a jungle safari in South Africa shows the exact moment a group of tourists had a lucky escape from a rampaging elephant.
The wild animal was filmed charging at tourists who were on board a Jeep and travelling through the region.  
Some of the people on board were believed to be Australian.
The vision showed the driver desperately attempting to reverse out of the elephant's path as it continued to charge toward them.
The tourists all remained calm throughout the ordeal, with some even choosing to film it.

Viewers on the Reddit thread where the video was shared commended the driver's ability to 'floor it in reverse and still not topple over'. 
Others noted it 'probably wasn't his first time in the situation'. 
Meanwhile, others said they must have been Australian because they all remained so calm. 
'You can tell they're Australian because of the accent but mainly because they're not screaming.
'Takes more than an elephant to get an Aussie sheila to scream.' 
Those at the back of the jeep continued to assist the driver by offering directions and describing what was in his path as he continued to drive backwards.
The vision cut off before the tourists were out of harm's way.

United to resume Delhi, Mumbai flights as Pakistan reopens airspace
United Airlines said it'd restart daily non-stop service between New York/Newark, New Delhi and Mumbai from September 6, after Pakistan lifted airspace restrictions. The restrictions, imposed in February, added flight time for passengers and fuel costs for airlines as they were forced to take long detours. India said Pakistan's reopening of airspace brought in "significant relief for airlines".

The company will also start a new daily service between San Francisco and New Delhi beginning Dec. 5, a spokesman said. 
Pakistan reopened its airspace to international civil aviation on Tuesday after months of restrictions imposed because of clashes with India, which forced long detours that cost airlines millions of dollars.

RSS economic wing says India should not issue foreign currency bonds
RSS' economic wing Swadeshi Jagran Manch's co-convener Ashwani Mahajan has demanded that government review its plan to raise money by selling foreign currency bonds. He said the experience of countries that have taken loans from international markets to meet the budget deficit "has been far from good". "We are confident that government will withdraw its decision," Mahajan added.

Reuters
NEW DELHI/MUMBAI (Reuters) - An influential Hindu nationalist group close to Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s ruling party has demanded his government review its plan to raise money by selling foreign currency bonds. 
They say it is anti-patriotic as it could create long-term risks for the economy, potentially allowing rich foreign nations and their financial institutions to dictate the country’s policies. 
“We can’t allow this to happen,” declared Ashwani Mahajan, the co-convenor of Swadeshi Jagran Manch (SJM), the economic wing of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS).  
The RSS was the key founder of the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party and has people it nurtured in top positions in the government, including Modi himself. 
Declaring that the SJM will campaign against the plan by convening meetings of influential economists, Mahajan said: “We are confident that government will withdraw its decision on these bonds.” 
“We must look at the experience of countries that have taken loans from international markets to meet their government deficit. The experience of these countries has been far from good,” he said, citing Argentina and Turkey as examples. 
Mahajan said going overseas to borrow may mean that the rupee currency depreciates at a faster rate and allows foreign governments to demand tariff reductions. 
A Finance Ministry spokesman declined to comment for this story. 
Speaking at a business summit in London, British Prime Minister Theresa May expressed hope that the Indian government would choose the British capital as the location to issue its first international sovereign bonds. 
New Delhi has not so far given any details about where they will be issued.  
Subhash Chandra Garg, the top official at the Finance Ministry, told Indian business leaders last week that the overseas debt move was part of efforts to bring down real interest rates for Indian firms, to help the economy grow faster.  
“We will have a very open attitude to welcome foreign investment and savings because that is what would be required,” he said. 
Garg said that the problem with relying so much on domestic debt was that the government tapped into nearly 80% of total savings in the economy, leaving little for private companies. As a result, those businesses are forced to pay up to 12-13% in interest rates on bank loans.  
The government has in the past considered raising funds from overseas markets but those tasked with determining the feasibility of such a plan have ended up recommending against it.  
“Most of the debt is of domestic origin, insulating the debt portfolio from currency risk,” India’s previous finance minister, Arun Jaitley, wrote in a paper on public debt in February last year.  
It is not only the RSS’ economic branch that has criticised the government’s proposal. 
India should worry about short-term “faddish investors buying when India is hot, and dumping us when it is not”, former central bank governor Raghuram Rajan wrote in an article for the Times of India newspaper last Saturday. 
The SJM has shown it can mobilise opinion to change government policy on several occasions in the past few years, including pushing it to take a harder line against genetically modified crops and a more protectionist stance on trade issues.  
It helped to pressure the government into introducing new e-commerce regulations in February that upset two American behemoths, Amazon.com Inc and Walmart. The U.S. companies said the move discriminated against them and favoured domestic retailers. 
But the BJP may not bend on this occasion. 
Gopal Krishna Agarwal, the BJP’s national spokesman on economic affairs, said that despite some risks highlighted by the critics, the sovereign bonds were the “best alternative” at this point, considering the government’s massive investment plans.  
The government’s goal of keeping real interest rates low makes it difficult to raise funds in the domestic market at reasonable rates, he added. 
Agarwal cautioned, however, that the government has to stick to its fiscal deficit target of 3.3% of GDP for the current year ending next March and ensure that overseas borrowing does not lead to a higher deficit. 
Based on its sovereign credit rating, which stands at ‘BBB-‘, analysts suggest India would be able to raise U.S. dollar funds overseas at about 3.2% at current market rates, though that figure would rise once hedging costs are taken into account. 
The 10-year government bond, the most liquid paper in the domestic debt market, closed at 6.33% on Tuesday. 
Overseas borrowing exposes the government’s liabilities to currency fluctuations and can therefore impact domestic interest rates. 
“India’s vulnerability to external events is very high given its disproportionately high dependence on imported oil,” said Rupa Rege Nitsure, chief economist at L&T Financial Holdings.

Jaiswal was allegedly forced to transfer his business to them.On June 2, Ahmed was transferred to the Ahmadabad prison from the Naini jail. A Supreme Court bench, headed by Chief Justice Ranjan Gogoi, had ordered Ahmed's transfer.Earlier, a special court had rejected Ahmed's plea seeking parole for contesting the Lok Sabha polls against Prime Minister Narendra Modi from Varanasi. In 2014, he had contested from Phulpur parliamentary constituency on a Samajwadi Party ticket. (ANI)

ANI
New Delhi (India), July 16 (ANI): In the backdrop of public hue and cry over the deaths of cows at a cow-shelter in Uttar Pradesh's Barabanki district, BJP MLA Ajay Singh on Tuesday said most of the deaths are from natural causes, adding that there is no laxity on the part of government to provide shelter and fodder to cattle. "Every animal has a life span. Human beings have a life span of 100 years while cattle's life is for 20 years. Even those cattle that are taken care of very well live for 12-13 years. There is much outcry but most of the cattle have died a natural death," he said.Singh also demanded accident services to be put in place for cattle."I had demanded from Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath that ambulance services should be started for animals similar as we have an ambulance for human beings. Animals are meeting accidents on road, on Highways," he said.Locals in Barabanki's Safdarganj on Monday alleged that some cows at a cow shelter died due to lack of fodder and water and poorly maintained the shelter. "We do not get proper fodder for cattle. No sufficient funds provided for the upkeep of the shelter. Around two to three cattle have died due to miserable conditions of shelter," a worker at the cow shelter had said.However, Barabanki District Magistrate denied allegations of lack of funds and fodder-water in the shelter. "The matter will be investigated and if found true then strict action would be taken. But as far as I know, there is no lack of fodder-water at any cow-shelter," he said.Last month, over a dozen cows allegedly starved to death in Jalalabad cow shelter of Uttar Pradesh's Kannauj district, triggering protests by locals outside a cow shelter.Following this,  Adityanath had held a meeting with the officials of Gau Seva Aayog and Animal Husbandry Department in Lok Bhavan to discuss the issue of stray cattle in the region.He had instructed the officials to ensure that all the cow-sheds are self-reliant in order to combat the menace.The Chief Minister had also announced that the government will give Rs 30 on a daily basis for each cattle for the fodder if the owners are not using them for commercial purpose. He instructed the officials to take this plan as a pilot project in the Bundelkhand region. (ANI)

Pakistan spin legend Saqlain Mushtaq, who was a part of England’s World Cup-winning squad’s support staff, has been rewarded with a 55-day extension which will cover the entire Ashes series.
Saqlain told PTI that he will be working with the English team as a spin consultant. England won the World Cup on superior boundary count after the summit clash against New Zealand ended in a tie in both the regulation 50 overs as well as the Super Over.
“It was great to see England winning the World Cup after such a pulsating final. The victory can be put down to great handling by the head coach, Trevor Bayliss, and great camaraderie among the players,” Saqlain said.
The 42-year-old off-spinner, who bagged a total of 496 Test and one-day wickets for his country, has never been engaged by the Pakistan Cricket Board to work on the support staff of the Pakistan team.

The PCB had hired him for a few weeks before the 2015 World Cup to correct the bowling action of off-spinner Saeed Ajmal but he has never been given a long-term assignment.
Saqlain said England had worked very hard for the World Cup success in the last few years.
“The English players are very close to each other and they are constantly supporting each other and helping each other out even the guys who are not in the playing eleven on a given match day,” he said.

New Delhi: A Vistara flight travelling from Mumbai to Delhi with 163 people on board made an emergency landing in Lucknow after it had just a few more minutes of fuel left.
Vistara’s Mumbai-Delhi UK 944 was hovering over Delhi for nearly 3-1/2 hours on Monday due to poor weather conditions following which it was diverted towards Lucknow. The aircraft also considered Kanpur and Allahabad (Prayagraj) as alternate airports.
However, the pilots declared ‘Mayday’ as the situation worsened with barely 10 minutes of fuel left. The air traffic controllers at Lucknow airport saved the day as flying to Prayagraj, the next nearest airport, would have taken at least 30 minutes more.
“The pilot who was operating UK944 flight and issued a ‘Mayday’ call on Monday has been grounded by the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA),” a source told news agency PTI.
On a normal occasion, an Airbus A-320 NEO which operated flight UK 944 has enough fuel for at least 60 extra minutes of flight that is used in such situations where the aircraft has to be diverted to alternate destinations.
A Vistara spokesperson stated, “The unexpected drop in visibility at the destination alternate was the main reason why the aircraft ended up in a low-fuel situation despite carrying excess fuel over and above the required Flight Plan Fuel as per regulations. Safety of passengers and crew was kept at the highest priority throughout the flight.”
The pilot flying the Vistara aircraft has been ‘de-rostered’ as per instructions of the regulator. (With PTI inputs)

MUMBAI: Troubled wind turbine maker Suzlon Energy Ltd on Tuesday said it has failed to make a payment of principal amount of $172 million for outstanding bonds, due in July.
The outstanding payment was part of a total bond issuance of $546.91 million, the company said in a filing to stock exchanges.
“The company is working on a holistic solution for its debt and continues to be in discussions with various stakeholders in relation to its outstanding debt (including the bonds)," Suzlon said in the filing.
On 11 July, Bloomberg reported that Canadian asset manager Brookfield Asset Management Inc. is planning an offer for a majority stake in Suzlon. The Toronto-based investment firm is working with a financial adviser for due diligence on Suzlon, it reported, adding that Brookfield proposes to start with buying new shares issued by the company, followed by purchasing stocks from the existing holders under an open offer, the people said.
As part of the proposed deal, the Canadian company is in discussion with Suzlon’s creditors to restructure the outstanding bank loans of more than  ₹11,000 crore ($1.6 billion), under a one-time settlement plan, Bloomberg reported.
In 2015, pharma billionaire Dilip Shanghvi invested  ₹1,800 crore in Suzlon for a 23% stake, hoping to turn around the company.
On Tuesday, shares of Suzlon closed at 4.67 apiece, down 3.11% on BSE, while the benchmark Sensex closed at 39,131.04 points, up 0.6%.

The Trinamool Congress has written to Rajya Sabha Chairman Venkaiah Naidu and Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla, complaining against both Houses of Parliament allowing repeated questions on the law and order situation in West Bengal despite rules stating that members “shall not repeat in substance questions already answered”.
The letters were authored by Rajya Sabha MP Derek O’Brien and Lok Sabha MP Sudip Bandyopadhyay.

Bandyopadhyay cited Rule 41 (xiii) of the Rules of Procedure and Conduct of Business in the Lok Sabha, which says a member “shall not repeat in substance questions already answered’’. According to his letter to the Lok Sabha Speaker, three questions on political violence in Bengal during the 2019 general elections, have been allowed in the lower house.
Similarly, O’Brien referred to Rule 47 (xiv) of the Rules of Procedure and Conduct of Business in the Rajya Sabha, informing Chairman Venkaiah Naidu that four questions had been allowed on political violence in Bengal in the current session.
In their separate letters, the TMC leaders wrote, “This is butchering the parliamentary democratic process. Why is the Bengal government being targeted in such a manner? We strongly protest this and request you to kindly look into it.’’
O’Brien also pointed out that 10 advisories have been sent by the Centre to the West Bengal government in as short a span as ten days. Earlier in the day, TMC MP Sudip Bandyopadhyay had made the same statement in the Lok Sabha, claiming that the Bengal government was being unnecessarily harassed for political motives.

New Delhi [India], July 16 (ANI) Senior Congress leader Mallikarjun Kharge on Tuesday expressed confidence on Congress-JD(S) coalition winning the vote of confidence in the Karnataka assembly on Thursday but said the party has to "guard its people" as BJP wants to create hindrances for his party."We have numbers but that will be known on (July) 18th.

Kharge said the ruling coalition was moving vote of confidence as it is sure of winning it."We are confident that's why we said that we are moving vote of confidence. Otherwise why should we move.  What other legal issues will come after the judgement, that should also be seen tomorrow," he said.

Somebody is inducing, somebody is forcing, somebody is harassing them.  There may be threat from BJP government at Centre. Otherwise why? If everybody is fair they should stay here only," he said.

Snapdeal a proud exception in Indian e-commerce: CEO Bahl
Snapdeal Co-founder and CEO Kunal Bahl claimed the e-commerce platform's consolidated revenue rose by 73% to ₹925 crore while loss fell 70% year-on-year to ₹186 crore. Over the last two years, Snapdeal's loss was reduced by 96%, he said. "This makes us the proud exception in Indian e-commerce, where greater growth usually means greater losses," Bahl added.

Bloomberg Quint
The co-founder and chief executive of Snapdeal wrote today about how the e-commerce firm managed to cut its losses sharply in the year ended March as it continues its turnaround.
The SoftBank-backed e-commerce firm’s loss fell 70 percent year-on-year to Rs 186 crore, Kunal Bahl said in a blogpost.
Consolidated revenue, Bahl said, rose almost twofold to Rs 925 crore over the pervious year and revenue from operations grew 87 percent to Rs 813 crore. “This makes us the proud exception in Indian e-commerce, where greater growth usually means greater losses.”
The company’s turnaround, Snapdeal 2.0, came as it moved towards seller-branded products, with about 80 percent of business coming from small towns and cities, Bahl said. This market, he said, is worth $163 billion and comprises nearly 400 million potential buyers.
Snapdeal, which survived a failed merger with larger rival Flipkart over two years ago, said its product selection has grown to over 200 million listings. In the last two years, the company said it has seen over 60,000 new sellers coming on board, adding over 50 million new listings.
The company, which posted a profit in June 2018, is investing to fuel growth. We’re not aiming for triple-digit growth rates as that can’t be achieved without compromising on economics and experience, he said. “Consistently compounding revenue growth create large and valuable enterprises.”
The Delhi-based company, which was planning to acquire peer Shopclues, called of talks last month as concerns emerged from due diligence that was conducted by EY.

SP, VHP leaders shot dead in two separate incidents in UP
A VHP leader and SP leader were shot dead in separate incidents in Uttar Pradesh. VHP's Pranav Mishra was killed by unidentified bike-borne assailants and SP leader Akhilesh Yadav (not to be confused with SP President) was killed when he was working out at a gym. "Criminals have no fear of police in the state," SP President Akhilesh Yadav said.

The Financial Express
A Faizabad-based youth leader of the Samajwadi Party has been shot dead, police said Tuesday.
Thirty-year-old Akhilesh Yadav of Kanakpur village in Maharajganj police station area was shot at point blank range when he was working out at a gym near his house on Monday evening, Faizabad SSP Ashish Tiwari said.
He was the area president of the Samajwadi Lohiya Vahini, the officer said.
The incident prompted the Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav to attack Yogi Adityanath government over “deteriorating” law and order situation in the state.
“Criminals have no fear of police in the state. Crime is rising while law and order is deteriorating in the state. The state governor might say UP is heading on the path of becoming the best state, but in reality, it is becoming synonymous with fear and terror for the people,” said the SP president.
He said one of his party leaders was killed in Faizabad on Monday, while similar incidents are reported from all over the state exposing the “tall claims” of the government on law and order situation in the state.
Giving details of the killing of the SP youth leader in the district, Faizabad SSP Tiwari said, “(Slain leader) Akhilesh Yadav was shot by one Aditya Singh. The duo had a dispute over the operation of a transport firm.”
“Accused Aditya Singh and his accomplices who helped him in the murder are absconding,” the SSP said, adding efforts are on to arrest them.
The youth leader was rushed to the district hospital where doctors declared him brought dead, police said.
Meanwhile, party activists led by former minister Pawan Pandey blocked traffic on the main city road in front of the Faizabad district hospital, demanding the arrest of the accused.
The police had to use mild force to disperse the protestors and clear the traffic blockade.

Jofra Archer's old tweets resurface, users connect it with WC final
England fast bowler Jofra Archer's old tweets went viral, with fans connecting them to the 2019 World Cup final. Users related his 2013 tweet reading, "16 from 6" with the target set for New Zealand by England in the Super Over. Users also shared his 2015 tweet reading "What stupid rule is this," after the final ended on boundary count.

England won the World Cup for the first time in their history after a cliffhanger of a final which went into the super over. Jofra Archer who only became eligible to play for them just before the mega event was at the centre stage again as he was handed the ball to deliver the super over. It looked all destined for the Caribbean born cricketer who made the cut at the last moment and here he was, delivering for his team to win the World Cup. He did it successfully, in the end, to etch his name in history.
It was a memorable World Cup for Archer. He was always the lead bowler for England and ended up picking 20 wickets in 11 matches. Whenever they needed a wicket, Eoin Morgan looked at him and Archer didn’t disappoint. The same happened on Sunday as well and the 24-year-old obliged helping England win the title. However, more than his performance, his tweets were going viral throughout the tournament.

After having tweeted earlier about the semi-final clash between England and Australia, Jofra Archer once again proved that he is from the future with his hilarious tweets about the final.
With England needing 15 from the last over and after all the drama unfolded, the equation had come down to 2 runs off the last ball. At the same time, Jofra Archer’s tweet reading, “Wouldn’t mind the super over,” went viral and as the destiny had it, the man himself was at the helm to defend 16 runs later.
Interestingly, New Zealand needed 16 off 6 deliveries in the super over and the pacer had a similar tweet on his timeline which is seriously crazy. A lot of such tweets related to certain matches have been already tweeted by him and this World Cup was a testimony to it.
Having said that, Jofra Archer delivered when it mattered the most for his team and has the World Cup trophy to his name today. He has a long way to go in his career and it should be no surprise if he is picked in the England squad for the Ashes which is set to begin from August 1.

The New Zealand team ended up being the bridesmaids for the second time in a row when England defeated them thanks to a technicality in the final played at the Lord’s Cricket Ground. The Kane Williamson-led side was equal to England at all levels and the match ended in a tie with both teams on 241 runs and even the Super Over ended at levels with 15 runs each.
It can be said that luck was not with the Kiwis in the match as in the last few overs they managed to let a few things slip out of their hands. A turning point in the proceedings was Trent Boult taking Ben Stokes’ catch and then stepped onto the boundary ropes. Then the infamous four overthrows happened which was added to the two runs the batsmen completed and England got six runs off that ball. Though controversial, the runs stood and helped the hosts square the target.

In the Super Over, New Zealand was asked to chase down 15 runs and Jimmy Neesham made 13 of those, including a six off Jofra Archer. With two needed off the last ball, Martin Guptill was run out attempting the second and England won the encounter as they had hit more boundaries than their opponents and became World Champions.
Neesham was gutted and consoled Guptill, whose throw had hit Stokes’ bat and went for four runs turning the game on its head and couldn’t seal the deal when it mattered the most. He went on Twitter after the game and put a message on that kids shouldn’t take up sports due to the heartbreak and advised them to take up bakery and life their life happily.
Neesham tweeted, “Kids, don’t take up sport. Take up baking or something. Die at 60 really fat and happy.”

However, one celebrity from the field of movies and entertainment, who was once known for his enormous girth disagreed with Neesham’s advise. Adnan Sami, the famous singer replied to the cricketer saying that he should be proud of the way he and his team played. He also said that being fat doesn’t necessary means happiness.
Sami, who became famous due to his amazing voice and for being on the heavier side on the weighing scale; made a complete transformation a few years ago and even got Indian citizenship, leaving behind his home country of Pakistan.
Sami tweeted, “Hey chin-up mate! You guys were brilliant. Besides, fatness doesn’t necessarily lead to happiness. You all taught the world the most important lesson of how to fight. Much love!”

Breathtaking: Biologist on finding rare human-sized jellyfish
Wildlife host and biologist Lizzie Daly, sharing her encounter with a rare human-sized barrel jellyfish, described it as a "breathtaking" and "serene, grounding experience". "I know barrel jellyfish get really big in size but I have never seen anything like it before," Daly said. The giant 1.5-metre-long barrel jellyfish was spotted off the south-western coast of England last week.
https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/jul/15/giant-jellyfish-cornwall-coast-divers?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts
The Guardian
A giant barrel jellyfish has been spotted off the coast of Cornwall by divers.
“I’ve never seen one that big,” said Lizzie Daly, a biologist who saw the creature near Falmouth. “We had seen a few smaller jellyfish at a beautiful reef nearby, and then out of the murk came this huge, beautiful jelly fish. You just take a double look and ask yourself if it’s actually a metre and a half long.”
She said swimming alongside the “gentle giant” was “such a serene, grounding experience”.
Thousands of the creatures, the largest jellyfish found in British coastal waters, flock through the Atlantic Ocean towards warm coastal waters in the west of the UK each year and are often found washed up on beaches across May and June.
Owing to the late summer, the animals, which normally measure up to about a metre with their tentacles, were still being spotted in south-west England, south Wales and elsewhere. This was not unusual, Daly said, and the sightings were not part of a “freak jellyfish wash-up”.
Daly and an underwater camera operator, Dan Abbott, were diving in Falmouth as part of the online series Wild Ocean Week and stayed with the abnormally large, translucent bell-mushroom-shaped animal for about an hour before it swam away.
The pair said they were not surprised by the animal’s behaviour. “It has got a very mild sting and poses no threat to humans – some people don’t even feel it,” Daly said. “Many people would be immediately worried, but it is not dangerous. Its a majestic creature.”
However, she said her response may have differed if it was a Portuguese man o’ war, which carries a potentially deadly sting.
Dr Michele Kiernan from the Marine Biological Association in Plymouth said little was known about the lifestyles of barrel jellyfish, including where their young live, and that their movements were at the mercy of winds and currents.
“As we’ve had a long spell of no rain in the south-west, people can see them more easily because of the clarity in the water,” she said.
Their predators could also be reducing in number, she continued. Barrel jellyfish are the favourite prey of leatherback turtles, while they are also eaten by other animals which are increasingly “getting caught in entanglements and waste in the water.”
In 2015, flocks of barrel jellyfish, which each have eight frilly tentacles, were seen gliding through the sea off the Cornwall coast. The animals, nicknamed dustbin lid jellyfish because of their shape and size, are attracted inshore by plankton blooms.

959 students write same answers, make same errors in Guj 12th exam
Gujarat Secondary and Higher Secondary Education Board (GSHSEB) detected a mass copying incident where 959 students wrote the same answers and made the same mistakes in Class 12 exams. The students admitted the teachers at exam centres dictated answers to them. Their results have been withheld till 2020 and they've been failed in the subjects in which they allegedly cheated.

Times Now
Ahmedabad: Several mass cheating incidents have been reported in the past. However, a recent case from Gujarat has left officials shocked.
Gujarat Secondary and Higher Secondary Education Board (GSHSEB) recently unfolded a mass copying incident involving more than 950 students of class 12 general stream. This incident is said to be the single largest incident of mass cheating in the state board's recent history.
Despite the strict measures to check mass copying, as many as 959 students had written the same answers for the same questions. These students even committed the same mistakes in their answers.
The board authorities acted on several complaints and closely examined the answer sheets of examination centres from where such incidents were reported. The centres were mainly in Junagadh and Gir-Somnath districts.
These students were summoned by the exams reforms committee to verify the claims of mass cheating. They told the committee that the teachers at the exam centres dictated answers to them. The results of these students have been withheld till 2020 and they have been failed in the subjects in which they allegedly cheated.
As many as 959 students wrote exactly same answers for the same questions in the same sequence and made the same mistakes, sources said.
At one of the centres, as many as 200 students wrote an essay titled "Dikri Ghar Ni Divdi (Daughter is the earthern lamp of the family)" in the same way, the sources added.
"The board is planning to cancel examination centres at Amrapur (Gir-Somnath), Visanvel (Junagadh) and Prachi-Pipla (Gir-Somnath) for class 12 general stream," an official of GSHSEB said.
The sources further said that many of the students from Botad, Surendranagar, Rajkot and Ahmedabad, had paid an annual fee of about Rs 35,000 as external students in self-financed schools, however, they were shown as 'regular' students. The students claimed that they attended classes for only about two weeks.
In 2018, nearly 1,000 students were expelled for cheating during the Class 12 exams in Bihar. As many as 25 fake examiners were also caught. Anand Kishore, the Chairman of the Bihar School Examination Board (BSEB), had told the media that students were expelled "for adopting unfair means" during the examinations.

1 Vistara, 1 Air India, 2 SpiceJet pilots suspended over safety norms
Directorate General of Civil Aviation has suspended a Vistara pilot, a pilot and a crew member of Air India and two SpiceJet pilots for violation of safety norms. SpiceJet pilots were suspended for damaging runway lights during landing. Air India pilot and cabin crew member were suspended for fighting after the pilot asked the crew member to wash his tiffin.

Times Now
New Delhi: Aviation regulator Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) on Tuesday suspended three pilots - one from national carrier Air India and two from private airline SpiceJet - for violation of safety norms and grounded one Vistara pilot for diversion of his flight. One cabin crew of Air India has also been suspended. 
The aviation watchdog has suspended flying licences of three pilots for six months. According to a news agency, the Spicejet pilots have been suspended in connection with an incident on June 2 when an aircraft they were operating damaged runway edge lights during landing. 
The two SpiceJet pilots have been identified as Aarati Gunasekaran and Saurabh Gulia. The watchdog's decision has come after the replies provided by them to the show cause notice were not satisfactory, reported PTI. 
The Air India pilot and the cabin crew member have been suspended in relation to a physical altercation between the two inside the aircraft on June 17. According to reports, cabin crew member Rajat Verman was involved in a heated argument and physical altercation with pilot Milind when the plane was to depart from Bengaluru to Kolkata.
The two had an argument after the pilot reportedly asked the cabin crew member to wash his tiffin. The flight delayed by nearly two hours and could only take off after the crew and captain was replaced. "I have been told that the captain wanted the cabin crew member to clean the tiffin after he finished his meal. Probably, this is what led to a fight between them. An investigation has been started. Strict action will be taken," an Air India official had said. 
The Vistara pilot has been grounded in an incident of flight diversion on June 15. According to reports, the pilot had diverted the flight from Mumbai to Delhi to Lucknow due to bad weather, however, it was later revealed that the aircraft had less fuel. 
Yesterday, DGCA also asked Air India take 'strict' action against an airline pilot who reportedly failed the alcohol test twice. Reports suggest that the pilot had first failed the alcohol test on October 21, 2015, when he was scheduled to fly an aircraft from Goa and then recently on July 13 when he was off duty but was scheduled to travel as an Additional Crew Member (ACM) in the cockpit.

Madras Christian College prof sacked for sexually harassing students
Madras Christian College in Chennai has sacked Zoology professor R Raveen after an internal inquiry found him guilty of sexually harassing female students. Several students had complained that Raveen made lewd remarks about their clothes, harassed them and behaved inappropriately during a department trip earlier this year. Another faculty Samuel Tennyson was accused of abetting Raveen's behaviour.

The News Minute
The Madras Christian College in Chennai has sacked a professor from the department of Zoology after he was found guilty of sexually harassing the female students of the department during a college tour. R Raveen, who was an assistant professor in the Zoology department was dismissed after a detailed inquiry by the college Internal Complaints Committee into the incident. 
His colleague Samuel Tennyson, another faculty from the department, too had been accused of abetting Raveen's behaviour. However, the college is yet to dismiss Samuel due to a case filed by him on the issue in the Madras High Court. 
MCC's principal Alexander Jesudasan confirmed the dismissal. "We have dismissed the professor after the ICC found him guilty of multiple cases of sexual harassment against students of the department. As for Samuel, the college cannot issue a dismissal order as there is a court case pending on the issue. However, the court has directed Samuel not to enter the campus premises," the principal said. 
A student from the Zoology department also added that the dismissed professor had not visited the college for over three weeks. "Ever since college re-opened in June, he has not been coming to college. I had enquired with the other staff of the department and they also said that his attendance book showed that he was 'officially dismissed as per government norms',” the student added. 

In February this year, the dismissed professor along with Samuel Tennyson had taken a group of 50 students to Karnataka as part of a college excursion. During the trip, several girl students complained that the professor in question made lewd remarks about their clothes, harassed them and behaved inappropriately. They also alleged that throughout the trip, Tennyson had abetted Raveen’s behaviour by encouraging him. 
On returning to Chennai, the students complained to the Head of the Department who dismissed their complaints, calling it a 'first time offence' by the said teacher. Later, a petition signed by 30 odd students of the department protesting the college's lack of initiative in addressing the issue caught the attention of the authorities. 
An ICC inquiry was held on the issue, and statements of the students who were subjected to harassment and the accused professors were recorded. On May 24, the ICC released the results of the inquiry which found both the professors guilty. 
"We have not not received any official intimation by the college authorities regarding the professor's dismissal. However, we heard from teachers of the department that action has been taken. Further, the headmaster even confirmed this to the media," the student added.

NZ should be forever proud of their 2019 WC performance: Vettori
Praising New Zealand's performance in the 2019 World Cup final, former Kiwi captain Daniel Vettori said, "They should be forever proud of how they performed." The 40-year-old added there were far more positives than negatives to take away from the final which New Zealand lost on boundary count. "It's the time to celebrate what went right," Vettori further stated.

Times Now
New Delhi: Former New Zealand skipper Daniel Vettori feels the Black Caps should be proud of their journey in the recently concluded World Cup and take the positives of the game ahead. In his column for the International Cricket Council (ICC), Vettori praised both England and New Zealand for showing a good fight in the final of the showpiece event. 
"Both teams were incredible, each had times where they were on top and in control before it was wrestled back, so there were so many parts that you could analyse and deconstruct from the match," he said.
"The New Zealand players will be devastated on their way back home but they should be forever proud of how they performed in the World Cup final," he added.
Further praising the Kiwi players, the spin great said: "Jimmy Neesham did a great job, Lockie Ferguson was in the wickets, Tom Latham played really well with the bat -- there are far more positives than negative to take from this game and the performance."
"The two ties are crazy, but there will be a lot of pride around the performance not only in this game but with the way New Zealand have played throughout the World Cup," he said.
Meanwhile, also lauding England's effort, Vettori felt the hosts were under immense pressure to perform as the tournament was being held in their home.
"They stood up and dominated, they beat the three other semi-finalists in successive games to reach the final and you can't underestimate that type of performance," he added. "It's the time to celebrate what went right and not focus too heavily on what went wrong," he concluded.

Fabian Delph joins Everton from Manchester City for ₹72 crore
Premier League club Everton on Monday signed midfielder Fabian Delph from Manchester City for over ₹72 crore (£8.5 mn) on a three-year deal. The 29-year-old England international who joined Manchester City in 2015 scored 5 goals from 89 matches for the club. Delph has played 20 international matches and was also part of team's 2018 World Cup squad.
https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jul/15/fabian-delph-everton-manchester-city-transfer?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts
The Guardian
Everton have completed the signing of Fabian Delph from Manchester City with Marco Silva convinced the 29-year-old can play an influential role on and off the pitch at Goodison Park.
The England international had one year remaining on his City contract but wanted more regular first-team football having made 20 appearances in their treble-winning season. Everton will pay an initial £8.5m for the midfielder, rising to £10m with add-ons. The former Leeds and Aston Villa player has signed a three-year deal at Goodison.
Delph joined his new teammates at their pre-season training camp in Verbier, Switzerland, on Monday and insists he retains an appetite for silverware despite leaving the Etihad Stadium.
He said: “The club that I’ve been at has had success, especially in the last two seasons, but over the last four years we managed to win trophies. I wanted to be playing more regularly and the opportunity to come and play for Everton Football Club was too good of an opportunity to turn down.
“I’m hungry. I don’t like losing. I see myself as a winner. I’m at an age now where I am probably one of the most experienced players, so hopefully I can bring that and try to help my teammates here to do better. Ultimately, the goal is to win something. I’ve not come here just to be here – I’ve come here with ambitions to win things.”
At 29, Delph does not fit the profile of Everton signings outlined by their director of football, Marcel Brands, although he has stated that allowances will be made for older, good value targets. Silva, however, is keen to add more dominant personalities into the dressing room and believes an England international with title-winning experience can be an important addition.
The Everton manager said: “When I look to bring a new player into our squad, the first thing I look for above all the other things is quality and Fabian is a player with high-quality. But what they can bring to our dressing room is also important and if you can put those two things together then that can only be good for the club. Fabian is a player that can give us different solutions in our midfield because he can play in more than one position and that is important for us.”
Delph is Everton’s third signing of the summer following fellow midfielder Andre Gomes and former Huddersfield goalkeeper Jonas Lossl.

Ex-South Africa footballer Marc Batchelor shot dead at 49
Former South Africa footballer Marc Batchelor was shot dead near his home in Johannesburg. "He was attacked by two men who were driving a motorbike," a police spokesman Col Lungelo Dlamini said. The 49-year-old, who played for South African teams Kaizer Chiefs, Orlando Pirates and Mamelodi Sundowns, was shot in his car.

Daily Mail
A former South African football star who was once threatened by Oscar Pistorius has been shot and killed outside his home in a suspected assassination. 
Mark Batchelor was gunned down by two men on motorbikes as he pulled into his driveway in Olivedale, Johannesburg, around 6pm on Monday.
Police say they have opened a murder investigation. Pictures being circulated on social media show the windscreen of Bachelor's car riddled with bullets.
Batchelor had previously claimed that Oscar Pistorious had threatened to break his legs in a row over a woman, and was present during his court case for shooting dead girlfriend Reeva Steencamp.

Mr Bachelor once accused Oscar Pistorius of threatening to 'break his legs' in a row over a woman (pictured, Mr Bachelor attends Pistorious's 2014 sentencing after he was convicted of shooting girlfriend Reeva Steencamp to death)
Pistorius threatened to break Mr Bachelor's legs because he believed the footballer was sleeping with his then-girlfriend Samantha Taylor (pictured together), it was claimed
Pictures being circulated on social media show the bullet-riddled windshield of Mr Batchelor's vehicle
South Africa has one of the highest rates of gun deaths in the world, with 23 people shot and killed per day on average.
Gun ownership is legal in South Africa, subject to background checks, a competency test, and a police licence.
However, rampant gang violence in cities such as Johannesburg coupled with up to 60,000 lost or stolen firearms, have combined to produce an epidemic of violence.
Many of these weapons and ammunition were stolen from security forces. 
Ineffective policing and corruption within forces is also a major contributing factor, according to a 2019 study.
The former Kaizer Chiefs and Orlando Pirates soccer player said Pistorius made his threat because he thought Mr Bachelor was sleeping with his then-girlfriend, Samantha Taylor.
Investigators say the motive for Monday shooting is not known, and they have not yet identified a suspect. 
Batchelor would regularly sit with Steenkamp's family during proceedings. 
Pistorius shot dead Reeva Steenkamp in the early hours of Valentine's Day in 2013 when he fired four times through the locked door of his bedroom toilet, later saying that he thought she was an intruder.
Former striker Mr Batchelor played for a number of clubs in South Africa , including Kaizer Chiefs and Orlando Pirates.
He is perhaps best remembered for being part of the Pirates team that won the African Champions League tournament in 1995.

As many as 30 of the state's 33 districts are submerged in floodwater and over 52 lakh people have been affected. The state has set up 695 relief camps where nearly 1.5 lakh people have sought shelter.

The situation in Assam deteriorated further on Tuesday 17 July, as floodwaters submerged 32 of the 33 districts in Assam and the death toll increased to 27.
In light of the situation, the Centre has released Rs 251.55 crore grants-in-aid to the State Disaster Response Fund (SDRF) for 2019-20. Meanwhile, the Northeast Frontier Railway as decided to add additional coaches in some trains connecting important cities of lower & upper Assam, for passengers stranded due to floods in Assam.
Altogether 57 lakh people in 4,620 villages are reeling under the impact of the floods that have submerged over 1,53,211 hectares of farm land in 33 districts, Assam State Disaster Management Authority (ASDMA) told PTI.
Two people were killed in a landslide in Kamrup and Dima Hasao district, taking the toll to 17 so far, it said.
The ASDMA report said embankments, roads, bridges, culverts and many other infrastructure have been damaged at various places in Sonitpur, Golaghat, Jorhat, Baksa, Dibrugarh, Nalbari, Hojai, Morigaon, Lakhimpur, Darrang, Nagaon, Kamrup, Barpeta, Dhubri, Majuli, Karimganj, Sivasagar, Hailakandi and South Salmara districts, officials said.
Massive erosion has been witnessed in Udalguri, Barpeta and Sonitpur districts.
Around 15 teams of the NDRF with 38 deep divers, 48 IRB boats and other life-saving aids, have been deployed to tackle the flood situation in Assam.
Meanwhile, flood waters have submerged major portions of Kaziranga, Pobitora and Manas rhino habitats, forcing the animals to take shelter in the artificial highlands for safety.
A release by the Assam Ministry of Forest and Environment on Monday said about 90 percent of Kaziranaga National Park is presently inundated.
Though 155 of the 199 anti-poaching camps of the park are affected by flood waters, the staff and security personnel are discharging their duty using mechanised and country boats, it said.
A special rhino protection force has also been deployed in vulnerable locations of the park.
Around 70 percent of the 46 sq km area at Pobitora Wildlife Sanctuary in Morigaon district has also been inundated, forcing one-horned rhinos to venture into the nearby highlands, a forest official told PTI on Monday, 15 July.
The sanctuary near Guwahati has the highest density of Indian one-horned rhinos in the world at over 100.
Home Minister Amit Shah on Saturday, 13 July, chaired a high-level meeting on Saturday to review the current flood situation in different parts of the country and the preparedness of the States and Central Ministries and agencies concerned to deal with the situation.
Shah directed the National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) and all agencies dealing with flood rescue and relief operations in Assam to remain on high alert so that they can handle any situation arising out of the natural calamity.
Assam Chief Minister Sarbananda Sonowal said Shah has also assured all possible help from the Centre to tackle the floods.
Brahmaputra has been rising menacingly above the danger level across the state, swelling up in Guwahati and overflowing its bank in the Uzan Bazar area, PTI quoted officials as saying on Monday, 15 July.
Sonowal visited flood-hit Nalbari district and the Solmara flood relief camp on Monday.
Even as the NDRF and the SDRF continued their rescue operations, the Baksa district administration sought the Army's help to evacuate stranded people in Balipur Char village, inundated by the Beki river.
The army also rescued at least 160 people during a night operation on Monday in Assam’s Nalbari district, ANI reported.
An NDRF release said the force rescued more than 2,500 people from flood-affected areas in Baksa, Morigaon, Golaghat, Barpeta and Kamrup districts since 11 July.
The swirling flood waters have forced the railway authority to control train services due to “settlement of tracks” in Lumding-Badarpur hill section, Northeast Frontier Railway Chief Public Relations Officer Pranav Jyoti Sharma said.
Heavy rains have affected the train tracks between Jatinga Lumpur to New Harangajao station in Lumding-Badarpur hill section of the NF Railway, he added.
As a result, some trains have either been cancelled or short terminated, Sharma said.

OYO confirms acquiring co-working space provider Innov8
India's most valuable private hotel chain, Gurugram-based OYO confirmed it has acquired co-working space provider Innov8, reportedly for over ₹200 crore. OYO Workspaces is already operational across 10 Indian cities with over 20 centres, comprising Innov8, Workflo and Powerstation as its three in-house brands, OYO said. It added it plans to have 50 OYO Workspaces centres by end of 2019.
https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/16/oyo-workspaces-innov8/?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts
TechCrunch
India’s Oyo has expanded its hotel chain business to more than 80 countries and entered the co-living spaces segment in recent years. The firm, which has raised about $1 billion since last September from several big names, including Airbnb, has now identified a new business to target: co-working spaces.
The Gurgaon-headquartered firm on Tuesday announced Oyo Workspaces, which is already operational across 10 cities in India with more than 20 centres. It currently has the capacity to serve more than 15,000 people. More than 6,000 employees from firms such as Swiggy, Paytm, Pepsi, Nykaa, OLX and Lenskart have already signed up for the service.
At a press conference in New Delhi, Rohit Kapoor, CEO of New Real Estate Businesses, said Oyo plans to have 50 Oyo Workspaces centres by the end of the year and aims to make it the largest co-working business in Asia by the end of next year.
As part of the announcement, Oyo confirmed that it has acquired Innov8,  a co-working startup with more than 200 employees and 16 operational centres. The four-year-old startup was acquired for about $30 million, two sources familiar with the matter told TechCrunch.

Innov8 is one of the three in-house brands that is part of Oyo Workspaces. The other two brands — Workflo and Powerstation — are aimed at people who are looking for economical offering. A user could access one of these co-working spaces for as low as Rs 6,999 ($102) a month. Innov8 has been positioned as a premium option.
India’s co-working space, still a relatively new business category locally, is worth $390 million — a fraction of the $30 billion office and commercial real estate business. Kapoor said Oyo believes it can not only become a market leader in the nation but also expand the size of the market itself. Oyo Workspaces will compete with a range of companies, including 91Springboard, GoHive, Awfis, GoWork and the global giant WeWork.
Oyo Workspaces will offer a range of services across all of its centres, such as a Wi-Fi connection, in-house kitchen, housekeeping, storage and parking spaces. It is also offering users monthly and quarterly passes — currently being offered at heavily discounted rates — to further lower the price points of its co-working spaces.
Oyo, which serves more than half a million users each day across more than 850,000 rooms it operates, is aggressively expanding its business through partnerships with local players as it emerges as the third-largest hotel chain in the world. The six-year-old startup was valued at more than $5 billion at its last funding round, TechCrunch reported earlier.
Oyo, which serves as both listings and reservations platforms, makes most of its money from fee-paying franchises and bookings. Kapoor said the company will use part of the $200 million Oyo has committed to invest in its India and Southeast Asia businesses this year.

UK gives Tata Motors' Jaguar $620 million loan guarantee
The UK government has given Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) a $620-million loan guarantee to support the design, manufacture and export of electric cars. Prime Minister Theresa May made the announcement after a round-table meeting with auto-industry representatives. Earlier this month, the Tata Motors subsidiary announced a new range of electrified cars to be made at a plant in central England.

The Guardian
The government has handed Jaguar Land Rover a £500m loan guarantee to help accelerate its progress in the global electric vehicle race.
Theresa May said the loan guarantee would help Britain’s biggest carmaker sell the next generation of electric cars around the world. She told a meeting of industry leaders at Downing Street on Monday that the funding pot would include £500m from UK Export Finance alongside another £125m from commercial lenders.
The roundtable talks included executives from Aston Martin, BMW, Nissan and Vauxhall as well as energy groups BP, Shell and National Grid.
The companies have agreed to set up a green mobility transition board that will formally bring together government, industry and environmental groups to coordinate plans for a switch from traditional to electric vehicles.
May told the gathering that the government was committed to supporting the UK’s automotive sector and expected it to remain at the forefront of the design and manufacturing of electric vehicles.
She set out a number of commitments to increase electric vehicle use, including plans for England to become the first country to introduce mandatory electric car charging points in new homes. There are fewer than 200,000 all electric vehicles on UK roads.
Under the government’s plans, outlined by the Department for Transport, all new-build homes should be fitted with an electric car charge point to prepare for growing numbers of ultra-low-emission vehicles on UK roads.
The government is also seeking views on how to use “smart” charging technology, which uses algorithms to automatically charge parked cars when electricity prices are at their lowest.
Chris Grayling, the transport secretary, said: “[It is] clear there is an appetite for cleaner, greener transport. Home charging provides the most convenient and low-cost option for consumers – you can simply plug your car in to charge overnight as you would a mobile phone.”
The government said it wanted to end the sale of traditional combustion engine vehicles from 2040 but many – including the Committee on Climate Change – have warned the ban should come into force a decade sooner.
This month Jaguar revealed plans to invest billions of pounds in building an electric version of the Jaguar XJ saloon at its Castle Bromwich factory. The proposals include a major upgrade of the plant, based in the outskirts of Birmingham, safeguarding the jobs of 2,500 people in what is a troubled time for the industry. The carmaker has promised that from next year it will offer customers an electric version of all its models.

Record 5,000 rocket launch attempt marks 50 yrs of Apollo 11 launch
US Space & Rocket Center has attempted a Guinness World Record of launching 5,000 model rockets simultaneously to mark the 50th anniversary of Apollo 11 mission's launch. Apollo 11, which landed Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin on the Moon, was launched at 7:02 pm IST on July 16, 1969. The previous such record included the launch of 4,231 rockets.

TechCrunch

Fifty years ago today, at 9:32 AM ET, Apollo 11 took off from Kennedy Space Center in Florida aboard a Saturn V rocket. At 9:32 AM ET this morning in 2019, you can watch as the U.S. Space & Rocket Center in Huntsville, Ala. attempts a record of its own.
The Space & Rocket Center will play host to a launch of 5,000 model rockets all blasting off at once, in what will be an attempt at a Guinness world record for the most rockets launched simultaneously. It’s a demonstration with sponsors including Boeing, Lockheed Martin  and the United Launch Alliance, which all, of course, manage actual rocket launches with fair frequency.
The model rockets may be small, but 5,000 of anything that’s propelled by controlled explosions into the sky is bound to be quite the show, so keep an eye on the stream above for the fireworks.

Odisha girl breaks silence weeks after gangrape by classmates, 4 held
A girl studying at a degree college in Odisha's Sundargarh was allegedly gangraped by five classmates last month, but she didn't report it. After the alleged incident, she stopped going to college which caused her family to think something was wrong. After being persuaded by her family, she lodged a police complaint on Monday, following which four accused were arrested.

Democracy restored in Thailand as PM declares end of military rule
Thai Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o-cha has declared the end of military rule in the country after he resigned as the head of the military junta. Prayut had led the coup in 2014 and served as junta leader and Prime Minister. He will continue to serve as the Prime Minister with the support of the Parliament.
https://www.reuters.com/article/us-thailand-politics/thai-prime-minister-declares-end-of-military-rule-idUSKCN1UA1D4?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts
Reuters
BANGKOK (Reuters) - Thai Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha formally resigned as the head of the military government on Monday, saying the country would function as a normal democracy after five years of military rule. 
Prayuth stays on as prime minister with the backing of pro-military parties in parliament and a military-appointed upper house under a constitution that critics say stifles democracy and enshrines a political role for the military. 
Prayuth, in a televised address to the nation, said military rule had brought success in many areas, from fixing the problem of illegal fishing and human trafficking, to the rescue of 12 boys and their soccer coach trapped in a flooded cave last year. 
The former army chief who seized power in a 2014 coup, said the intervention then had been necessary to restore order after six months of street protests and violent clashes, but things were getting back to normal after a March 24 election. 
“Thailand is now fully a democratic country with a constitutional monarchy, with a parliament whose members are elected,” Prayuth said. 
“All problems will be addressed normally based on a democratic system with no use of special powers,” he said, referring to sweeping powers the military government wielded. 
Last week, Prayuth used those powers for one last time to end various restrictions on media. He also transferred civilian legal cases from military to civilian court though he retained the power to let security forces carry out searches and make arrests unchallenged. 
King Maha Vajiralongkorn last week endorsed Prayuth’s new civilian cabinet, drawn from a 19-party coalition government that holds a slim majority in parliament. 
Thailand has seen intermittent bouts of political turmoil and violence - as well as two military coups - over the past 15 years as new political forces drawing support from the countryside have challenged the Bangkok-based military-royalist establishment. 
People are generally cautious about what the new set-up might bring. 
“We have to see their work first,” Noppawan Hiranpruk, 47, a market vendor told Reuters.  
“It’s OK to have old faces provided they have new ideas to make new things happen,” she said. 
The new government will officially take power after a swearing in ceremony on Tuesday.  It is due to present its policies to parliament next week.

US Air Force warns as 13L volunteer to storm Area 51 'to see aliens'
The US Air Force has warned that it's "ready to protect America and its assets" after 13 lakh people signed up for a Facebook event to "storm" Area 51 to "see aliens". "[Area 51] is an open training range...we'd discourage anyone from trying to come into the area where we train armed forces," a US Air Force spokesperson said.
https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-7248769/US-Air-Force-ready-protect-America-assets-one-million-join-Area-51-Facebook-event.html?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts
Daily Mail
The US Air Force has warned it is 'ready to defend America and its assets' after more than a million people joined an event to 'storm Area 51'.
The 'Storm Area 51, They Can't Stop All of Us' Facebook event is scheduled to take place on September 20 and has attracted millions of alien conspiracy theorists.
The organisers said: 'We can move faster than their bullets. Let's see them aliens.' 
It's likely few, if any, are actually serious about attending but the US Air Force has still issued a stern statement about the satirical event. 
Air Force spokesperson Laura McAndrews said: '[Area 51] is an open training range for the US Air Force, and we would discourage anyone from trying to come into the area where we train American armed forces.
'The US Air Force always stands ready to protect America and its assets.'
More than a million alien hunters are gearing up to storm Area 51, America's most secretive and secure military base shrouded in extraterrestrial conspiracy theories (file photo)
Fanatics took to social media to share their excitement at the event, with many posting memes and gifs of their hopeful alien interactions.
'We will all meet up at the Area 51 Alien Center tourist attraction and coordinate our entry,' the event description says. 
'If we Naruto run, we can move faster than their bullets. Lets [sic] see them [sic] aliens.'
The phrase 'Naruto run' refers to anime character Naruto Uzumaki, who is known for a running style that has his body tilted forward and low to the ground while his arms are stretched out behind his back. 
The Area 51 Alien Center is a truck stop on US-95, about an hour's drive from the Nevada Test and Training Range - which contains Area 51.
The last known person who went hunting for aliens at Area 51 was shot dead by guards back in January. 
More than a million people have RSVPd that they are 'going' to the event. One attendee posted a map explaining how the group would approach the highly-secure base
The Facebook event is hosted by a 'religious organization' called 'S***posting because I'm in shambles' and a gaming page called 'SmyleeKun'.  'We will all meet up at the Area 51 Alien Center tourist attraction and coordinate our entry,' the event description says
'Area 51' is the codename for the highly-classified remote detachment of California's Edwards Air Base, located 83 miles northwest of Las Vegas. 
It was founded in 1955 as a test site for the Lockheed U-2 reconnaissance plane.  

Since then, however, it has become the subject of numerous UFO sightings and has become inextricably linked in the public's mind with captive aliens and government conspiracies.  
Famous machines developed there include the U-2 spy plane, SR-71 Blackbird, and the F-117A Nighthawk stealth fighter. 
Many conspiracy theorists claim the base has been used to research an alleged crashed alien spacecraft at Roswell, New Mexico, in 1947.
The base was erected in a remote part of the Nevada desert to avoid prying eyes 
What takes place inside the heavy-duty fence at Area 51 has remained a mystery to anyone without high-level security clearance, save for a few photos taken illegally by curious conspiracy theorists.
In 2013 the US government admitted that the base is a secret intelligence hub when the CIA released an official history of the U-2 and OXCART projects, along with aerial photos of the site.
NTTR experienced a rare security breach in January when an unidentified male sped through a checkpoint at the entrance. 
Guards and Nye County police chased him at high-speed for about eight miles before he came to a stop and exited his vehicle. 
He began advancing toward officers with an 'unknown cylindrical object' in hand and did not heed verbal warnings to stop, so security officials were forced to open fire. 
He was pronounced dead at the scene.

Sorry f**k*rs: Boyfriend shares pics after killing Instagrammer
Bianca Devins, a 17-year-old Instagrammer, was allegedly murdered by her boyfriend who shared pictures of the killing on social media. "Sorry f**k*rs, you're gonna have to find someone else to orbit," Brandon Clark wrote alongside a picture shared on gaming website Discord. Clark called 911 to confess about the murder and authorities found him stabbing himself as they approached him.

Daily Mail
Instagram is under fire for allowing a disturbing photo of a slain 17-year-old social media star to stay up for nearly a day after it was posted by a man she was seeing, 21, who is accused of slitting her throat after she had traveled hours to see him. 
The image of Bianca Devins' body was shared by Brandon Andrew Clark, 21, of Cicero in upstate New York, with the caption 'I'm sorry Bianca' at around 6.40am on Sunday. He uploaded it to his Instagram story and also posted it on Discord, a server where computer game enthusiasts chat. 
Bianca and Brandon had been seeing each other for around two months after meeting online and she had gone to meet see him on Saturday. Her family have called him a 'family friend' who they trusted. 
According to a friend of the pair's, they had been at a concert and had gone home where he got angry and stabbed her because he was jealous she had flirted with another man.  
After allegedly killing her in their SUV, Brandon called 911 and threatened to harm himself. When police arrived at his home, he started stabbing himself in the neck in a suicide attempt. 
He was taken to the hospital, Bianca's body was discovered and has now been charged with her murder. 
But more than 12 hours after police found her body, Clark's Instagram story remained active. 
There was a filter on it which warned viewers that it was sensitive content but it was easily bypassed by a simple touch of the screen.  
Only after other users complained was it removed and it had been screen-shotted and shared by scores of users by then. It took even longer for Instagram to disable Clarks' account.  
Brandon Andrew Clark, 21, of Cicero, is accused of killing 17-year-old Bianca Devins, pictured, before inflicting severe injuries to himself in upstate New York. After allegedly slitting her throat, Clark posted a photo of her body on his Instagram story 
Now, the company is under fire for not acting quickly enough. 
It has not addressed the delay but told DailyMail.com on Tuesday: 'We removed this image, and subsequently the account, for violating our policies. 
'To stop the content from spreading, we have technology that allows us to proactively find other attempts to upload the image in question, and automatically remove these posts before anyone sees them. 
'We are also reviewing hashtags and accounts claiming to share this content and taking action in line with our policies.' 
Bianca's family have slammed it as 'disgusting' that people took photos of her body. 
They are begging people to stop sharing them online and have asked instead that they remember her in a positive way. 
'It is absolutely disgusting that people are sharing, screen-shotting the pictures of Bianca’s tragic death!
'I have seen the pictures. I will FOREVER have those images in my mind when I think of her. 
Before he called 911 himself, Clark posted this image of a road from inside an SUV on his Instagram story. He and Bianca had been at a concert in Queens and were driving back to Utica on Saturday night. He slit her throat then tried to kill himself hours afterwards 
Clark scrawled 'may you never forget me' next to his a tarp covering his girlfriend and took selfies of himself with her as police surrounded him 
'When I close my eyes, those images haunt me,' her mother, Kaleigh Nicole, said on Facebook on Monday night.
Nicole Dollenganger, the singer whose concert the pair had gone to earlier, also made a plea with fans to stop posting the photographs. 
'What happened to this beautiful angel was evil, cruel and senseless.
Clark had met Bianca online and the pair were seeing each other for two months before her death. After stabbing her in the neck, he called 911 and told police where they were. When officers arrived, he started stabbing himself in the neck, started filming it on Instagram stories and also posed for a selfie with her corpse which, by then, he had moved beneath a green tarp, according to police. He remains in the hospital 
'I am so heartbroken for her and all her loved ones.
'While I know some of u are very well-intentioned, I ask that U PLEASE STOP sharing the horrific content her murderer distributed.
'PLEASE stop sending them to me,' she wrote. 
The family arranged candlelit vigils for her on Sunday. 
They are also working to stamp out a fake GoFundMe account which is circulating online, asking for donations, which they said they had nothing to do with. 
Instagram declined to say what time the image of Devins' body was removed. 
Devins amassed thousands of followers on Instagram on two different accounts. 
Since her death, chat rooms and internet forums where people claim to have known her have been abuzz with rumor and discussion about her and Clark and how they met. 
They say he 'stalked' her and was obsessed with her profiles. According to Rolling Stone, after killing her, Clark posted on Discord: 'Sorry f*****s, you’re gonna have to find someone else to orbit.'
Orbit is an internet slang term for stalking a woman's social media profile in the hope that she will have sex with you. 
On Saturday, they had gone to a Nicole Dollenganger concert then driven back to Utica at around 10pm. Clark was the driver.  
 
 





 
Instagram came under fire for not doing more to stop the spread of the photos on Sunday and Monday
There was another man with them at the concert but he did not return with them. Instead, the three smoked marijuana at the concert, according to a woman who called herself Chels.
That is when, she said, Clark accused Devins of flirting with the other man and attacked her. 
He then took to Discord and posted a photo of a road on his Instagram story with the caption: 'Here comes hell. It’s redemption, right?' 
After photos of her body emerged online, numerous people called 911 to report it. Police were already trying to find the pair when he called himself.  
After news broke on social media of Devins' killing, users flooded both Clark and Devins' profiles with horrific comments about her death. 
They used the hashtag '#RIPBianca' and re-posted the gruesome image.   
Internet star Bianca struck up a relationship with Clark when the pair met on the internet, over two months ago. 
Bianca was known online as an 'e-girl' and had built up a large following on her two Instagram accounts, @escty and @beegtfo. 
She also frequented gaming website Discord and image board 4chan.
The pair initially communicated over Instagram before meeting in person and developing a more intimate relationship and becoming acquainted with each others families.  
Brandon Andrew Clark known as @yesjuliet on Instagram had his page disabled 
Bianca is shown with her sister, Liv, and her mother, Kim, in an image posted by the family after her deth 
Police arrived at the scene on Sunday morning to find Clark lying on the ground beside a black SUV. 
When the officer approached, he began to stab himself in the neck with a knife. 
The officer requested emergency medical care as Clark then laid himself across a green tarp that was on the ground. 
Bianca's family said she was a recent graduate who had overcome mental health issues
When asked about where the female was located, Clark told the officer that she was beneath the tarp. 
Clark then pulled out a cell phone and took photos of himself laying across the deceased female.
Utica police told BuzzFeed News Clark kept posting to Instagram story while he was being held at gunpoint by officers.   
In a statement released on Monday, Devins' family described her as a talented artist and wonderful young girl who was excited about starting college. 
'She is now looking down on us, as she joins her cat, Belle, in heaven,' the statement reads. 
'Bianca's smile brightened our lives. She will always be remembered as our Princess.
'Your prayers help to strengthen us through this difficult time.' 
The blogger's sister Liv paid tribute to her sister, writing: 'I hate that I have to write this. I hate knowing you're not going to ever come back home. 
'You were the best sister anyone could've ever asked for. Thank you for always being there for me. Thank you for being the best sister I could ever imagine.
'Thank you for always protecting me and sticking up for me.
'I am going to do this for you. Every day I'm going to do my best and I'm going to get through this thing called life and do it all for you.
'Rest easy, I love you so much forever and always.'

England pacer Dernbach retires on day of England's World Cup win
England's 33-year-old pacer Jade Dernbach, who last played an international match in 2014, announced his retirement from international cricket on the day England won 2019 World Cup. The Surrey cricketer said, "I think this is a good time...The team are in a good place moving forward." Dernbach, who made his international debut in 2011, represented England 58 times.

England made history on Sunday at the iconic Lord’s Cricket Ground by bagging their first-ever Men’s World Cup title. It was a long wait for the creators of the game for they had to return empty-handed from the final three times in the past. They then failed to make the semi-finals for 27 long years and when England did again, they ended up as the champions although their Super Over win over New Zealand didn’t look convincing to many.
However, the England fans were ecstatic to see their country eventually win a world title and one player even called it a day on the historic occasion to make his exit from the cricketing world a memorable one. It was Jade Dernbach, a right-arm medium pacer who hadn’t played much for England (24 ODIs and 34 T20Is) but decided to bask in the glory of the Englishmen conquering the cricketing world.

The Surrey cricketer, who is known for his wild celebrations after taking wickets, had last played for England in 2014 and has 70 wickets in international cricket (31 in ODIs and 39 in T20Is) with a couple of four-fors. The 33-year-old cricketer, however, will continue to play for Surrey and will guide youngsters in the club as a senior member. Dernbach, like many other cricketers of foreign origin who had played for England, was born in Johannesburg, South Africa, and moved to England as a 14-year-old.
He made his debut for Surrey against India A at the age of 17 and in 2006, he became the club’s leading wicket-taker and came up with a superlative performance at the Natwest Pro40.
He wrote- “I think this is a good time to announce that after a lot of consideration today I am announcing my international retirement. Thank you for all the support over the years but the team are in a good place moving forward. Looking forward to concentrating on Surrey now.”

In 113 first-class and 144 List A games, Dernbach, popularly called ‘Dirtbag’, has over 530 wickets with 13 five-wicket hauls in all. He got the England Cricket Board’s increment contract in 2011-12 but proved to be an expensive bowler in the ODI series against India. His performance improved in the later stages and he played the shorter formats for England between 2011 and 2014.
Dernbach thanked the supporters for standing by him and said he will continue to serve Surrey.

New Delhi: Air Chief Marshal BS Dhanoa on Tuesday said that the Indian Air Force (IAF) is prepared to fight a Kargil-like war. Days ahead of the anniversary of the 1999 conflict on July 26, Dhanoa also said that the February 26 Balakot airstrikes have shown that the IAF is capable of carrying out precision strikes accurately. 
"Like all good Generals, we are prepared to fight the last war. If Kargil comes again, we are very well prepared," Dhanoa said. He was addressing a seminar in New Delhi organised by the Centre for Air Power Studies (CAPS) to commemorate Operation Safed Sagar, the IAF's operation during the 1999 conflict. 
"In case required, we can do all-weather bombing even through clouds very accurately. We have seen an attack carried out on February 26 (Balakot airstrike) that shows we are capable of carrying out a precision strike from standoff distances and very accurately," he further added.
Dhanoa was the Commanding Officer of 17 Squadron during the Kargil conflict. The Air Chief's comments come days ahead of the 20th anniversary of the Kargil conflict. Meanwhile, in a bid to mark the 20th anniversary of the conflict, the Centre flagged off a poster-wrapped train from New Delhi station to remember the sacrifices made by brave hearts of the Indian armed forces during the conflict.
The train, Delhi-Varanasi Kashi Vishwanath Express, carries pictorial depiction of the bravery of the armed forces. The express train was flagged off by Union Minister of Health and Family Welfare Dr Harsh Vardhan, Minister of State (MoS) for Railways Suresh Angadi and BJP MP Meenakshi Lekhi, news agency ANI reported.
"The message of our bravery and sacrifices of our soldiers during the Kargil War should be reached to every corner of the country. We salute to those who sacrificed their lives for the country. We are proud of the Army," Angadi told reporters. The Indian Army has also planned celebrations between July 25-27 to commemorate Kargil Vijay Diwas.

Need NITI Aayog to turn Uttar Pradesh into Uttam Pradesh: CM
Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath on Monday asked NITI Aayog to prepare a plan to help turn Uttar Pradesh into 'Uttam Pradesh' similar to the Centre's 'Transformation of Aspirational Districts' programme.

Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath on Monday asked the Niti Aayog to prepare a plan, similar to the Centre’s aspirational districts programme, for transformation of every district in his state.
The Centre’s ‘Transformation of Aspirational Districts’ programme aims to expeditiously improve the socio-economic status of 117 districts from across 28 states.
The states are judged on 49 parameters, including human development index, health and nutrition, agriculture, water resources, financial inclusion, skill development and infrastructure.
Chitrakoot, Fatehpur, Bahraich, Shravasti, Balrampur, Siddhartha Nagar, Chandauli, and Sonbhadra are the eight districts from UP, which are a part of the programme.
Attending a meeting with Niti Aayog officials in Lucknow, Yogi said that his government’s intention, from the very beginning, was to turn UP to ‘Uttam Pradesh’ and it welcomed every suggestion made by the Aayog officials.
“The state government will provide all possible help for the same. Once a plan is made, it will be implemented in a time-bound manner,” he said.
Presenting details of the progress of eight aspirational districts, Niti Aayog, Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Amitabh Kant said his organisation wanted the aspirational districts of Uttar Pradesh to be recognised as top among the 115 districts on all major parameters.
Aayog members appreciated Adityanath’s interest in the programme and expressed hope that all the aspirational districts from UP would scale up to the top of every key parameter in the next 3-4 months.
They also suggested that the District Magistrates of the aspirational districts share with them the good work done in their areas.
Chief Secretary Dr Anup Chandra Pandey, Principal Secretary – Information Awanish Awasthi, Principal Secretary to the Chief Minister Mrityunjay Narayan, Additional Chief Secretary and Principal Secretary of the concerned departments also attended the meeting.

Greaves Cotton raises stake in EV maker Ampere to 81% from 67%
Engineering firm Greaves Cotton announced it has raised its stake in Coimbatore-based electric vehicle maker Ampere Vehicles to 81.23% from 67.34%, by investing ₹38.49 crore through primary and secondary share purchases. Mumbai-based Greaves first acquired the 67.34% stake in Ampere in October 2018 for ₹77 crore. Ampere offers a range of low-speed and high-speed electric scooters.

Manufacturer of diesel engines, generators and pump sets, Greaves Cotton has increased its stake in Coimbatore-based electric vehicle (EV) manufacturer Ampere Vehicles from 67.34% to 81.23% by investing an additional amount of  ₹38.49 crore. The said amount is invested in acquiring 25,73,529 equity shares of Ampere Vehicles through primary and secondary purchase.
Mumbai-based Greaves had first invested  ₹77 crore in Ampere in October 2018 and had acquired a stake of 67.34%. According to the company, Greaves’ total investment in Ampere now stands at  ₹120.49 crore (including control premium).
The step, which is aligned with Greaves’ long-term strategy of making a full-scale foray into the electric vehicle domain to capitalize on the government’s push for electrification, marks its activities under phase 2 of its engagement with Ampere Vehicles.
“As part of our next phase of plan for Ampere, we are committed towards building a robust local infrastructure by partnership or standalone investment, possibly in lithium-ion batteries as well, in a systematic manner over next few fiscals," Nagesh Basavanhalli, MD & CEO, Greaves Cotton had told Mint in an interview in May 2019.
The 160-year old engineering company is known to have earmarked  ₹150 crore for its EV foray with funds to be spent on Ampere, its subsidiary, over the next three years.
According to Basavanhalli, post the acquisition of Ampere Vehicles last year, Greaves has steered the EV maker’s market share from 10% to 15% in the electric two-wheeler space. Greaves’ acquisition of Ampere is understood to have given the EV maker access to a larger customer base via its pan-India distribution network of 325 outlets, besides finance and scale.
Basavanhalli had told Mint recently that Greaves Cotton’s initiatives with Ampere under phase 1, which involved introduction of lithium ion battery powered scooters, have resulted in a threefold increase in sales in FY19. Ampere, prior to Greaves’ investments, operated in the low-speed, lead-acid battery powered electric vehicles.

Working on resolution plan without haircut to lenders: DHFL
Dewan Housing Finance (DHFL) on Monday said it was working closely with its shareholders and creditors on a resolution plan that would not need its lenders to take a haircut on its loan exposure.

BENGALURU (Reuters) - Crisis-hit property finance firm Dewan Housing Finance Corp Ltd (DHFL) said on Monday it was working closely with its creditors and stakeholders on a resolution plan that would not require its lenders to take a haircut. 
The statement comes after the shadow bank warned on Saturday it might not survive as a going concern and reported a net loss of 22.23 billion rupees ($324.19 million) for the March quarter. 
“While the sectoral stress is well known for months, DHFL has withstood intense pressure and continues to remain strong and solvent,” the company said in a statement on Monday.  
“DHFL has also cleared significant amount of obligation to the tune of 418 billion rupees since September 2018.” 
Investors dumped the stock on Monday, with shares tumbling as much as 32.6% to an over 10-year low in heavy trading volumes. 
DHFL’s results and commentary on its financial health are the latest sign of growing stress in India’s finance sectors as state-owned banks grapple with bad debts and a recent liquidity crunch in the shadow banking industry. 
The company said on Saturday it expected to restart its business in August and scale it up in the months ahead. 
Sources have told Reuters that DHFL will submit a resolution plan shortly, which may include extending the tenure of loans, converting debt into equity, seeking additional working capital and inducting a new management team and financial investors.

3 bodies found with blood splattered on Shivling in Andhra temple
In an incident of suspected human sacrifice and black magic, three people were found dead with slit throats in the premises of an under-construction temple in a village in Andhra Pradesh's Anantapuramu. Moreover, blood was found splattered over the Shivling inside the temple. The deceased have been identified as the temple caretaker, his sister and a woman from the village.

The News Minute
In an incident of suspected human sacrifice and black magic, three people were found dead in the premises of a temple in Korthikota of Tanakal in Anantapur district of Andhra Pradesh. The three people – Shivarami Reddy who was looking after the temple, his sister Kamalamma, and another woman from the same village, Sathyalakshmi – were found with their throats slit in the under construction temple. 
On Monday morning, the local police found three dead bodies in the Shivalayam which is under construction, as the old temple in the village was demolished sometime back. 
Of the three victims, two were found lying on a cot, and on the ground, in a pool of blood. A  devotee who came to the temple in the morning found the dead bodies and informed the police. 
While the dead bodies were found right outside the temple, their blood was splattered over the Shivalingam inside the temple. 

Speaking to TNM, Kadiri Rural Circle Inspector Madhu said they’re also investigating whether the crime scene was arranged in such a way to throw off the probe. “We suspect that someone deliberately tried to influence the investigation by doing some suspicious things after the murders,” he said. 
Police suspect the three people were killed with sharp objects. A murder case has been registered and investigation is underway.
Kadiri DySP Srinivasulu said, “Unidentified persons have killed Shivarami Reddy by causing heavy injuries on his head, as per preliminary investigation. We have roped in the dog squad and clues teams, we will use all the clues to investigate the case from all possible angles."
An investigating officer also told TNM that they're looking into a “treasure hunt” angle given the abnormality of the crime scene.
In a similar case, a headless body was found in Nallamala forests of Kurnool district earlier this week raising suspicions about human sacrifice.

Byju's valuation hikes $2 bn to $5.5 bn in latest funding round
The valuation of India's most valuable edtech startup, Bengaluru-based Byju's, hiked by about $2 billion since its last funding to $5.5 billion in its ongoing Series F round. The startup has raised over $460 million in the round so far, as per data intelligence platform paper.vc. Byju's had confirmed raising $540 million from Naspers, among others, in December 2018.
https://www.livemint.com/companies/start-ups/byju-s-valuation-soars-by-2-billion-since-start-of-latest-funding-round-1563215113474.html?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts
Livemint
Bengaluru: The valuation of Byju’s surged by $2 billion to $5.5 billion in its ongoing Series F funding round, an unprecedented jump within a single round, as investors clamoured for a piece of the education startup that has reported dizzying growth.
Byju’s, India’s most valued ed-tech company, has so far raised  ₹3,159.4 crore ($460.8 million) in the round, led by investors such as South Africa’s Naspers, private equity firm General Atlantic, and Canada Pension Plan Investment Board, shows data sourced from business information platform Paper.vc.
The firm first raised capital in the ongoing Series F round in December, giving it a valuation of $3.5 billion. In the fourth round in the first week of July, it raised $86 million ( ₹589 crore) at a valuation of $5.5 billion.
Such valuation differences within a round are uncommon. Experts said the valuation jumps are a function of Byju’s rapid growth. Bengaluru-based Think and Learn Pvt. Ltd, which runs Byju’s, grew its revenue threefold in the year ended 31 March to  ₹1,430 crore and turned profitable on a full-year basis.
“It is likely that it is commanding steep increases in valuation on a month-on-month basis, not year-on-year, as other startups might," said Vivek Durai, founder of Paper.vc. “Among India’s unicorns, Byju’s has the highest leverage today vis-a-vis prospective investors."
Its expansion into grades I-III and entry into the US market have contributed to the valuation jump, investors said.
Byju’s is benefiting from Indian parents’ willingness to spend on education to give their children an edge. It has already attracted more than 35 million students, assisting them to understand concepts in maths, science and English.
Byju’s growth is expected to continue as it expands its learning programmes for K-12 students and ventures into new markets.
“Given that in ed-tech there are not too many other large companies available to invest, Byju’s will attract a premium. There are other parameters such as customer acquisition costs, life-time value of users, which is also much higher for Byju’s than other competitors," said an investment banker on condition of anonymity.
There could still be more valuation jumps. In many cases, investors are offered a different set of rights and conditions such as liquidation preference and anti-dilution protection.
“An amount that an investor pays for a stake in a startup or a new-age company could include an insurance premium for certain rights like liquidation preference and anti-dilution protection. The value of these rights could be as high as 20% of the total investment amount with the balance (80%) being the value of the pure equity," said Santosh N., senior adviser-valuation at Duff and Phelps, one of the largest valuation service providers in the world.

Conjoined twin girls separated after 55 hours of operations
Two-year-old sisters Safa and Marwa Ullah, from Charsadda in Pakistan, have been separated at the Great Ormond Street Hospital in London after 55 hours of operations. The rare conjoined twins underwent four operations. "Safa and Marwa have a long road ahead - but we are hopeful they will be able to live active, happy lives!" the hospital tweeted.
https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/jul/15/conjoined-twins-separated-great-ormond-street-safa-marwa?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts
The Guardian
Rare conjoined twins have been separated at a world-leading children’s hospital in London, surgeons have announced.
Two-year-old sisters Safa and Marwa Ullah, from Charsadda in Pakistan, underwent three major operations to separate their heads at Great Ormond Street hospital (GOSH).
The first operation took place in October 2018, when the girls were 19 months old. The last operation, during which they were finally separated, was carried out on 11 February.
The girls, who were born by caesarean section, were craniopagus twins, with their skulls and blood vessels fused together. GOSH has previously successfully separated craniopagus twins in 2006 and 2011.
In order to ensure the operations went smoothly, experts used virtual reality to create an exact replica of the girls’ anatomies. This enabled surgeons to visualise the complex structure of their skulls as well as the positioning of their brains and blood vessels.
A team also used 3D printing to create plastic models of the structures that could be used for practice. Cutting guides were created so that surgeons could work more precisely.
During the surgery, doctors first worked to separate the girls’ blood vessels and then inserted a piece of plastic into their heads to keep the brains and blood vessels apart. Scans had shown that the girls have two distinct brains but these are misshapen, which the plastic and an accompanying pulley system helped to correct.
During further surgery, the girls started to bleed after clots formed in Safa’s neck veins and she began to shunt blood to her twin. Doctors were concerned they might lose Marwa during the operation after her heart rate fell. As a result of her complications, they gave her a key vein that the twins shared. But this had an impact on Safa, who had a stroke less than 12 hours later due to the loss of the vein.
The final major operation involved medics building new skulls using the girls’ own bone. They also used tissue expanders to ensure each girl’s skin would stretch over the top of her head.
The surgery, which was paid for by a private donor, has been followed by several smaller procedures to enable the girls to live independent lives. The operations added up to more than 50 hours of surgery time and involved 100 members of GOSH staff.
The girls’ mother, Zainab Bibi, 34, said: “We are indebted to the hospital and to the staff and we would like to thank them for everything they have done. We are extremely excited about the future.”
The girls, whose father died of a heart attack while their mother was pregnant with them, were discharged from GOSH on 1 July and moved to a London address with their mother, their grandfather Mohammad Sadat and an uncle, Mohammad Idrees. They are undergoing daily physiotherapy as part of their rehabilitation.
Neurosurgeon Noor Ul Owase Jeelani and craniofacial surgeon Prof David Dunaway led the team that operated on the girls. They said in a statement: “We are delighted we have been able to help Safa and Marwa and their family. It has been a long and complex journey for them … Their faith and determination have been so important in getting them through the challenges they have faced. We are incredibly proud of them.
“We are also incredibly proud of the GOSH team responsible for their treatment and care over the past 10 months. GOSH really is one of the few hospitals in the world with the infrastructure and expertise to carry out a separation like this successfully.”
Conjoined twins are very rare – affecting only about one in every 2.5m births.

Court asks Hindu girl to distribute Qurans over FB posts, she refuses
A local court in Jharkhand granted college student Richa Bharti bail for purportedly sharing offensive Facebook posts against Muslims and put a condition to distribute five copies of the Quran to government-owned educational organisations. The court also asked Bharti to present a copy to the complainant. She has refused to abide by the condition set by the court for bail.

The Financial Express
A local court in Jharkhand has granted bail to a college student, who was arrested for purportedly sharing offensive posts against a community on social media last week with a condition that she donate copies of the Quran. According to Hindustan Times, Richa Bharti, a graduation part three student in Ranchi was granted bail from the court of judicial magistrate Manish Kumar Singh. In his order, Singh also asked Bharti to contribute five copies of the Quran to the government-recognised educational organisations. The court also asked Bharti to present one copy of the Quran to complainant Mansur Khalifa.
According to the report, the complaint against Bharti was filed by Khalifa, a member of Sadar Anjuman Committee on July 12, 2019, at Pithoria police station. In her FIR, Khalifa stated that Bharti had posted an objectionable post on both Facebook and WhatsApp. Khalifa further stated that the posts may affect the communal harmony of the society.
Acting on the complaint, Pithoria police arrested Bharti and sent her to jail on Friday. The entire incident drew criticism from some right-wing Hindu organisations, who also held protests on Sunday demanding immediate release. However, the protest was withdrawn following the assurance given by the rural SP Ashutosh Shekhar that Bharti will be released.
Speaking to a local news channel later, Bharti said she was taken aback by the court order and refused to abide by the condition set by the court for her bail. “Today they are asking me to distribute Quran, tomorrow they will ask me to imbibe Islam. Even Muslims post objectionable remarks on social media, have they ever been asked to read Ramayana or Hanuman Chalisa for insulting the Hindu religion?” she told Zee Bihar Jharkhand.
A case was filed against Bharti following a complaint against her by Khalifa over a post on Facebook critical of another post on TikTok mentioning “revenge” for the death of Tabrez Ansari, the victim of the Jharkhand mob lynching incident. The court has asked Bharti to distribute copies of the Quran in the presence of officials and furnish acknowledgment slips before it within 15 days.
In a similar case on June 29, 2019, a Jharkhand Mukti Morcha leader was arrested for sharing an objectionable post on Goddess Durga on his Facebook page. The incident drew widespread anger among several Durga Puja committees and Hindu organisations. The incident took place at West Singhbhum district’s Chakradharpur town. However, the accused Bhuvneswar Mahato later apologised over sharing the post.
On July 14, 2019, the Coimbatore police had arrested Karnataka youth wing secretary of Rashtriya Hindu Mahasabha for sharing a provocative post on the social platform against a particular community.

Married man reported kidnapped found waiting for girlfriend in park
A 30-year-old married man from Noida who was reported kidnapped by his family, was found waiting for his girlfriend in a park on Monday, police said.

"Police parties were carrying out searches for Ravi, who was today spotted in a park in Sector 132," Expressway SHO Bhuvnesh Kumar said.
"During questioning he told the police that he was married but also had an extramarital affair. There was trouble in his family life because of this and that is why he had fled to Rajasthan along with his girlfriend on Saturday after work, the SHO said.
Ravi told police that while away from home, his girlfriend was getting "too many" phone calls from her family who were "very worried" about her so they decided to return to Noida, SHO Kumar said.
Ravi said he had not returned home and had gone to the park to meet his girlfriend when the police came looking for him, according to the SHO. Ravi has been handed over to his family, Kumar added.

India's exports fall for the first time in nine months
India's merchandise exports contracted for the first time in nine months in June while imports shrank first time in four months. Exports fell 9.71% from a year ago to $25 billion, compared with a 3.9% gain in May while imports declined 9.1% to $40.3 billion. Oil imports in June dropped 13.3% to $11 billion, partly due to low oil prices.

Livemint
India’s merchandise exports contracted for the first time in nine months in June while imports shrank first time in four months, signalling that rising protectionism and trade tensions between the US and China are impacting India’s trade prospects as well.
Data released by the commerce ministry showed exports in June fell 9.71% to $25.01 billion while imports dipped 9.06% to $40.29 billion, leaving behind a trade deficit of $15.28 billion during the month.
Comparatively, China’s exports in June fell 1.3%, while imports shrank 7.3%, leading to a trade surplus of $50.98 billion, significantly higher than what analysts projected.
Commerce secretary Anup Wadhawan said the temporary shutdown of ONGC Mangalore Petrochemical Ltd and Jamnagar refinery for maintenance in June adversely impacted exports of petroleum products.
“The shutdown of Jamnagar refinery is likely to abate by mid-July. The fall in the global Brent price by 15.6% in June is also a factor in the declining value of petroleum product exports," he added.
During June, petroleum exports declined 33% while non-oil, non-gems and jewellery exports contracted by 4.86%.

Among other major items, exports of gems and jewellery (10.7%), readymade garments (-9.18%), chemicals (-8.17%) and engineering goods (-2.65%) also contracted.
“The negative growth in June is also consistent with certain global trends, which have impacted India’s exports in recent months. We expect exports growth to revive to the trend growth rate of 2-3% in coming months," Wadhawan said.
The World Bank in its Global Economic Prospects released in June has projected weakening of global trade in 2019.
Global trade is projected to grow at 2.6% this year—a full percentage point below its own previous forecast.
Aditi Nayar, principal economist at Icra Ltd, said lower crude oil prices explain a portion of the contraction in the absolute level of exports and imports.
“Nevertheless, the contraction in imports of items such as transport equipment, machinery and fertilisers should be viewed with caution, as they suggest that the underlying demand dynamics are weak.
The increase in customs duty on gold may curtail imports in the next few months, which would modestly shrink the size of the trade deficit," she added.
The escalating trade war between the US and China, and rising protectionism have cast a shadow on India’s prospects for higher exports.
In March, the World Trade Organization (WTO) projected trade growth to fall from 3.9% in 2018 to 3.7% in 2019. It had cautioned that these estimates could be revised downward if trade conditions continue to deteriorate.
The International Monetary Fund also cut the global growth forecast for 2019 by 20 basis points to 3.3%, the lowest since the 2008 financial crisis, blaming the US-China trade tensions, loss of momentum in Europe and the uncertainty surrounding Brexit.
The commerce ministry is contemplating an export promotion scheme, along with a production-based support scheme, to boost Make in India as part of its 100-day action plan.
The new export promotion scheme may replace the existing Merchandise Export from India Scheme, following the US decision to challenge India’s existing export subsidy schemes at the WTO.

Won't sell my stake in IndiGo: Billionaire Gangwal amid dispute
IndiGo's billionaire Co-Founder Rakesh Gangwal said he won't sell his shareholding in India's largest airline amid a dispute with his partner Rahul Bhatia. "I am focusing on governance issues that have gone awry in this company and I am not seeking any additional control," Gangwal said. Gangwal and his affiliates own 37% of IndiGo while Bhatia's InterGlobe Enterprises controls 38%.
https://www.bloombergquint.com/business/indigo-s-gangwal-says-won-t-sell-out-amid-fight-with-co-founder?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts
Bloomberg Quint
(Bloomberg) -- Rakesh Gangwal, the co-founder of IndiGo, said he won’t sell his shareholding in India’s largest airline and will maintain his stake amid a feud with his partner Rahul Bhatia.
“I am here for the long haul,” Gangwal, who has accused Bhatia of corporate governance lapses, said by phone. “I have no desire to sell my stake or raise my stake.”
Gangwal, teamed up with Bhatia -- a former airline sales agent -- to create IndiGo in 2005, which quickly outpaced rivals to control almost half of the local market, and made both the founders billionaires. Once the chief executive officer at US Airways, Gangwal and his affiliates, own 37% of InterGlobe Aviation Ltd., which operates IndiGo, while his partner’s company holds a little more at 38%. A representative for Bhatia’s InterGlobe Enterprises Ltd. didn’t immediately respond to a request seeking comments.
The primary reason for the fight is the controlling rights held by Bhatia which Gangwal alleges allows his partner to push through related-party transactions in violation of rules. Bhatia’s firm, which has interest in a chain of hotels across India, has said all transactions are executed at an arms’ length basis and in a transparent manner.
“IndiGo has become too big and too critical a company for the country. It is bigger than me, it is bigger than Rahul Bhatia,” Gangwal said. “I am focusing on governance issues that have gone awry in this company and I am not seeking any additional control in the company.”

Winning World Cup will give England confidence in Ashes: Root
England Test captain Joe Root has said that winning the 2019 World Cup will give the team confidence going into a "series like Ashes". "It's what we set out to do two-three years ago and we're halfway there,” the 28-year-old said ahead of Ashes which begins in England from August 1. He added that the atmosphere of Ashes is unmatchable.

Hindustan Times
England’s Cricket World Cup triumph can be the perfect launch pad to complete a memorable double by winning the Ashes series against Australia this year, test skipper Joe Root has said.
Hosts England ended a 44-year wait to win the World Cup as they beat New Zealand side on boundary count after a tied Super Over in a dramatic final on Sunday.
Shifting focus to the five-match Ashes series, which begins on August 1, the 28-year-old said England were full of confidence as they bid to reclaim the urn having already achieved one of their targets.

“It’s what we set out to do two or three years ago and we’re halfway there,” Root told reporters.
“This will give the guys confidence and we’ve talked about taking that forward into a series like that.”
England beat Australia in the World Cup semi-finals at Edgbaston, the venue for the first Ashes test, and Root said they were looking forward to getting back there.
“The way we played against Australia in that semi-final... the guys who were involved relished it and will want a bit more: the feeling of euphoria we felt at that ground,” Root added.
“To potentially be able to experience all that again is very exciting. Ashes cricket always has a different edge to it so that in itself will get everyone going.
“The atmosphere, the way it builds up and the way the guys get excited about it, it’s like no other series in test cricket.”
However, England must ensure their ODI success does not affect preparations, all-rounder Ben Stokes said.
“Everyone here deserves to feel like a champion because we’ve just won it, but when it comes to the Ashes it’s going to be heads on again because it has to be,” Stokes said.
“Whether you’re winning or losing, you’ve just got to wipe the slate clean.”

Facebook hires ex-Vine GM for new experimental apps division
Facebook has hired former Vine GM Jason Toff as the Project Management Director for its recently announced experimental apps division, New Product Experimentation (NPE) Team. Toff left Vine in 2016 and was most recently working for Google as a Partner for its Area 120 incubator, where employees work on experimental projects. Toff will be joining Facebook in next two weeks.
https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/15/facebook-snags-former-vine-gm-to-run-product-for-its-new-experimental-app-division-npe-team/?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts
TechCrunch
Is Facebook  preparing to launch a serious competitor to TikTok? If so, the company just picked up some key talent to make that happen. Last week, Facebook announced plans for a new division, called the NPE Team, which will build experimental consumer-focused apps where it will try different ideas and features, then see how people react. Now, Facebook has picked up former Vine GM Jason Toff to join the NPE Team as a product management director.

Toff’s experience also includes time spent at Google,  most notably as a product lead for YouTube before exiting to Vine  in 2014. At the short-form video app maker, Toff worked as head of Product for a year, then became Vine’s general manager.
Vine, of course, was later snatched up by Twitter — and there, Toff moved up to director of Product Management before boomeranging back to Google, where his initial focus was on AR and VR projects.
Most recently, Toff worked as a partner at Google’s Area 120, Google’s in-house incubator where employees work on experimental projects.
That’s not all that different from what Facebook appears to have in store with its own NPE Team ambitions. Similar to Area 120 or Microsoft Garage, for example, the NPE Team plans to deliver apps that will “change very rapidly” in response to consumer feedback. It also will be quick to close down experiments that aren’t useful to people in fairly short order.
That’s not how Facebook itself operates. Its more experimental apps have had longer runs, as the company used them to gain feedback to inform its larger projects. For example, its photo-sharing app Moments ran from 2015 through early 2019, and its TrueCaller-like app Hello for emerging markets ran for several years, despite fairly limited adoption.
Facebook has also tried and failed with a number of other offshoots over the past decade, like Facebook Paper, Notify, a Snapchat clone called Lifestage and others, as well as those it picked up through acquisitions, then later shut down like tbh or Moves. It also previously ran an internal incubator of sorts called Facebook Creative Labs, which birthed now-failed projects like Slingshot, Riff and Rooms.
Many of these efforts were fairly high-profile at launch, which made their eventual shut down more problematic for Facebook’s image. With the NPE Team — as with Area 120 or Microsoft Garage — there’s a layer of separation between the test apps and the larger company. Many of the apps that the NPE Team puts out will bomb, and that’s the point — it wants to get the failures out of the way faster so others can find success.
While Toff can’t yet say what he’ll be working on at Facebook, there’s a lot of speculation that the NPE Team will try to come up with some sort of answer to TikTok, the Beijing-based short-form video app that sucked up Musical.ly in 2018 and now is a Gen Z social networking hit, with some 500 million-plus monthly users. Toff’s background with Vine could certainly be helpful if that were the case.
Facebook, of course, already tried to get a TikTok clone off the ground with Lasso, but the experiment didn’t take off and the app lead, Brady Voss, left Facebook soon after its launch.
Toff says he’s hiring for the NPE Team, including both UX designers and engineers.

The New Indian Express
NEW DELHI: Nearly 400 terrorists infiltrated into Jammu and Kashmir in the last three years and 126 of them have been killed by security forces, Union Minister of State for Home G Kishan Reddy said in the Lok Sabha on Tuesday.
Reddy said 27 security personnel were killed during the engagements with the infiltrators. Four terrorists have been arrested so far, he said.
"Attempts of infiltration from across the border are mainly in Jammu and Kashmir, which has been affected by terrorist violence, sponsored and supported from across the border," Reddy said in reply to a written question.
There were 143 incidents of infiltration in 2018, 136 in 2017 and the number was 119 in 2016, the minister said.
"Net infiltration in Jammu and Kashmir has reduced by 43 per cent in first half of the year over the corresponding period of 2018," he added. Reddy said the government of India has adopted a multi-pronged approach to contain cross-border infiltration.
This includes multi-tiered deployment along the International Border/Line of Control, border fencing, improved intelligence and operational coordination, equipping security forces with advanced weaponry and taking pro-active action against infiltrators, he said.

Can't tell Speaker how to decide on resignation of MLAs: SC
The Supreme Court on Tuesday said that it cannot say how the Speaker should decide on the resignations or disqualification of the rebel Karnataka MLAs. "We cannot fetter him. The question here is if there is any constitutional obligation for him to decide resignation before disqualification or to club his decision on both," CJI Ranjan Gogoi said.

New Delhi: Hearing Karnataka rebel MLAs case, the Supreme Court on Tuesday said it could not say if the Speaker should decide on the resignations or the disqualification first. (Also read: ‘Cong MLAs Fought Like Tigers,’ Says DK Shivakumar)
It said, “We cannot fetter him.”  CJI Ranjan Gogoi said, “The question is if there is any constitutional obligation for him to decide resignation before disqualification or to club his decision on both”.
The apex court bench of the CJI and Justice Deepak Gupta is dealing with the plea of rebel MLAs who have sought that Karnataka Assembly speaker KR Ramesh Kumar should accept their resignations.
In their application before the bench, the MLAs on Monday sought an impleadment as parties to the pending plea on which it was ordered that the Speaker would not take any decision till Tuesday on the resignations and disqualifications.
On July 12, the apex court had asked the Speaker to maintain status quo. Abhishek Singhvi pleaded with the apex court to vacate the status quo order on MLAs’ resignation saying speaker will complete all the process by Wednesday.
What triggered the plea is a legislative loophole, say reports. Ministers can contest the by-polls and get re-elected in the current House if they resign. But if they are disqualified, they will be barred from contesting for a seat in the current Assembly.
Mukul Rohatgi, appearing for the rebel MLAs, has sought for the Speaker’s decision within a timeframe.

Delhi govt built 23 flyovers in last 4.5 years: CM Kejriwal
After inaugurating the Rao Tula Ram (RTR) flyover, Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal on Tuesday claimed that his government has built 23 flyovers in the last 4.5 years. Kejriwal added, "We believe in doing our work and not indulging in dirty politics." He said that a few more such projects will be coming up before the end of his government's tenure.

India.com
After inaugurating the 2.85 km signal-free new RTR Flyover on Tuesday, Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal, while interacting with reporters, said that his government has built 23 flyovers in the last four-and-a-half years and that many more such projects will be coming up in the national capital before the end of his government’s tenure.
The Rao Tula Ram Flyover, which was built at a cost of Rs 205 crore, is located on the Outer Ring Road and it branches out from the Munirka Flyover and ends before the Army Research and Referral Hospital near Subroto Park which is close to National Highway-8.
“In 15 years, the Sheila Dikshit government built 70 flyovers. In the last four-and-a-half years, our (AAP) government has built 23 flyovers. We do our work, but we don’t advertise much. Now, it is for the people to spread the word about the work we have done in the last four-and-a-half years,” Kejriwal said in his address after inaugurating the flyover.
Asked if more projects were in the offing before the end of his government’s tenure, Kejriwal said, “Yes, a few more such projects will come up soon.”
Work on the newly-built elevated corridor, which will help decongest the area and prove a boon for people commuting towards the IGI airport from south Delhi and Noida, started in November 2014 and it was supposed to be completed by November 2016 but it missed several deadlines.
Hitting out at his detractors, the AAP chief said after the inauguration of the Signature Bridge, a member of the opposition party had sought to take credit for the project.
“We believe in doing our work and not indulging in dirty politics. The Delhi government has worked a lot in education, health and other sectors, and our work will speak,” he said.
In his interaction with reporters after the event, Kejriwal also said that the AAP government not only worked on mega infrastructure projects but also built roads, sewage lines and provided other facilities in unauthorised colonies to reach out to the ordinary people.

Man chained and thrashed by 5 men in Punjab, one arrested

Russian defence system will be fully deployed by Apr 2020: Turkey
Turkish President Tayyip Erdoğan said on Monday that the Russian S-400 missile defence system, parts of which have been delivered to Turkey over the past four days, would be fully deployed in April 2020. "The S-400s are the strongest defence system against those who want to attack our country," he added. US has threatened to sanction Turkey over the purchase.

Reuters
ISTANBUL (Reuters) - Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan said on Monday that the Russian S-400 missile defence system, parts of which have been delivered to Turkey over the past four days, would be fully deployed in April 2020. 
Turkey’s purchase of the Russian system has raised tensions with its NATO allies, particularly the United States, which has warned Turkey that it will respond with sanctions. 
Speaking at Istanbul’s Ataturk Airport on the third anniversary of 2016’s attempted coup, Erdogan said eight planes had already brought parts of the Russian system and more were coming, as he had repeatedly promised. 
“With God’s permission, they will have been installed in their sites by April 2020,” he told the crowd. 
“The S-400s are the strongest defence system against those who want to attack our country. God willing, we are doing this as a joint investment with Russia, and will continue to do so.” 
U.S. officials have said that in addition to being hit with legislation aimed at preventing countries from purchasing military equipment from Russia, known as CAATSA, Turkey could be thrown off the F-35 stealth fighter jet program. 
That would mean it would no longer make F-35 parts or be able to buy the jets it has ordered. 
On Sunday, Erdogan said that U.S. President Donald Trump has the authority to waive sanctions on Turkey for its purchase of Russian air defence systems and should find a “middle ground” in the dispute. 
Tensions between Turkey and Western allies have risen in recent months over the purchase of the S-400 system, with a series of other actions taken by the NATO member state compounding the situation.  
German and Austrian ministers said on Monday that the European Union would endorse a symbolic punishment for Turkey over what it calls “illegal” drilling for oil and gas off Cyprus and threaten harsher sanctions unless Ankara changes tack. 
Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu had said on Sunday that Turkey will continue drilling for gas in waters off Cyprus if the internationally recognised Greek Cypriot government does not accept a cooperation proposal put forward by Turkish Cypriots. 
After sacking the central bank governor this month, citing differences over the timing of rate cuts, Erdogan said on Sunday that Turkey would make serious cuts to interest rates and aims to reduce inflation to single digits by the end of the year. 
In his first remarks since taking office nine days ago, new governor Murat Uysal was reported as hinting at rate cuts, saying there was “room for manoeuvre” in monetary policy. 
Turkey’s benchmark interest rate was hiked to 24% last September to stem a sharp fall in the lira and has remained there to prevent renewed losses in the currency as the economy tumbled into recession. 
Ratings agency Fitch downgraded Turkey’s sovereign rating to BB- on Friday, saying the central bank chief’s dismissal heightened doubt over the authorities’ tolerance for a period of slower growth. 
On Monday, agency S&P Global said Turkey’s credit rating is only likely to be affected by U.S. sanctions if they specifically target the country’s banks.

Farmer held for killing scientist whose body was found in Nazi bunker
A local farmer has been arrested on suspicion of murdering American scientist Suzanne Eaton on the Greek island of Crete. The 27-year-old has reportedly confessed to the murder, with the police saying sexual abuse was a likely motive. The body of Eaton, a molecular biologist, was found by the Greek authorities inside a bunker used by the Nazis during WWII.

Suzanne Eaton (pictured) body was found deep at the bottom of a cave
A man has been arrested for the murder of American biologist Suzanne Eaton. 
He is a 27-year-old father of two, DailyMail.com can reveal.
Police sources said he was arrested over the weekend and has reportedly confessed to killing Dr Eaton. 
Detective believed that only a local person would have known the locality of the hidden cave, which was a former Nazi bunker. 
The detained man is believed to come from Maleme, which is a only a few miles from the hidden 200-feet long cave’s location. 
Sources said police believed the suspect, a local farmer, had a sexual motive.
Dr Eaton was attacked as she walked back to the convention center she had been staying at.
‘He hit her with his car to stop her from running and then stabbed her’ said the source.
Police found him by tracing his cell phone to the area and found his car tracks near the cave.  
Dr Eaton's body landed face down, around 200 feet inside the labyrinth of passages that pass through this cave (pictured)
Local villagers said they believed only somebody from the area would have known about the cave, which is off a dust track and then involves a trek through rugged woodland and is not visible easily to the naked eye or from the road
Police believe she was picked up from the road outside the fishing village of Afrata and suffocated, before being dumped through a shaft into the cave
Dr. Eaton's body was found deep at the bottom of a cave which was used by Nazis to store ammunition during the second World War.
Crete has groups of Nazi fanatics and supporters who trade in memorabilia and souvenirs left behind by soldiers.
Police believe the location of the caves would only have been known to a few around there and particularly those with an interest in Nazi background.   
It comes as Dr Eaton's family pay heartfelt tributes to her.
Her mother, son Max, brother Rob and her sister have broken their silence to remember the 59-year-old scientist who was suffocated and stabbed after going out walking. 
Her mother Glynda said: ‘She was a devoted wife and mother, and dearly loved by her family. 
‘From the day Suzanne was brought to me right after she was born - stuffed into a red Christmas stocking, December 23 - not drowsy and sleepy but with her head up, her eyes alert, that interest in everything around her has never changed.
‘It has been a joy to share her love of books and music, to observe the combination of a certain flamboyancy with a calm, thoughtful, steady personality.
‘Her accomplishments are many and varied: avid gardener, accomplished pianist, black belt in Taekwondo, and of course her contributions to developmental biology.’
Dr Eaton left the Orthodox academy for a run and was discovered in a World War II cave near the settlement of Xamoudochori on Monday nigh
One of her two sons Max added that he would always ‘cherish’ her memory.
He added: ‘My mother was a remarkable woman.
‘She managed to live a life with few regrets, balancing out her personal life with her career.
‘I think the fact that I did not realize how well she had managed to do so was evident that other mothers around me had taken to caring for their children full time, yet mine was never outdone by any of them.
‘Supportive and encouraging, she nurtured and supported anything that the distractible mind of my childhood would come up with, and this curiosity has stuck with me to this day.
‘As I grew, her brilliance as a scientist began to dawn on me. Always armed with a question, she would show interest in any topic broached.
‘Many a time I discussed topics with her that I had studied at university, and within a week, she would be as well versed in that topic as any of my professors.
‘Yet she was far more than a scientist. Her love for music shone brightly, her eyes lit up every time she talked about a piece she was playing, and she would laugh with me in admiration of the sheer complexity of a piano arrangement.
‘I have many fond memories of her and my father playing duets together, filling our home with a beautiful, joyful sound that was unique to them, and I shall forever cherish the memory of lying on the floor, watching and listening to the thing that brought them together.’
Dr Eaton’s younger sister, in a written tribute, said: ‘Sue is too great a person for her legacy to be defined in any way by how we lost her.
‘I can’t help but think that if Suzanne were here, she would know how to write this statement.
‘She was good with words and it didn’t matter if it was a personal expression of grief or joy or a scientific paper on endocannabinoids.
‘She took great pleasure in preparing exquisite meals and had an exotic fashion sense.
‘She loved perfume. She taught and practiced Taekwondo as a second degree black belt. She finished crossword puzzles way too quickly, played concertos, and read extensively.
‘She fitted Jane Austin’s strictest description of an "accomplished woman" while maintaining a natural humility and "insatiable curiosity".
‘She worried that it was impossible to give both her science and her family her all. But anyone who read of her accomplishments in the field of molecular and developmental biology, or who witnessed her joy in tutoring, comforting, and inspiring her children, or sharing with, and loving her husband, would not have suspected.
‘With a deep sensitivity and compassion, she somehow made us all a priority.
‘We are immensely proud of her. It was her words that finally helped me deal with death, and she was in the process of teaching me how to live. So, I will continue on that journey.
‘I have made a conscious decision not to allow those facts to haunt my memory. My memory will be one of pure joy and gratitude, of love and admiration for an arm in arm sister, a closest confidant, a strong, kind, brilliant, selfless human being who made indelible contributions to science and added immeasurable beauty to our lives.
Her brother Rib said: ‘I have lost a sister. The world has lost more than it will ever know. Suzanne brought a new perspective to everything.
‘As a scientist she would pull together the threads of common knowledge from other disciplines to create profound new understandings in her own. As a chef she could make the most exotic dish seem simple and homey.
'I will miss our animated conversations. I would always walk away with a head full of new ideas and enthusiasm. Most of all I will miss the kindest, wisest person I will probably ever know.’  
An 85-year-old gardener and an elderly fisherman have both independently told detectives they saw Dr Eaton in the village of Afrata, which is three miles from the place she had been staying.
Officers now believe Dr Eaton disappeared a mile outside of Afrata as she made her way back to the Orthodox Academy of Crete where she was due to be a keynote conference speaker. 
Police have questioned several people and detained possible suspects, believing they are close to finding Dr Eaton's killer, DailyMail.com can reveal 
She had fought for her life against an attacker armed with a knife, and suffered substantial knife wounds to her body, police sources told ABC. 
The witnesses are adamant she came into the picturesque former fishing village, which does not have street surveillance cameras and is surrounded by cliffs and olive fields, before turning back towards the academy.
The retired gardener, who asked not to be identified, told DailyMail.com: 'I saw her and I recognized her from the photographs of her. I also told police correctly the pink and purple colors of her clothing.
'She was walking quite fast near a bridge and small church on the road out of the village. I was walking and she walked past me. I am sad about what has happened to her.'
It is believed she met her killer or killers on the road out of Afrata and may have become exhausted in the 90-degree heat and through having walked four miles.
She had walked north out of the academy and her body was found about six miles away south of the academy in a cave which had been a Nazi bunker during the Second World War.
It is thought she was picked up from the road outside Afrata and suffocated and stabbed, before being dumped through a shaft into the cave at Xamoudochori. 
Her body had still not been released to her British husband and forensic tests are being conducted to see if she had been raped.
Coroner Antonis Papadomanolakis told local news outlets: 'Her death was not immediate. It is not like in a shooting. There was duration involved.'
One of the last people to see her alive, Katerina Karkala-Zormpa of the Orthodox Academy of Crete, told DailyMail.com: 'She was in a good mood and laughing as she came through the reception.
'She played the piano and then went out. She always felt safe here and it was her fourth visit.
'She felt so comfortable here, she left her room unlocked with the key inside and her belongings.'
'It was a great shock when we heard that she was missing. She used to take walks whenever she was here and I could not believe she had got lost,' Karkala-Zormpa said. 'Her family came here and worked so hard to find her. They were always sending emails and on the telephone and helping the search.
Her body had still not been released to her British husband Tony Hyman (pictured) and forensic tests are being conducted to see if she had been raped 
'It was so sad when her body was discovered but in some way it was a relief because at least they knew what had happened. Of course they wanted to find her alive, but after a week they just needed to know.'
'After she had died, we found out what a brilliant scientist she was and the incredible research she had done. She was very modest and did not make a big deal about her achievements,' she added. 'The whole matter had been very difficult and we hope the killer or killers are found as soon as possible.'
She said Dr Eaton was an experienced and fit hiker and would not normally have accepted a ride from strangers.
Police are also talking to cell phone companies on Crete that the murderer or murderers possibly had on them when they suffocated and stabbed her before dumping her body.
Authorities are trying to establish whether a phone signal was picked up by cell phone masts close to the remote olive fields where her body was found.
Crucially, they have pin-pointed a two-hour period on the night of Tuesday, July 2 when several phone signals were picked up in an area which they believe would have been known to them and few from outside the area.
DailyMail.com previously revealed that officers, in the days after the mother-of-two's body was found, walked around the former Nazi bunker, talking to Greece's three major phone companies, Cosmote, Vodafone and Wind, from their own cell phones.
They talked with the phone companies' technicians and engineers while moving around the woodland and asking whether their locations were identifiable.
This is the Orthodox Academy of Crete where Dr Eaton was hosted while attending a conference and was due to be a keynote speaker 
Katerina Karkala-Zormpa (pictured), of the Orthodox academy, was one of the last people to see her alive and  told DailyMail.com she was 'in a good mood and laughing' before her final run
A source said: 'They did this because they wanted to test close to the cave their own phones and co-ordinates and then with the help of GPS mapping and computer data find out which other mobile phones have been in that area in the last week.
'It is a lonely spot and there is no reason really except for hikers or cave explorers, for anybody to go there.
'If the killers had their phone, they think that is enough to find them.
'There cannot be very many people who go there and if that is the evening her body was left there, they will be looking for the owners of the cell phones picked up in the area during that time.'
Those visiting the area found strong 4G signal strength on their cell phones, boosted by two towering phone masts nearby.
It was also revealed that the killer dumped the body of Dr Eaton, which was still dressed in her running gear, down a shaft, an approximate 40-foot drop.
They did so by removing a wooden pallet from the shaft and dropping the body down where it landed face down, around 200ft inside the labyrinth of passages that pass through the cave. 
Police and forensic officers have carried out a thorough examination of the cave, close to Xamoudochori and their discarded plastic gloves and other debris littered the opening to the cave, which is partially blocked by a fallen tree and accessible only on all fours.

NEW DELHI: Aditya Birla Fashion and Retail Ltd (ABFRL), which owns brands such as Louis Philippe, Peter England and Van Heusen, on Monday said it has acquired a 51% stake in Finesse International Design that retails bespoke ceremonial wear and contemporary apparel for men and women under the Shantanu and Nikhil brand for  ₹60 crore.
The acquisition comes a month after ABFRL acquired ethnic apparel and lifestyle retailer Jaypore for  ₹110 crore. The latest acquisition will help ABFRL expand its presence in the branded ethnic apparel and accessories market covering both bespoke ceremonial wear and prêt lines.
“Indian ethnic wear is a large segment in the Indian fashion market and we have identified it as an important growth opportunity for us," said Ashish Dikshit, managing director, ABFRL. Indian consumers are increasingly seeking contemporary India-inspired designer wear, he said.
The acquisition of Finesse International Design is a combination of primary equity infusion and secondary share purchase, ABFRL said in a filing to BSE.
ABFRL will grow the brand’s existing couture business but also launch new ready-to-wear collections to extend the reach of the brand across more consumer and market segments, the company said, indicating that there could be a more affordable range coming from the brand that has been worn by celebrities such as Kareena Kapoor, Amitabh Bachchan, Serena Williams and Priyanka Chopra.
Finesse was set up in 2007 and runs five stores selling bespoke ethnic wear and contemporary Indian designs by Nikhil Mehra and Shantanu. It owns the brand Shantanu and Nikhil under which it also sells apparel, footwear and accessories. In FY19, it reported a revenue of  ₹35 crore.
“Branded ethnic wear that addresses the aspirations and design quotient of working millennials is a great way of creating expansive growth," said Debashish Mukherjee, partner and head, consumer and retail, India, at AT Kearney. The deal is likely to provide the brand scalability across multiple locations, he said.
India’s domestic apparel industry stood at  ₹5.41 trillion in FY18, growing at an average pace of 13.8% since 2010.

FBI, CIA should investigate Google over links to China: Peter Thiel
Billionaire PayPal Co-founder Peter Thiel has said the FBI and CIA should investigate Google over its "seemingly treasonous" actions over alleged ties to the Chinese military. Thiel, a Facebook board member, suggested that AI developed by Google's sister firm DeepMind should be thought of as a potential "military weapon". Google responded saying it does not work with the Chinese military.
https://www.timesnownews.com/international/article/fbi-cia-should-probe-google-over-china-links-facebook-board-member-peter-thiel/454525?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts
Times Now
Washington: Billionaire investor and Facebook board member Peter Thiel has said Google should be investigated by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) for allegedly working with the Chinese military.
Speaking at the National Conservatism Conference here, Thiel who is a high-profile supporter of US President Donald Trump, said the tech giant has been "thoroughly infiltrated" by Chinese spies, reports Axios.
Google faced the flak last year for its plans to build a censored search engine called "Dragonfly" for China. After internal protests and political pressure, the company put the plan on hold. Thiel asked three questions to Google.
"Number one, how many foreign intelligence agencies have infiltrated your Manhattan Project for AI?
"Number two, does Google's senior management consider itself to have been thoroughly infiltrated by Chinese intelligence?
"Number three, is it because they consider themselves to be so thoroughly infiltrated that they have engaged in the seemingly treasonous decision to work with the Chinese military and not with the US military."
Thiel who co-founded PayPal, then said FBI and CIA must ask these questions to Google.
Google denied Thiel's allegation of links to China.
"As we have said before, we do not work with the Chinese military," a Google spokesperson was quoted as saying.
Trump accused Google of "helping China and their military" in March. The company had then denied the allegation, saying it was "working with the US government".
Top Pentagon officials have also slammed Google, saying its work with China is "indirectly benefiting" the military in that country.
"The work that Google is doing in China is indirectly benefiting the Chinese military," General Joseph Dunford, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told the Senate Armed Services Committee in March.
"We watch with great concern when industry partners work in China knowing there is that indirect benefit," Dunford said.
Google has also decided not to go ahead with "Project Maven" with the US Department of Defense that uses Artificial Intelligence (AI) warfare drone system. Google CEO Sundar Pichai has emphasised that the company will not work on technologies that cause or are likely to cause overall harm.

Canada’s PSP investments partners with ADIA-NIIF for 49% stake in GVK Airport
Canada’s Public Sector Pension Investment Board (PSP Investments) has tied up with Abu Dhabi Investment Authority-National Investment and Infrastructure Fund (ADIA-NIIF) consortium to buy 49% of GVK Airport Holdings Ltd, through a combination of equity and debt, for about  ₹6,000 crore, The Economic Times reported citing people directly involved in the deal.

The stressed airport infrastructure firm had said in April it entered into a non-binding agreement with NIIF-ADIA for its airports business to reduce debt of up to  ₹5,750 crore. With PSP now on board, a final agreement is due to get signed this month. The GVK Group has been selling stakes in various subsidiaries over the past few years to reduce debt of about  ₹24,000 crore and fund upcoming projects such as the Navi Mumbai airport.
Unicorn India Ventures launches  ₹400 crore tech-focused fund
Unicorn India Ventures has launched a  ₹400 crore fund, its third venture capital fund, to back companies at the pre-Series A and Series A stage, Mint reported citing an interview with the fund’s managing partner Anil Joshi. The fund, which has already received commitments worth  ₹50 crore, aims to invest exclusively in business-to-business technology startups, including software-as-a-service, artificial intelligence, machine learning, and Internet of Things (IoT). The new fund’s strategy is also in line with its recent crop of investments, all tech-based and aimed at businesses, rather than individuals. The firm, which was set up by Joshi and Bhaskar Majumdar in 2015, had previously raised a  ₹100 crore first fund. This was followed up with a second cross border fund, Unicorn Ascension Fund, in partnership with London-based Ascension Ventures, with an aim to invest £5 million per year.
Swiggy heads to Korean funds to seek $500 million
Food delivery startup Swiggy is in talks with South Korean funds including Korea Investment Partners, Mirae Asset Management, STIC Investments and Neoplux to raise about $500 million, The Economic Times reported citing two people aware of the development. The financing round, that may be led by Tencent and Swiggy’s largest investor Naspers, is expected to value the company at around $4 billion, up from its $3.3 billion valuation previously. The company may raise both primary capital, along with a secondary sale of shares that is also being worked out. Swiggy’s investment conversations come at a time when it is locked in a discounting war to fend off closest competitor Zomato, with both clocking about a million orders a day. Both have been burning up to $40-50 million monthly to acquire users in a cash-guzzling sector that has been reliant on discounting to ratchet up growth.
Tata Sons to raise $500 million via offshore loans
Tata Sons is looking to raise $500 million in the first tranche of its scheduled offshore borrowings, the proceeds from which will likely be used to fund multiple ongoing expansion and restructuring plans, The Economic Times reported citing three people with knowledge of the matter. The loan, which may be priced after adding 115 basis points over and above the London Interbank Offered Rate, would mature in three or four years. The proceeds from the borrowing, according to one of the persons ET quoted, would be used to refinance Tata Sons debt, as opposed to earlier when the refinancing was done through domestic borrowings. Tata Sons will continue to tap the foreign loan market to raise an estimated $2.5 billion as part of the group’s financing strategy. Eight global lenders, including Standard Chartered Bank, DBS Bank, MUFG, Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation (SMBC) and Scotiabank, are expected to syndicate this loan.

India’s third largest commercial vehicle manufacturer, Ashok Leyland said it is shutting down its Pantnagar facility for 9 days this month in response to weak demand outlook in the domestic market.
In a BSE filing today, the CV maker said its Pantnagar plant will remain closed from July 16, 2019 to July 24, 2019 (both days inclusive), owing to weak demand and outlook for the industry.
According to the data released by the industry body, Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers (Siam), total CV production in June was hit with a downfall of 23.39% year-on-year at 69,496 units. Ashok Leyland’s CV production in June stood at 12,690 units, down 21.35% YoY.
On the other hand, the company’s domestic factory dispatches last month stood at 12,085 units thereby posting a decline of 14.24% y-o-y.
For Q1 FY20, it recorded a decline of 9% y-o-y on its total CV production, which stood at 43,660 units. In comparison, the CV industry’s cumulative production saw a decline of 14.5% for the June quarter.
Ashok Leyland’s plant shut down plan comes at a time when many major automakers such as Tata Motors, Mahindra and Mahindra (M&M), Maruti Suzuki and others too have resorted to temporarily shutting down their respective plants as an inventory correction measure.
“While the pre-buy in FY20 on account of the introduction of BS VI from next year could provide the surge in demand in the second half of this year, it is important that the government and the industry bodies consultatively provide a long-term direction or a policy guideline to the auto sector that include policy announcements such as vehicle scrappage, cab code or bus body code," said Dheeraj G Hinduja, chairman, Ashok Leyland in the company’s recently released annual report.

Ex-Malaysia PM spent ₹5.5 cr on jewellery in 1 day, court hears
Ex-Malaysia PM Najib Razak used his credit cards to buy goods worth over ₹5.5 crore at a jewellery shop in a single day in 2014, prosecutors told a court during his corruption trial. The credit card bills were presented as evidence against Razak, who allegedly diverted over ₹4,804 crore from the state-run 1MDB wealth fund to his personal bank accounts.
https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jul/16/800000-spent-jeweller-one-day-najib-razak-credit-cards-malaysia-court-hears?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts
The Guardian
Credit cards belonging to the disgraced former prime minister of Malaysia were used to spend more than $800,000 at a jeweller in Italy in a single day, a court in Kuala Lumpur has heard during his corruption trial.
The spending spree took place at De Grisogono, a Swiss luxury jeweller, in Italy on 8 August 2014 where items worth 3.3m Malaysian Ringgit ($803,000 or £645,000) were purchased on Najib Razak’s Visa and Mastercard platinum credit cards, the court was told.
A few months later, 466,000 Malaysian Ringgit ($108,000) was spent at a Chanel boutique in Hawaii and 127,000 Malaysian Ringgit at Bangkok’s luxury Shangri-La hotel using the same credit cards. All the payment were made from Najib’s Ambank account, prosecutors said.
The credit card bills were presented as evidence in the trial of the former Malaysian prime minister, who was toppled from power in May last year and is now facing dozens of charges for corruption, misappropriation of funds and abuse of power linked to government fund 1MDB.
The trial, relating to the misuse of a subsidiary fund called SRC, is the first of several that Najib is due to face in the coming months for his alleged role in the scandal.
Under Najib’s watch, it is alleged upwards of $4bn was embezzled from 1MDB and spent around the world, funding films, yachts, real estate and celebrity parties. It is alleged $681m (£516m) went into Najib’s personal bank account and was used to fund the lavish spending habits of Najib and his wife Rosmah Mansour. Najib and Rosmah, who is also facing multiple charges, both deny all wrongdoing.
The opulent lifestyle of Najib and Rosmah was a source of much resentment in Malaysia during Najib’s time as prime minister and after their arrest there was a collective revulsion when raids on the couple’s family properties uncovered a cache of luxury goods worth $273m, including 1,400 necklaces, 567 handbags, 423 watches, 2,200 rings, 1,600 brooches and 14 tiaras, the biggest seizure in Malaysian history.
Najib defended the credit card spending as purchases for official purposes. “This spending is for gifts to a senior member of the royalty of a government and their entourage that has good relations with our country,” Najib wrote in a Facebook post late on Monday. He did not clarify which royal had received the jewellery. “It is a norm to give gifts to leaders of other governments.”

London Mayor rejects billionaire's plan for 1000-ft 'Tulip' tower
London Mayor Sadiq Khan on Monday rejected a proposal by Brazilian billionaire Joseph Safra to build a 1,000-foot tulip-shaped skyscraper. Design of 'The Tulip' was deemed not to be good enough for such a prime location. "The tower would result in harm to London’s skyline and impact views of the nearby Tower of London world heritage site," Khan's office said.

The Guardian
Plans to build a 300-metre (1,000ft) skyscraper dubbed “the Tulip” in the City of London near the Thames have been thrown out by the capital’s mayor, Sadiq Khan.
The building, designed by Norman Foster’s architectural practice, would have been the second tallest in western Europe, but its design was deemed not to be good enough for such a prime location.
The project’s backers had said it would attract 1.2 million visitors a year but its detractors worried it would damage some of London’s most recognisable historical views.
The scheme had initially received the go-ahead but Khan dashed the hopes of its designers, Foster + Partners, on Monday. “The mayor has a number of serious concerns with this application and having studied it in detail has refused permission for a scheme that he believes would result in very limited public benefit,” Khan’s spokesman said.
“In particular, he believes that the design is of insufficient quality for such a prominent location, and that the tower would result in harm to London’s skyline and impact views of the nearby Tower of London world heritage site. The proposals would also result in an unwelcoming, poorly designed public space at street level.”
The chief executive of Historic England, Duncan Wilson, had expressed similar concerns when the City of London Corporation (CoLC) approved the plans in April.
“This building, a lift shaft with a bulge on top, would damage the very thing its developers claim they will deliver – tourism and views of London’s extraordinary heritage,” Wilson said.
“The setting of the Tower of London, a symbol of the city not just to millions of Londoners but to the whole world and one of our most visited places, will be harmed. It has already been damaged by the Walkie Talkie and it would be a great shame if that mistake was repeated.”
But the CoLC described it as a “truly unique visitor attraction” that would help the City, which is relatively quiet on weekends, attract more visitors.

Grofers raises $10 mn from Abu Dhabi's Capital Investments
Gurugram-based online grocery delivery startup Grofers has raised $10 million from Abu Dhabi's Capital Investment in its ongoing $200-million Series F round, as per regulatory filings accessed by paper.vc. The SoftBank-backed startup raised $130 million from its parent entity. Founded in 2013 by Albinder Dhindsa and Saurabh Kumar, Grofers has raised nearly $472 million to date, as per Crunchbase.
https://www.financialexpress.com/industry/sme/grofers-pumps-additional-capital-in-series-f-round-even-as-bigbasket-amazon-flipkart-heats-up-competition/1644486/?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts
The Financial Express
SoftBank-backed online grocery venture Grofers, which announced $200 million in Series F round in May this year, has added modest $10 million to the existing round from Abu Dhabi-based Capital Investment LLC even as competition in the digital grocery segment continues to heat up with its bigger rival BigBasket turning unicorn in March this year apart from Flipkart and Amazon looking at grocery to ramp up their growth.
Capital Investment LLC, which “appears to be an investment vehicle of the UAE based Abu Dhabi Investment Group,” has received 1.9 lakh Series F shares, according to the regulatory filing sourced from business signals platform Paper.vc.
“Even while the ticket size remains small, it is interesting because it indicates a possible renewed interest in direct investments by Arab capital in the India growth story,” Vivek Durai, Founder, Paper.vc told Financial Express Online.
Grofers had raised $200 million round led by SoftBank Vision Fund, South Korean fund KTB Ventures and existing investors Tiger Global, Sequoia Capital.
Comments from Grofers based on the email sent for this story will be updated as and when received.
The valuation of the company, however, has remained the same — around $497 million from its Series F round, Durai said in a separate note.
Importantly, from the Series F round of $200 million, “only $130 million appears to have been received by its Singapore-based parent company — Grofers International,” he added.
Grofers is already working on converting around 200 brick-and-mortar stores into its own branded outlets in coming months to grow business via its private label. The company has already converted around 100 such stores, PTI had reported earlier this month.
“We are still going to offer more of our own products. The additional capital will be used to create more warehouses. We are working with more small businesses and manufacturers. We want to bring warehousing closer to where they are,” Albinder Dhindsa, co-founder and CEO of Grofers, had told FE.
Bigbasket had added more than Rs 1,000 crore in revenue in FY18 to Rs 1,605 crore from Rs 580 crore in FY16 in comparison to merely around Rs 40 crore added by Grofers to its FY16 revenue of Rs 14.3 crore to take it to Rs 53.5 crore mark in FY18, as per legal filings sourced by Paper.vc.
Also, while BigBasket has so far raised $989.5 million in 13 rounds, Grofers has secured $461 million (excluding latest funding) in seven rounds, as per deals tracker Crunchbase.
On the other hand, Amazon has earmarked “$500 million (that) are committed mostly to agriculture, farmers and farm-to-fork,” Amit Agarwal, Senior Vice-President and Country Head, Amazon India, told ET Now recently.
India’s digital grocery segment was worth $2 billion last year and is expected to grow to $5 billion by 2020 as with increasing digital adoption, demand and supply levers will converge to boost sector’s growth, according to consulting firm RedSeer.
Businesses are realigning their business model and focusing on warehousing capabilities in areas of high demand to offer better product availability and delivery experience, as per RedSeer.

Patna (Bihar) [India], July 16 (ANI): Opposition leaders, including Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) leader Rabri Devi, on Tuesday protested outside the state Assembly alleging inaction by the government in dealing with the grim flood situation. Holding placards and posters against Chief Minister Nitish Kumar-led government, leaders raised slogans like 'Bihar wants justice', 'No rest, no relief', 'No rescue, no rest', 'Is Nitish-Modi government sleeping?'The protestors urged the government to set up relief camps in the deluge-affected areas of Bihar.One of the leaders said, "We have staged this demonstration today to seek attention of the state government as well as the Centre towards the floods in Bihar."
"The flood has affected 13 districts of Bihar. The people are displaced from their homes and they are taking shelter on embankments. No relief camp has been provided to flood victims. Rescue operations are not being conducted properly. Nobody is there to averse the flood situation," he alleged.In contrast to opposition's claim, government officials on Monday said that around 19 NDRF teams were deployed in Araria, Bettiah, Darbhanga, Didarganj, Gopalganj, Katihar, Madhubani, Motihari, Muzaffarpur, Sitamarhi and Supaul to tackle flood-like situation developed in low-lying areas due to heavy rainfall, officials said.
So far, NDRF teams have evacuated more than 3,310 people to safer places.On July 14, Bihar Chief Minister had called a delegation comprising officials to make adequate arrangements for setting up of camps and keep in touch with the people, an official statement had said.(ANI)

No plan to replace New Pension Scheme with old scheme: Govt
State Finance Minister Anurag Thakur on Monday informed the Lok Sabha that there is no proposal to replace the New Pension Scheme (NPS) with the old pension scheme for central and state government employees recruited since 2004. Employees have been demanding the old pension scheme as it was based on a fixed pension amount and provided more security upon retirement.

New Delhi: The Centre ruled out any possibility of replacing the new pension scheme (NPS) with the old pension scheme (OPS) that was in force before 2004. In a written reply to a question in this regard, Minister of State for Finance & Corporate Affairs Anurag Thakur said, “There is no proposal to replace the NPS with old pension scheme in respect of Central Government employees recruited on or after 01.01.2004.”
No OPS due to rising and unsustainable pension bill

NPS does not provide a guaranteed pension

NPS mandatory for  employees joined on or after Jan 1, 2004
There has been a demand from several quarters, including trade unions and pressure groups, to reintroduce the ops as it provides more security to the retired employees than the new one. However, the government category denied all speculations, citing the reasons “due to rising and unsustainable pension bill, the Government had made a conscious move to shift from the defined benefit, pay-as-you-go pension scheme to defined contribution pension scheme now called as National Pension System (NPS). The transition also helped in freeing the limited resources of the Government for more productive and socio-economic sectoral development.”
The NPS based on the contribution of the employees was introduced in 2004 and since then it has been facing opposition as employee unions of central and state governments find the OPS better as it was based on fixed pension amount.
The biggest point of opposition to the NPS is that it doesn’t provide guaranteed pension to its subscribers and the unsustainable pension bill on the exchequer is the main reason the government doesn’t want the OPS back.
All government employees who joined the service on or after January 1, 2004, fall under the NPS based on the defined contribution with two tiers – Tier-I and II. Contribution to Tier-I is mandatory for all Government servants (except the armed forces in the first stage), whereas Tier-II will be optional and at the discretion of Government servants.

RTR flyover to reduce traffic jams on way to airport opens in Delhi
After almost a three-year delay, the Rao Tula Ram (RTR) flyover opened on Tuesday to reduce traffic jams on the way to the IGI airport from South and East Delhi and Noida. The flyover on Outer Ring Road will also smoothen the journey to Gurugram. The flyover branches out of Munirka flyover and ends before Army Research and Referral Hospital.
https://www.livemint.com/news/india/delhi-rtr-flyover-opens-to-ease-connectivity-to-gurgaon-igi-airport-5-things-to-know-1563264823472.html?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts
Livemint
New Delhi: The long-delayed, Rao Tula Ram (RTR) flyover was opened by Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal today. With the elevated road now thrown open to the public, commuting to the Delhi domestic and international airport terminals from South and East Delhi and Noida will become easier. The flyover on Outer Ring Road will also smoothen the journey to Gurgaon. After inaugurating the flyover, Arvind Kejriwal tweeted, “Congratulations Delhiites. Overcoming all hurdles your govt finally succeeds in opening the RTR flyover from today. No more traffic jams on your way to the airport."
Five things to know about the newly inaugurated Rao Tula Ram (RTR) flyover:
1) The newly constructed 2.7 km flyover branches out of Munirka flyover and ends before Army Research and Referral Hospital near Subroto Park close to National Highway-8.

2) The construction of the elevated road was started in November 2014. It was to be completed by November 2016, but missed several deadlines.

3) The opening of the three-lane elevated road will be a great relief for the motorists from South Delhi areas like Munirka, Hauz Khas, Greater Kailash and Noida, who will be able to ditch the already clogged Outer Ring Road to reach the Indira Gandhi International (IGI) Airport.
4) It has been built at a cost of around  ₹310 crore due to the repeated delays to the project for several reasons.
5) The flyover was part of a larger plan to decongest the busy Vasant Vihar, South Campus and Moti Bagh corridors. The other part of the project, the construction of an underpass linking South Campus with San Martin Road in Chanakyapuri, is now expected to be completed later this year as major hiccups have been cleared.

The 46-day cricketing carnival, the ICC Cricket World Cup 2019, provided the fans with the best possible entertainment. The 45 league matches and then the 4 knockout encounters were all great fun to watch. While rain played spoilsport on a few instances, it was a treat whenever there was action. While some games were highly one-sided, a few others were absolute thrillers just like the final which England managed to win by a whisker.
Also, this edition of the World Cup witnessed a $10 million prize pot. The winner would be awarded $4,000,000 prize money, which is the highest till date. Also, the runners and the semi-finalists were rewarded handsomely. While the team that came second got $2,000,000 as prize money, the other two teams in the top-four were awarded $800,000 each. Moreover, the winner of each league game was awarded an incentive of $40,000 while the remaining six teams got $100,000.
Afghanistan had a tournament to forget. The Asian team, before the tournament started, was expected to upset some of the big teams. A few experts even predicted that they’d enter into the semi-final. But the change of captaincy, poor execution of plans and inexperience didn’t help their cause.
The Afghans came close to a win on a few occasions. They could have defeated teams like Windies, Pakistan and India. However, their efforts weren’t really sufficient. The team lost all the nine games that it played in the World Cup 2019 and thus they get only $100,000 as their prize money.

Facebook's cryptocurrency Libra could be used for terrorism: US
The US Treasury Department has said it has "very serious concerns" that Facebook's upcoming cryptocurrency Libra could be misused for terrorism and money laundering. Labelling the digital currency as a "national security issue", the department added, "Our overriding goal is to maintain the integrity of our financial system and protect it from abuse." Facebook announced the cryptocurrency in June.

The US government views cryptocurrencies, including Facebook-backed Libra, as a national security issue. In a press conference today, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said the Treasury Department has "very serious concerns" that Libra could be misused by money launderers, terrorist financiers and other bad players. While the concerns are not entirely surprising, they do make the US government's stance on cryptocurrency more than clear.
According to Mnuchin, the US has been at the forefront of regulating entities that provide cryptocurrencies. It has also seen cryptocurrencies exploited to support illicit activities including cyber crime, tax evasion, extortion, ransomware, human trafficking and more. Still, Mnuchin said the US "welcomes responsible innovation, including new technologies that may improve the efficiency of the financial system and expand access to financial services."
"With respect to Facebook's Libra and other developments in cryptocurrencies, our overriding goal is to maintain the integrity of our financial system and protect it from abuse," Mnuchin said. He noted that Facebook (and any other cryptocurrency providers) will have to meet the same safeguards as traditional financial institutions, including those put in place by the Anti-Money Laundering Council, Financial Crimes Enforcement Network and Bank Secrecy Act.
That should come as no surprise to Facebook. While it's likely prepared to meet those standards, it will have to navigate pushback like this from the Treasury Department and the President himself, who claims cryptocurrencies are "highly volatile and based on thin air." Some lawmakers have called for Facebook to halt Libra's development, and others want to block all big tech companies from providing cryptocurrencies. Facebook is scheduled to testify at a Senate hearing tomorrow, and it has said it won't launch Libra until all of the regulatory issues are addressed.

Earlier this month, the Prime Minister made his views clear that the BJP was keeping a close watch on the attendance of the party’s members of Parliament, who had been skipping sittings or its debates, in the House and its many panels. 
Modi had also talked about lax attendance by linking it to promotions. He told the BJP leaders that he went through attendance records, interventions, questions and how MPs interacted in parliamentary committees. 
“I rank everyone according to all this and then decide the ministers,’’ Modi said at the BJP’s parliamentary party meeting on July 2.

The police have arrested two Rohingyas from Tripura near the India-Bangladesh International Border on Tuesday.

AGARTALA: Two Rohingyas have been arrested from near the India-Bangladesh international border in Tripura, police said Tuesday.
Acting on a tip-off, the police arrested 21-year-old Md.
Salim and 20-year-old Jahangir Alam from Rajnagar area near here in West Tripura district on Monday, after locals claimed that two suspected Rohingya Muslims were roaming there.
"It was found during a preliminary investigation that they had entered Indian territory from Bangladesh in search of jobs," officer-in-charge of Battala police station, Sahadeb Bhowmik, said.
Refugee cards were recovered from their possession and they confessed of having stayed at a Rohingya refugee camp in Bangladesh's Chittagong area, he added.
The duo would be produced at a local court Tuesday.
Rohingyas use the Tripura corridor of the India- Bangladesh border to enter India from the neighbouring country, BSF officials said.
In October 2017, the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) had ordered all state governments to identify and monitor Rohingya refugees.
It said the Centre viewed infiltration of Rohingyas from the Rakhine state of Myanmar into Indian territory as a burden on the country's resources and it aggravated security challenges to the country.
Thousands of Rohingya Muslims, described by the UN as the most persecuted minority in the world, fled their homes in 2017 to escape an alleged crackdown by the Myanmarese military.

I had to live on beaches, sleep on platforms: Kher on struggling days
Speaking about his struggling days in Mumbai, Anupam Kher revealed, "At one point I had no work, money or help. I had to live on beaches and sleep on platforms." He added that he soon got a role in Mahesh Bhatt's film but was replaced. However, he was signed when Bhatt "saw the vigour with which he wanted to act".
https://www.timesnownews.com/entertainment/news/bollywood-news/article/i-had-to-live-on-beaches-sleep-on-platforms-anupam-kher-on-struggles-that-turned-his-dream-into-reality/454341?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts
Times Now
Goes without saying, Anupam Kher is one of the finest actors we have in the industry. He is an inspiration in more ways than one. With over 500 films not just in Bollywood but across cinema and theatre, Anupam Kher has created a legacy that is par excellence. And what's phenomenal is how he continues to work and perform with utmost determination even today, at the age of 64. After all, isn't age just a number?
And while Anupam Kher continues to set such a bright example for the youth, it is only important for everyone to know his story and the hurdles that he has overcome with hardwork and confidence to achieve his dreams. In interaction with Humans Of Bombay, Anupam Kher narrates his story stating, "When I was young, I asked my grandfather why we were so happy despite being poor. He said, ‘Happiness is our cheapest luxury’. My dad was very optimistic–when I ranked 59 out of 60 in school, he said I could always do better next time! It was this celebration of failures that made me unstoppable", he narrates adding how there were several instances when he was forced to give up but he didn't... 
Mentioning how there were days when he had no house, no money, Anupam Kher said, "I got my calling when I acted in a play in 9th grade. I couldn't say my lines well, so they were given to someone else. But during the play, he forgot to say them! So I made something up in my broken English–the audience was in splits!  I loved being on stage & wanted to act full time. I saw an Ad for a course in Chandigarh & needed Rs.100 for the audition. I stole it from my mom & told her I was going for a picnic. Thankfully, I was accepted! So I went to Chandigarh to study acting. I was a teacher for 2 years, before I saw an ad that a drama school in Mumbai was hiring. When I got here, I realised they had no money–they gave me a small space to teach & a tiny room to stay. I didn’t want to go back a failure. So I taught there, while auditioning & performing in plays. It was hard–at one point I had no work, money or help. I had to live on beaches & sleep on platforms. I didn’t want to worry my parents, so I wrote to my granddad that I wanted to come back. But he replied, ‘A man who’s already drenched in water, shouldn’t be scared of rains’–I didn’t give up!"
 
 
Explaining how a film changed his life despite having lost it to someone else, he said, "It’s good that I didn't, because soon, I got a role in a Mahesh Bhatt film. I got money & a place to stay. But later, I was told I was replaced. I called Mahesh Bhatt & he said it was true. I couldn’t take it & decided to go home. But first, I met Mahesh Bhatt & told him no one would play the part better than me–he was making a mistake. So he told the producers he wouldn’t make the film without me–he saw the vigour with which I wanted to act. That’s how I got my first film. Today I’ve done over 500 films. It’s been a bumpy ride, but everyday, I thank my failures for bringing me this far. I thank all the people who said no to me, all the people who didn’t help me–because if it weren’t for them I wouldn’t have pushed myself to get where I am today…a place where my dreams are now my reality."
Anupam Kher was recently seen in One Day: Justice Delivered, a film that received immense praises from critics and audiences alike.

Right time for Rohit to become ODI captain: BCCI functionary
Amid rumours of a rift between captain Virat Kohli and vice-captain Rohit Sharma, a BCCI functionary said the board is mulling split captaincy. "This would be the right time for Rohit to take over ODI captaincy. We all know some areas need a re-look," he added. He further said that the board will get to bottom of the rumours.

Hindustan Times
Ever since India’s ouster in the semi-final of the ICC World Cup, there has been a lot of talk about the areas where the team lacked and also how it was too reliant on the duo of skipper Virat Kohli and his deputy Rohit Sharma when it came to scoring runs. While this has been an area that is also highlighted from the scoring charts of the World Cup, another factor that the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) is also keen to discuss is the idea of split captaincy.
Speaking to IANS, a board functionary said that good teams start preparations immediately after one campaign ends and the biggest result of that is England winning the World Cup on Sunday. So, keeping an eye on the next campaign, India too could look at the option of having Rohit lead the team in the shorter format while Kohli continues in Tests.

“This would be the right time for Rohit to take over the mantle of the captaincy in the 50-over format. There has been immense support to the present captain and the management and it is time to plan ahead for the next World Cup and for that the existing ideas and plans need a fresh look. We all know some areas need a re-look. Rohit would be the right man for the job,” the functionary said.

But as per the functionary, the biggest concern that has come up post the exit is the talks of different camps and rumours of a rift between the Kohli and Rohit. That could be detrimental for Indian cricket as the team looks to move forward and the matter is set to be discussed when the review meeting takes place with coach Ravi Shastri, captain Kohli and chief selector M.S.K. Prasad in the presence of the Committee of Administrators (CoA).

“You are aware that Vinod Rai (CoA chief) has already mentioned that a review meeting will take place. This will have to be ascertained when the review takes place and it is important to get to the bottom of these rumours,” the functionary added.
While Rai has claimed that a review meeting will take place to assess the performance of the team, there are clearly more problem areas that need immediate attention. 
Interestingly, the last time there was a meeting where the CoA members had met the senior players and coach -- during the Test against West Indies in Hyderabad last year -- Kohli and Rohit’s difference of thought was visible when it came to resting players in the IPL keeping the World Cup in mind.

India squad for West Indies tour to be announced on July 19
India squad for next month's tour of West Indies will be announced on July 19. Captain Virat Kohli and pacer Jasprit Bumrah are expected to be rested for limited-overs leg comprising three T20Is and three ODIs, as per reports. Talking about MS Dhoni's future, a BCCI official said, "Only he can decide whether he wants to carry on or not."
https://www.financialexpress.com/sports/india-squad-for-west-indies-tour-to-be-announced-on-july-19-no-clarity-on-dhonis-future-yet/1644703/?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts
The Financial Express
The Indian team for next month’s tour of West Indies will be announced on July 19 but there is no clarity over the future of Mahendra Singh Dhoni ahead of the limited-overs leg beginning August 3.
Dhoni’s future has been widely speculated ever since India lost to New Zealand in the World Cup semifinal on July 9. The 38-year-old is expected to make an announcement on it in the coming few days.
“The selectors will meet in Mumbai on July 19. We have not heard from Dhoni but what is relevant is the communication between the player and selectors. If you ask me, Dhoni did well in the Word Cup but he is his own man. Only he can decide whether he wants to carry on or not,” a BCCI official told PTI after the Committee Of Administrators’ meeting here.
Skipper Virat Kohli and pace spearhead Jasprit Bumrah are expected to be rested for the limited-overs leg comprising three T20s and as many ODIs before returning for the two-Test series starting August 22. The five-day matches will be part of the inaugural World Test Championship.
There is also no official word on the availability of opener Shikhar Dhawan who is recovering from a thumb injury that cut short his World Cup campaign.
It was COA’s first meeting since India’s heartbreaking loss at Manchester but the Vinod Rai-led committee did not discuss the team’s performance.
However, the three-member panel and CEO Rahul Johri, who joined in via video conferencing as he remains in London for the ICC meetings, did discuss the issue of players picking and choosing games.
Former greats like Sunil Gavaskar had questioned the BCCI for allowing the likes of Dhoni and Shikhar Dhawan to skip domestic cricket in the run-up to the World Cup.
“The question arises that who is allowing the players to pick and choose? Are they taking the call themselves or are they duly informing the selectors? The general feeling is that there needs to better communication on this issue,” said another BCCI official.
“You can’t pick and choose. Most World Cup-bound players played all games of the IPL and did not ask for rest back then,” he added.

The minor, identified as Nageena, slipped into the fast-moving stream at Tangmarg and was washed away by the strong currents.
Learning about the situation, a group of six CRPF personnel, who were nearby, rushed to save the girl. While two constables waded through the stream to catch hold of the girl, the others ran downstream as a second line of defence in case the first two jawans could not rescue her.
Both the constables, MG Naidu and Nalla Upendra of 176 Battalion, were later awarded DG's Commendation Disc and Commendation Certificate by the DG CRPF for their brave act.
Their brave act also received a lot of praise on social media.

The New Indian Express
BHOPAL: A deputy inspector general (DIG) of Railway Protection Force (RPF) was booked for alleged sexual harassment of a railway official’s wife on board the Indore-Jabalpur Overnight Express train in Madhya Pradesh during the wee hours on Monday.
The senior RPF officer identified as Vijay Khatarkar was travelling in the AC-II class coach of the overnight train to Jabalpur. The railway official’s wife too was travelling to Jabalpur with her six-year-old daughter on the adjoining berth.
Both, the DIG-RPF and the woman’s husband are posted in Jabalpur only.
The alleged incident happened at around 4 am between Narsinghpur and Jabalpur. The railway official’s wife started crying for help alleging misconduct by the co-passenger. Hearing her cry for help, other co-passengers rushed to the woman’s seat, after which the on-duty travel ticket examiner (TTE) was informed about the development.
When the train reached Jabalpur in the morning, the Government Railway Police (GRP) lodged a complaint against the senior RPF officer under Section 354A of IPC. The investigations in the case will be done by a female sub-inspector under the supervision of ASP-GRP. “The woman’s statements will also be recorded before the magistrate possibly on Tuesday. No arrest has been made in the case as investigations are underway,” SP-GRP Jabalpur SK Jain told The New Indian Express.
Meanwhile, the DIG-RPF Vijay Khatarkar flatly denied the female co-passenger’s allegations, saying he was only picking up the water bottle, but accidentally touched her hand. The senior RPF officer also told journalists that he even apologized to the woman, but she refused to listen to him.

All who watched at home will try to be the next Stokes: Morgan
Praising Ben Stokes, England captain Eoin Morgan said, "[E]verybody watching at home will hopefully try and be the next Ben Stokes." Morgan further said, "It is almost superhuman. He has really carried the team and our batting line-up." Stokes ended the 2019 edition of the World Cup with a total of 465 runs and seven wickets.

Times Now
London: Being Ben Stokes is not easy but all those who watched his fight to bring the 'Cup' home on Sunday should try to emulate him, skipper Eoin Morgan said after a historic final. From hitting nadir to reaching zenith, no cricketer in recent times would have gone through an entire gamut of emotions like Stokes.
"The atmosphere, the emotion that was going through the whole game, he managed to deal with that in an extremely experienced manner. And obviously, everybody watching at home will hopefully try and be the next Ben Stokes," Morgan couldn't have paid a bigger compliment to the Man of the Final.
He was on his hunches when Carlos Brathwaite hit him for those sixes under a smoky Calcutta skyline during a World T20 final three summers back. His career could have ended that day and Morgan couldn't agree more.
"Yes and I have said that a number of times about Ben. I think a lot of careers would have been ended after what happened in Calcutta," Morgan reiterated. Funnily ironical but all of England's premier all-rounders over the years have had colourful lives bordering on controversy.
Whether it is Ian Botham smoking cannabis or an inebriated Andrew Flintoff hitting the sea and trying to paddle a boat, they have never been the establishment's favourite child.
Stokes is no exception as he was found doing a Rocky Balboa in front of a Bristol pub a couple of years ago. He floored a few with perfect right hooks and then stood in the court room in front of the judge. Another premature ending loomed but the 'Big Ben' is destiny's child. And then Lord's happened -- a World Cup final and he did everything.
"To come through it is extraordinary. He's (Stokes) is almost superhuman. He has really carried the team and our batting line-up," Morgan was beaming for once while showing a dour face during other times.
"I know Jos and his partnership was extraordinary, but to bat with the lower order the way he did I thought was incredible," he showered praise. Tired, sweaty and exhausted after a tie, he came out again, ran a three, hit a six, got a score for Super Over.
And just when one thought he has done everything, he reminded young Jofra Archer: "One over won't define who you are". That was enough to bowl one good ball that ensured a World Cup win. From Sunday, the legend of Stokes will only grow.
And Morgan attributed it to the all-rounder's qualities as a team-man. "Ben, on numerous occasions, has stood up individually and in a unit for us. He leads the way in training, in any team meetings we have, and he's an incredible cricketer. "And today he's had a huge day out and obviously we are thankful for that," said 'Captain' Morgan, ready to raise a toast for his asset.

IndiGo secures ₹2,577 cr of credit facility in June quarter
IndiGo-operator InterGlobe Aviation availed credit facility of around ₹2,577.75 crore in the first quarter for meeting its working capital requirements, filings showed. This is thrice the amount availed by it in the year-ago period. It secured ₹1,050 crore from Standard Chartered Bank in April, ₹660.32 crore from Crédit Agricole CIB in May, and ₹867.43 crore from Deutsche Bank in June.

MUMBAI: Interglobe Aviation Ltd. which operates the country’s largest airline under the brand IndiGo has secured a credit facility of around  ₹2,577.75 crore since April for meeting its working capital needs, while targeting an expansion of the carrier’s fleet.
On 17 June, IndiGo signed a $20 billion agreement with aircraft engine maker CFM International to buy CFM International LEAP-1A engines to power 280 Airbus A320neo and A321neo aircraft. The deal includes supply of spare engines and an engine overhaul support agreement.
According to filings with the ministry of corporate affairs, on 6 May, the airline secured an amount of  ₹660.32 crore from Credit Agricole CIB by creating an exclusive charge over a part of IndiGo’s fixed deposits. 
The credit facility of  ₹2,577 crore availed by IndiGo during the April-June period is more than three times as compared to the corresponding quarter of last year. Last year, the airline secured credit facilities worth about  ₹778.06 crore, which included a facility of  ₹78.06 crore from Kotak Mahindra Bank and  ₹700 crore from HSBC through a pledge of mutual fund investments and lien on fixed deposits owned by IndiGo.
Again, on 3 June, IndiGo secured a credit facility of  ₹867.43 crore from Deutsche Bank AG by pledging the airline’s investments in three mutual fund schemes managed by Aditya Birla Sun Life Mutual Fund, ICICI Prudential Asset Management and SBI Mutual Fund.
The airline previously had a credit facility of  ₹458.35 crore from Deutsche Bank through a pledge of IndiGo’s mutual fund investments.
Earlier, on 4 April, IndiGo secured a credit facility of  ₹1,050 crore from Standard Chartered Bank by enabling a first and exclusive charge over IndiGo’s mutual fund investments and by creation of a lien over IndiGo’s fixed deposits worth  ₹185 crore, including the interest over such deposit in favour of the bank and any renewals or rollovers of further deposits with the bank.
Interglobe Aviation is currently undergoing a scrutiny by the Securities and Exchange Board of India over allegations of corporate governance lapses with regards to related party transactions with its co-promoter Rahul Bhatia-led IGE Group. Also, IGE Group and IndiGo’s other co-promoter Rakesh Gangwal are entangled in a public dispute as the Gangwal-led RG Group feels that powers to manage businesses and appoint directors on the board of IndiGo are disproportionately in favour of the IGE Group.

JSW Steel tells NCLT it's 'anxious' about BPSL fraud reports
JSW Steel on Monday informed the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) that it was "anxious" about the reports of alleged fraud at bankrupt Bhushan Power & Steel (BPSL). However, it added it wasn't backing out of BPSL's ongoing insolvency resolution process. Allahabad Bank and Punjab National Bank recently reported alleged frauds of ₹1,775 crore and ₹3,805 crore respectively by BPSL.

New Delhi: JSW Steel on Monday told the National Company Law Tribunal that the company is not backing out from the ongoing resolution process of Bhushan Power & Steel despite reports of alleged fraud by its former promoters.
During the proceedings in NCLT, counsel appearing for JSW Steel informed the tribunal that it was anxious about the alleged fraud reports and needs to know what is going inside Bhushan Power & Steel Ltd (BPSL).
A two member NCLT bench headed by the President Justice M M Kumar asked the Resolution Professional (RP) of BPSL to hand over a copy of the forensic report to JSW Steel.
NCLT said that alleged fraud reports will not have any impact on the insolvency resolution process and JSW's resolution plan for BPSL.
NCLT has to take a decision over the lenders' approval of the resolution plan of JSW Steel for BPSL.
Earlier on February 4, the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) had dismissed the plea of Tata Steel and upheld the Committee of Creditors (CoC) decision to approve JSW Steel's bid.
The NCLAT had said the CoC decision was well within its rights to negotiate better terms with resolution applicants and has had asked NCLT to decide over JSW Steel's bid by March 31, 2019.
However, the judgement is still pending before the Principal bench of NCLT.
JSW Steel had revised its offer from  ₹11,000 crore to  ₹18,000 crore and later to over  ₹19,000 crore, whereas Tata Steel's last offer was at  ₹17,000 crore after it had refused to revise its bid.
Last week, state-owned lender Allahabad Bank had reported fraud of over  ₹1,774 crore by BPSL to the Reserve Bank of India.
Earlier, PNB reported a fraud worth  ₹3,805.15 crore by BPSL by misappropriating bank funds and manipulating its books of accounts.
Around 85 per cent of PNB's  ₹4,399 crore exposure to the company had been siphoned off.
Investigate agency CBI has already registered complaint in April names several other lenders.
According to the CBI, BPSL diverted around  ₹2,348 crore through its directors and staff from the loan accounts of PNB, Oriental Bank of Commerce, IDBI Bank and UCO Bank into the accounts of more than 200 shell companies without any obvious purpose.

Plea in Delhi HC seeks linking of Aadhaar with property documents
A petition seeking a direction to the Centre and Delhi government for linking of people's movable and immovable property documents with their Aadhaar numbers was filed in Delhi High Court on Monday by BJP leader Ashwini Upadhyay.

NEW DELHI: A petition was moved in the Delhi High Court on Monday seeking a direction to the Centre and Delhi government to link movable and immovable property documents of citizens with their Aadhaar number to curb corruption, black money generation and benami transaction.
The petition in this regard was filed by advocate and BJP leader Ashwini Upadhyay, who submitted that it is the duty of the government to take apposite steps to curb corruption and seize the benami properties made by illegal means.
"Executive action should be taken to warn the corrupt that betrayal of the public trust will no longer be tolerated and to reaffirm the rule of law and transparency," the plea submitted.
The petitioner said that the main advantage of the strategy would be that the tax authorities will get the details of "legal owners" immediately and once the Aadhaar linkage takes place, tax authorities can approach them.
"It will clean our electoral process, which is dominated by black-money and benami transaction and thrives on a cycle of large black investments, the capture of power through foul means and use of political strength to amass private wealth, all with disdain of the citizen," the petition stated.
The petition is likely to come for hearing on Tuesday.

Times Now
New Delhi: The Union Public Service Commission(UPSC) 2014 topper, Ira Singhal has become a victim of trolling on social media. On Sunday, she narrated her ordeal on social media platform-Facebook, where she claimed that she was subjected to verbal abuse. 
In her Facebook post, Ira mentioned, "For anyone who thinks people with disabilities don't have to face anything, as the world is nice and kind - just sharing someone's comments from my Instagram account." She added the screenshots from her Instagram wall, where a man named Bhupesh Jaswal commented, 'Kubdi' on her pose and later in the comments section he abused her.  
Ira in her post further mentioned him as, "A face of cyber-bullying. Unfortunately, someone who cannot be bullied is being attempted to be bullied. And this is probably a person who wants to be a Civil Servant. This is why we need Inclusive Schools and this is why we need our education system to focus on producing better human beings more than anything else."
 
 
In 2014 civil services examination, Ira had topped examination and became the first candidate to top the general category despite being differently-abled. She had also appeared in the examination in 2010 securing the 815th rank. But, reportedly she was not given a posting due to her disability. However, she denied to give up and later in 2014, stood first and got a posting in Hyderabad.
Further in her Facebook post, she emphasised that giving punishment to such people (cyber bullies) doesn't change their mentality and he will not suddenly become a great person. "All that will happen is that our anger gets satisfied. What really needs to be done, is to help people change their mentality and attitude towards disabilities and abilities," she added. 
In the end, she condemned the act and said, "Oh yes, attempting Cyber-bullying is bad and must not be tolerated. Unfortunately, he picked someone who cannot be bullied."

Bigg Boss Telugu organiser asked how I could live without sex: Actress
Actress Gayathri Gupta has filed a complaint against Bigg Boss Telugu organisers alleging that they cheated her and hurt her self-respect by asking inappropriate questions. She claimed that during her meeting with the show's coordinator from Mumbai, he asked her how she could live for 100 days without sex. Gayathri further alleged her contract for the show was abruptly terminated.

The News Minute
A few days after journalist Swetha Reddy filed a complaint against the Bigg Boss Telugu organisers alleging  sexual harassment, actor Gayathri Gupta too has filed a complaint against STAR MAA- Bigg Boss coordinators. The actor has filed a police complaint alleging that she was cheated and one of the organisers hurt her by asking inappropriate personal questions.
In her complaint submitted to the Banjara Hills police on July 14, Gayathri says she had received a call from Raghu, one of STAR MAA’s coordinators, with a proposal to participate in the season three of Bigg Boss show. Gayathri agreed to the proposal and met Ravikanth, Raghu and another HR person from the channel a couple of times at various locations in Hyderabad until June.
Speaking to TNM, Gayathri says that during her final conversation with the show's team, Abhishek, the show’s coordinator from Mumbai, had also come down and met her at her house in Manikonda.
“We decided on the payment and I also signed the agreement papers which clearly stated that I couldn’t take up any other project until the completion of the 100 days inside the Bigg Boss house. Keeping the same in mind, they blocked my dates and I rejected a couple of film offers that had come my way,” Gayathri adds.
“Abhishek then went on to ask me if I was ready to stay away from my phone and asked how I could live for 100 days without sex. I didn’t understand why he had to ask me such a personal and inappropriate question. Abhishek then asked me what I could do in order to impress the “boss”,” the actor alleges.
Gayathri says Abhishek didn’t mention who the boss was and according to the FIR filed, on June 25 she received a call from Ravikanth stating that she was no longer a part of the Bigg Boss show.
“I had earlier mentioned about my health issue and they had assured that it could be managed, even while signing the agreement papers. When asked why I was terminated, Ravikanth told it was because of my health issue. If it was really an issue, why did they even make me sign the papers and block my dates?” Gaythri asks.
An FIR has been registered against Ravikanth and Abhishek under Section 354A (iv) of IPC (making sexually coloured remarks, shall be guilty of the offence of sexual harassment).
Gayathri was a presenter with the Telugu channel Sakshi and later started acting in movies. She rose to fame after her roles in Ice-cream 2 and her role as Sai Pallavi's friend in Fidaa.
A similar case was filed against the coordinators of STAR MAA, including Ravikanth and Abhishek a few days ago, based on a complaint filed by journalist Swetha Reddy alleging sexual harassment. Swetha had alleged that the Bigg Boss team had fat-shamed her and asked her what she could in order to satisfy the “boss”.
“They have cheated and harassed me and I believe that it’s important I come out in the open and bring the issue to the notice of people. I would never want to go back to the show and in fact such reality shows on television should be banned,” Swetha had told TNM.

Allah was also with us: Eoin Morgan on 'luck' in World Cup final
On being asked whether "the luck of an Irishman" got England over the line in World Cup final, Dublin-born England captain Eoin Morgan said, "We had Allah with us as well." "I spoke to Adil Rashid. He said...'Allah is definitely with us'. It's the rub of the green. It actually epitomises our team. Quite diverse backgrounds and cultures," he added.

Hosts England and 2015 finalists New Zealand featured in the most thrilling World Cup final in the tournament’s 44-year history at the iconic Lord’s on Sunday. The match ended in a tie after 100 overs as both teams scored 241 runs and even the Super Over succeeding it concluded as a tie with both sides making 15 runs. However, it was Eoin Morgan who lifted the trophy as his team had hit more number of boundaries.
Not many were convinced with such a conclusion in the tournament but yet the rules were rules. Even before the match ended the way it did, there was a moment of utter confusion and tension and it had gone to England’s favour as well. It was the fourth ball of the 50th over which was being bowled by Trent Boult. England needed 15 runs off the final over and with only six runs taken off the first three, the Three Lions were left to score nine off the last three.

Ben Stokes was on strike while Adil Rashid was at the other end. Stokes hit the ball on the on-side and ran for two. Martin Guptill was the fielder and as he threw the ball in, it hit Stokes who gave a dive to complete the second run. The deflected ball went for four overthrow runs and the umpire awarded England six runs for that. They needed to score just three off the last two from therefrom.
The decision was debated as experts felt England should have been given five runs and not six since the two batsmen had not started for their second run when the ball was released by the fielder. In complete chaos, New Zealand felt things were “uncontrollable” while England were not complaining.
The home team skipper, Eoin Morgan, was asked at the post-match conference whether the “luck of an Irishman” got England over the line. The captain smiled and said: “We had Allah with us as well”.
“I spoke to Adil (Rashid). He said Allah is definitely with us. It’s the rub of the green. It’s also reflective of our team; we’re a diverse side and we brought that together today,” Morgan, who is the first captain to lead England in two World Cups, said.

The England side that competed in the 2019 World Cup is a multicultural one. While Morgan himself is an Irish by birth, Stokes was born in New Zealand. Jofra Archer is a West Indian by birth while Tom Curran was born in South Africa.

I'm probably most hated father in NZ: Stokes' father after WC final
England all-rounder Ben Stokes father Ged, who stays in New Zealand, joked that he's the most hated father in New Zealand after his son's performance in 2019 World Cup final. "I really am disappointed for the Black Caps...Hand on heart, I am overjoyed for Ben and the team, but I am still a New Zealand supporter," Ged added.

Gerard Stokes, England all-rounder Ben Stokes’ father, reckons himself to be the ‘most hated’ father in New Zealand. Stokes scored a masterful 84* off 98 balls in England’s run-chase of 242 in the World Cup final and then weaved his magic in the Super Over where his team edged New Zealand. The Three Lions got their hands on the coveted trophy for the final time ever having qualified for their only second semi-final since the 1992 appearance.
Stokes was rightly presented the Player of the Match. As far as his father is concerned, Gerard and his wife Deb are based in Christchurch, New Zealand. But the family moved to England after Gerard took a rugby league coaching contract in Cumbria where 12-year-old Ben began his cricketing endeavour.

Gerard funnily revealed how he heard a few of the fans, considering hatred for him after Stokes’ brilliance at the Home of Cricket. “I’ve had one or two say I’m probably the most hated father in New Zealand. That was pretty tongue-in-cheek, I hope it was anyway,” Gerard was quoted as saying in 1 News.
After Eoin Morgan & Co emerged victoriously, Gerard had rather mixed feelings. While he was over the moon for his son, he said that he’s a Black Caps’ supporters. Speaking on Ben, his dad mentioned that the hard work his loved one has put in has paid rich dividends.
“I really am disappointed for the Black Caps; it’s such a shame someone had to walk away without the trophy. Hand on heart, I am overjoyed for Ben and the team, but I am still a New Zealand supporter. I don’t think they would have been able to hold him back. He’s was obviously fatigued but he’s pretty fit at the moment and all the hard work has paid off,” he added.
Ben Stokes’ career has seen a lot of ups and down. From not being able to deliver in crunch moments to getting involved in non-cricketing brawls, he needed to find the right path to success. The World Cup presented him with a perfect platform to show his potential and Stokes grabbed the chance with both hands. The tears of happiness he shed after the triumph narrated an entire story.

Saravana owner suffers heart attack, extremely critical: Doctors
Saravana Bhavan restaurant chain Founder and murder case convict P Rajagopal suffered from a heart attack on Saturday and remains extremely critical, doctors have said. Rajagopal, who is currently on ventilator support, surrendered in Chennai on July 9 to serve a life term. He had arrived in an ambulance with an oxygen mask strapped to his face to surrender himself.

The News Minute
Saravana Bhavan hotels founder and murder case convict P Rajagopal's suffered from a heart attack late on Saturday, remains critical and is on ventilator support at present. 
P Rajagopal, who surrendered before the IV Magistrate court in Chennai on July 8, was admitted to Stanley Medical College hospital on the same day. Plagued by health issues, Rajagopal had, in fact, arrived at the court complex in an ambulance from Vijaya Hospital and was taken in a stretcher to the court. He then surrendered in the murder case as per the orders of the Supreme Court.
Speaking to TNM about Rajagopal's health condition, his advocate Muthukannaiyan said that Rajagopal already had a lot of health issues. "He is diabetic and already has a lot of problems. He can't really walk and his vision is not okay. His kidneys were also weak. We had admitted him in Vijaya hospital for this reason," he said.
The advocate added that doctors in Stanley hospital had recommended that Rajagopal be admitted to the hospital till he recovered, when he was taken there for a medical checkup before being taken to the prison. "While at Stanley, he got a heart attack on Saturday night and is in recovery since then. As of Sunday night, he was in critical condition and doctors are continuously watching him."
Confirming that Rajagopal indeed is in a critical condition in Stanley hospital, Dr P Ramesh, the Resident Medical Officer told TNM that he was a diabetic and a hypertension patient. "He is in an extremely critical condition. His kidneys are also failing and he is in the ICU and on the ventilator," he said.
Rajagopal was convicted to ten years rigorous imprisonment by a sessions court for the abduction and murder of a man named Prince Santhakumar in 2001. Rajagopal allegedly wanted to marry Jeevajyothi, Santhakumar's wife, based on the advice of an astrologer. Despite Jeevajyothi's resistance, Rajagopal continued to pursue and harass her and her husband.   
Rajagopal had appealed against the decision of the sessions court in the Madras High court, which revised the sentence to life imprisonment. He challenged the sentence in Supreme Court, and after much delay, the Supreme Court upheld the life imprisonment. The court also gave Rajagopal time till July 7 to surrender owing to health issues. Rajagopal, however, failed to surrender on the said date and filed a plea with the apex court on the next day seeking extension for his surrender. The Supreme Court had refused to grant him relief and ordered him to surrender immediately.
Meanwhile, Rajagopal's son has moved  a habeas corpus petition before the Madras High Court pleading that his father be shifted to a private hospital for treatment. His lawyer made a special mention before a division bench of Justices MM Sundresh and M Nirmal Kumar. The TN government, represented by the additional public prosecutor, informed the court that he would get instructions from the government by Tuesday.

1 arrested for violence against doctors at Mumbai hospital
A man was arrested on Monday by Mumbai Police in relation to the attack on three doctors of Nair Hospital. Three people were named in the FIR, out of which two were women. Family members of the patient allegedly attacked the doctors on Sunday after he died during treatment. Police said efforts were underway to arrest the other accused.

Times Now
Mumbai: A man has been arrested by the Mumbai Police in relation to the attack on three doctors of the Nair Hospital. Three people have been named in the FIR of the incident, out of which, two are women. Family members of a patient allegedly attacked the doctors on Saturday after the patient died during treatment. 
The patient's kin attacked three resident doctors and vandalised hospital property. The police said that efforts are underway to arrest the other two accused. 
The 46-year-old patient had been undergoing treatment for Tuberculosis and HIV. The doctors who had been attacked claimed that they had informed the patients' family that he was extremely critical when he was brought to the hospital. 
The deceased had been admitted in ward number 23 of the hospital. When the patient's kin learned about his death, the relatives allegedly entered into the ward and started abusing the doctors. The accused then started assaulting the doctors and security guards. 
Maharashtra Association of Resident Doctors (MARD) voiced their support towards the doctors and condemned the incident. MARD said that increased violence towards doctors has caused mental stress to the medical fraternity. 
Following the attack, MARD demanded the formulation of the Central Protection Act for medicos all across the country. The organisation said that necessary amendments should be made in the Doctors Protection Act. They said that security audits should be conducted in government-run hospitals and an emergency alarm system should also be installed to strengthen security. 
TIn a similar case reported from Jharkhand's Ranchi, the relatives of a patient attacked doctors of the Ranchi Trust Hospital in June. The accused attacked medical superintendent Dr AK Singh, Dr Om Prakash Mahansarai, Dr SK Sinha and Dr Nijam. 
The patient had been brought to the hospital after he had been involved in a drowning accident in Patratu Dam. The doctors declared the patient dead on arrival after which, his relatives started shouting slogans outside the hospital. The mob allegedly attacked Dr Singh when he went to pacify them. The mob also allegedly attacked the doctors who tried to rescue Dr Singh. A group of junior resident doctors filed a plea after the incident and demanded protection for medical professionals. 
In June this year, a nation-wide strike by doctors was carried out in support of a junior doctor who had been seriously wounded in an attack by the relatives of a deceased patient at the NRS Medical College. The junior doctor had been attacked after the 75-year-old patient succumbed to his ailment. Doctors from all across the country carried out 'cease-work' strikes to show their solidarity towards the junior doctor.

Mathematician who cracked Nazi code for WWII win to be on £50 note
English mathematician Alan Turing, who helped Britain win the Second World War by cracking Nazi code, will appear on Bank of England's new £50 polymer note by the end of 2021. The note features a ticker tape of binary code that depicts his birthday (June 23, 1912). He committed suicide in 1954 after he was chemically castrated for being homosexual.

The Wire
Manchester: Mathematician Alan Turing, who helped Britain win the Second World War with his code-cracking died by suicide after being convicted for homosexuality, will appear on the Bank of England‘s next 50-pound banknote, the BoE said on Monday.
“As the father of computer science and artificial intelligence, as well as war hero, Alan Turing‘s contributions were far-ranging and path-breaking,” BoE governor Mark Carney said. “Turing is a giant on whose shoulders so many now stand.”
Turing‘s electro-mechanical machine, a forerunner of modern computers, unraveled the “unbreakable” Enigma code used by Nazi Germany. His work at Bletchley Park, Britain’s wartime code-breaking centre, was credited with shortening the war and saving thousands of lives.
But he was stripped of his job and chemically castrated with injections of female hormones after being convicted of gross indecency in 1952 for having sex with a man. Homosexual sex was illegal in Britain until 1967.
Turing killed himself in 1954, aged 41, with cyanide. He was granted a rare royal pardon by Queen Elizabeth in 2013 for the criminal conviction that led to his suicide.
As well as an image of Turing, the new note will feature a table and mathematical formulae from a 1936 paper by Turing on computable numbers, an image of a pilot computer and technical drawings for the machines used to break the Enigma code.
The note will also include a quote by Turing about the rise of machine intelligence: “This is only a foretaste of what is to come, and only the shadow of what is going to be.”
Turing was selected by the BoE from a shortlist of contenders from the fields of science and mathematics, including the late cosmologist Stephen Hawking.
The existing 50-pound banknote features engineer James Watt and his business partner Matthew Boulton, who developed and marketed the steam engine in the late 18th century.
The 50-pound note is the BoE’s highest-value banknote and is rarely used in daily transactions. The new note is expected to enter circulation by the end of 2021, the BoE said.

It was a day when sport won: Sania on World Cup, Wimbledon finals
Reacting to 2019 World Cup and Wimbledon men's singles final which took place on Sunday, Sania Mirza tweeted, "What a day...It was a day when sport won." England defeated New Zealand on boundaries after the match and Super Over both ended in a tie. Meanwhile, Djokovic defeated Federer in four hours and 57 minutes to win his fifth Wimbledon title.
https://www.crictracker.com/sania-mirza-pleasantly-relieved-after-the-last-gasp-world-cup-2019-and-wimbledon-spectacles/?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts
CricTracker
On July 14, Super Sunday, the sporting world was a witness to a couple of nail-biting matches. The final of the 2019 World Cup and the final of the Wimbledon enthralled one and all in the sports fraternity. As far as the cricketing aspect is concerned, New Zealand and England strained every sinew to get their hands on the silverware. The game wasn’t a high-scoring one, but it entertained through.
After the Black Cups set 242 as the target, the Brits didn’t have it easy by any stretch of the imagination. But Jos Buttler and Ben Stokes pulled them out of the pits and reignited the hopes of the Three Lions’ maiden World Cup. The Englishmen scored 15 off the last over from Trent Boult courtesy of some unreal composure from Stokes, who churned out a priceless knock of 84 runs of 98 balls.

The game was tied and it went into the Super Over, where England scored 15 runs off Boult. New Zealand tied their opponent even in the one-over eliminator, but couldn’t get their hands on the silverware. England won on account of having smacked more number of boundaries.
Meanwhile, at the Wimbledon Centre Court, the evergreen Roger Federer and Novak Djokovic fought it out for glory. Djokovic edged the legend through a tiebreaker in the first set but got thrashed in the second. However, in the third set, the Serbian kept his nerves tight to edge out Federer in another tie-breaker. Federer isn’t someone to throw in the towel easily and got his mojo back as he got back to contention as he made it two sets all after four sets.
The fifth set turned out to be an absolute delight. Both pulled off some stupendous shots to hold the fort. After 24 games, the match went into a tiebreaker. After losing the first two tiebreakers, Federer had the chance to make amends, but unfortunately, the Swiss personality couldn’t.
Djokovic won the game 7-6 (7/6), 1-6, 7-6 (7/4), 4-6, 13-12 (7/3) in a five-hour long Wimbledon summit clash. In the meantime, Sania Mirza, who is involved in both the sports, directly and indirectly, was sandwiched between the two intriguing finals. Sania is an Indian tennis star and her husband Shoaib Malik was recently retired from the Pakistan cricket team. The 32-year-old India tennis star was delighted by the quality of both the sports. She also congratulated the athletes for putting their best foot forward.
The Indian star took to Twitter and wrote, “Now that I have recovered finally after these two unbelievable matches @Wimbledon and @cricketworldcup @icc.. What a day.. It was a day when Sport won hats off to these athletes ..”

Not worried about outrage over same-sex relationship: Dutee
Indian sprinter Dutee Chand has revealed that the outrage over her relationship with a girl does not bother her anymore. Chand has returned after winning a gold medal in the 100m event in the World University Games at Napoli. "I got so many encouragements from eminent personalities which boost up my self-confidence to achieve this prestigious recognition," Chand added.

India.com
Indian sprinter Dutee Chand said the heat she received after announcing her relationship with a girl does not bother her anymore, after returning from Italy. She won a gold medal in the 100m event there in the World University Games at Napoli.
The athlete was subjected to a series of hateful comments and depreciation after she opened up about her same-sex relationship. Even her family members, including her mother and sister, did not stand by her and publicly condemned her action. But on returning to India, she said she is not worried about them and that her personal issues do not impact her professional life.
She further said that her next aim is now to repeat a similar kind of performance and win gold in the next World Championship. She would be on a foreign land practising particularly for the global event set to be held from September 28 to October 6, 2019, in Doha, Qatar.
Dutee further emphasized on the importance of sports for the young generation of the country. She said that children should concentrate on games and other activities with seriousness beside their studies.
She also talked about how support at a very young age is important for anyone to evolve as a sportsperson. “I got so many encouragements from eminent personalities which boost up my self-confidence to achieve this prestigious recognition,” she said.
Dutee Chand won gold in the 100-metre event at Napoli after finishing the race in just 11.32 seconds. However, her record in 100m is 11.24 seconds. Earlier, she had clinched a gold in the same event at the 2018 Asian Games in Jakarta, becoming the first ever Indian to get the top spot in podium there since 1998. She also became the third Indian women sprinter to have ever participated in the Olympics during the 2016 edition in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.

Act against forceful chanting of religious slogans: Mayawati
BSP supremo Mayawati on Monday called the "new wrong practice" of forcefully making people chant religious slogans in states including Uttar Pradesh a "violent trend" and asked central and state governments to take strong action against it. This comes after 12 youths were booked for allegedly pulling an imam's beard and forcing him to chant 'Jai Shri Ram' in Muzaffarnagar.
https://www.financialexpress.com/india-news/mayawati-seeks-action-against-those-forcing-people-to-chant-religious-slogans/1644651/?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts
The Financial Express
BSP chief Mayawati on Monday alleged that a “wrong practice” of forcing people to chant religious slogans has begun in Uttar Pradesh and a few other states, while seeking tough action against it from the Centre and state governments. Mayawati’s remarks came after a cleric claimed that he was forced to chant ‘Jai Shri Ram’.
“In some states, including Uttar Pradesh, a wrong practice of forcing people to chant religious slogans and committing atrocities has begun, and it should be condemned,” she tweeted.
In her post on the micro-blogging site in Hindi, she also said, “There is a need for the Centre and state governments to take tough actions against it so that brotherhood and harmony is maintained everywhere and development is not affected.”
Citing a complaint lodged by the cleric, SP Shailesh Kumar Pandey said Imam Imlaq-ur-Rehman, a Muzaffarnagar resident, was going to his village on his motorcycle on Saturday, when nearly 12 youngsters accosted him, beat him up and also pulled his beard. The UP Police has booked nearly 12 youths in the matter, the SP added.

Mark Cuban, Serena Williams invest $3 mn in startup for new moms
Investor Mark Cuban and tennis star Serena Williams have invested $3 million in Mahmee, a US-based startup that delivers data-driven care coordination and personalised support to new mothers. It provides online group discussions with other moms, connection to medical service providers and support from trained maternity coaches. It was founded in 2014 by Melissa Hanna, Linda Hanna and Sunny Walia.
https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/15/serena-williams-mark-cuban-invest-3-million-in-mahmee-a-digital-support-network-for-new-moms/?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts
TechCrunch
Tennis superstar and mom to a 22-month-old, Serena Williams has joined Mark Cuban  to invest $3 million seed funding in Mahmee, a startup working toward filling the critical care gap in postpartum care.
For those who’ve never given birth or who (count your blessings!) never had any mishaps in the hospital or afterwards, the weeks and months following childbirth can be extremely hard on the new mom, with estimates as high as one in five women suffering from postpartum depression or anxiety and about 9% of women experiencing post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) following childbirth — and those are just the mood and mental health disorders.
Physical recovery, even for those with a healthy, run-of-the-mill birth, takes at least six weeks — eight weeks if you’ve had a C-section. And then there are all the medical complications. Williams, who has a history of blood clots, ended up basically shouting at the doctors to give her a CT scan that saved her life.
The real issue, at the heart of all this, according to Mahmee  co-founder Melissa Hanna, is that “the data is fragmented.” She says this is why she built a network to get new moms the support they need — from their community, other moms and medical providers.
Mahmee provides not only online group discussions with other moms going through the same thing and at the same stage but also connection to your medical provider. On top of that, it adds support from a trained “maternity coach” who can flag if something is wrong.
One example Hanna used was a new mom who was exhibiting symptoms of septic shock. The co-founder says a coach was able to call this mom on the spot and get her to contact her OB-GYN right away.
There are other online services like Postpartum Support International (PSI) and the Bloom Foundation, which both provide a sort of digital network and resources for new moms, but Hanna believes it is that missing link to medical professionals after mom has gone home from the hospital that really makes a difference.
“We’re so focused on delivering a healthy baby that mom gets side-lined,” she told TechCrunch. Adding in a statement, “And this industry is lacking the IT infrastructure needed to connect these professionals from different organizations to each other, and to follow and monitor patients across practices and health systems. This missing element creates gaps in care. Mahmee is the glue that connects the care ecosystem and closes the gaps.”
While other sites mentioned above are free to use, Mahmee, which goes beyond social support to providing engagement and patient monitoring, makes money through group and individual video calls (the introductory session with a coach is free) and various support groups. There are also different payment tiers starting at $20 a month and up toward $200 per month where new parents can ask unlimited questions through a HIPAA-secure, online dashboard connecting them with their medical providers and Mahmee coaches.
Do new moms need to pay someone to help them out and monitor them medically after they get home from the hospital? Possibly. Some local hospitals and medical networks also provide various types of help — both through counseling and new parent support groups. But often it can take weeks to get a counseling session at a busy hospital and your OB may have too many patients to call and check up on you. Having this type of support could just save your life — and, if anything else, checking in with a group of moms going through the same thing could be the key to saving your sanity.
Hanna admits it’s early days for her startup, but tells TechCrunch there are more than 1,000 providers in the Mahmee network so far. She plans to use the $3 million to grow her team, including engineers, clinicians and sales staff, and hints she’s working on several partnerships within the healthcare industry right now.

C'garh govt criticised over proposal to add egg in mid-day meals
The Chhattisgarh government's proposal to add egg in the Mid-day Meal Scheme to fight malnutrition in students was criticised by social organisations and the BJP opposition. "This is a move to promote non-vegetarian food. There are other vegetarian options to fight...malnourishment," said an opposer. The government had reached out to the group through a committee, however, no solution was found.
https://www.freepressjournal.in/india/chhattisgarh-govt-faces-backlash-over-proposing-to-include-egg-in-midday-meals?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts
Free Press Journal
Raipur: The Chhattisgarh government's proposal of including egg in the Midday Meal Scheme to fight malnourishment among children is facing a backlash from several social organisations and the opposition BJP. Among the most vocal opponents of the move are the followers of Kabir Panth in the state. After they protested against the plan, the government reached out to the group through a committee of ministers. However, no solution was found.
Daya Shankar of Kabir Ashram in Damakhed told ANI, "This is a move to promote non-vegetarian food. There are other vegetarian options to fight the problem of malnourishment. In schools, which are the temples of education, no non-vegetarian food should be allowed and we will campaign against it." Following the opposition, a four-member committee comprising state Home Minister Tamradhwaj Sahu, Education Minister Premsai Singh Tekam, Child and Woman Welfare Minister Anila Bhediya and Urban Administration Minister Shiv Kumar Dahariya held talks with Kabir Panth followers to find a way out.
Tekam said, "In the whole state, child malnutrition is estimated at about 40 per cent. For their well being, we have decided to give them nutrition-rich food. Some organisations including Kabir Panth have sought that egg should not be included in the scheme. We will speak to the Chief Minister (Bhupesh Baghel) and then will take a decision." Former Chhattisgarh chief minister Raman Singh has demanded that the government should take into consideration religious beliefs before implementing any such decision.
"People have their religious beliefs and their feelings are being hurt. The proposal must be reconsidered. Milk also has protein and it can be given to students. There are many other options as well," he said.
Social activist Mamta Sharma, however, cited statistics on malnutrition in the state to bat for implementing a healthy diet. "If we see the statistics of the National Health Authority, we will observe that the number of malnourished children is on the rise in Chhattisgarh. Therefore, our children are in need of a healthy diet which includes egg. Children who eat egg can have it while others can choose not to have it. I welcome the proposal of including eggs in the Midday Meal Scheme."

Abortion will rise after media reports of MLA's daughter: BJP MLA
Madhya Pradesh BJP MLA Gopal Bhargava on Sunday said that the reports run by national channels on BJP MLA Rajesh Mishra's daughter Sakshi will lead to a rise in abortion and female infanticide across the country. There will be a huge difference in the sex ratio which we will see in social surveys over the next three years, Bhargava said.
https://www.financialexpress.com/india-news/bjp-legislators-bizarre-take-on-up-mlas-daughter-will-lead-to-rise-in-female-infanticide-affect-poor-gender-ratio/1644529/?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts
The Financial Express
Days after the daughter of an Uttar Pradesh MLA’s video of her seeking police protection from her father made headlines, another BJP leader blamed the media of covering such news to boost their TRPs. Gopal Bhargava, the Leader of Opposition in Madhya Pradesh, said that such stories would hamper the ‘Beti Bachao Beti Padhao’ campaign going on across the country. Bhargava also said that it would result in a massive rise in female foeticide and would also afftect the poor gender ratio.
“I believe that such incidents will now lead to unexpected increase in the incidents of female foeticide in the country, and there will be a huge difference in the sex ratio, which we will clearly see in the social survey over the next three years,” Bhargava tweeted in Hindi.

Without naming any TV channel, Bhargava said that such channels and their anchors were now becoming a curse for Indian families. He also said that, in his personal view, these channels were indulging in anti-national and anti-social activities to boost their TRP. “With this act, the country’s “Beti Bachao Beti Padhao” scheme and national campaign going on for the last decade will go back 50 years,” the BJP lawmaker said in one of his tweets.
Sakshi Misra, daughter of Rajesh Misra, MLA from Bareilly’s Bithari Chainpur, had appealed to her father to ask his men to stop harassing her. Sakshi and her husband Ajitesh Kumar had even urged the Allahad High Court to provide them police protection.
<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/eCgG2Bjd7us" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe>
In a video posted on social media, Sakshi asks her father to let them live peacefully. “I have married as per my own wish. I am not wearing this sindoor for fashion, I am really married now. Honourable MLA Pappu Bhartaul ji and Vicky Bhartaul ji…please let us live peacefully,” she says.

Free Press Journal
The Maharashtra government has approved the construction of a sub-center for Marathi Language Bhavan at Airoli in Navi Mumbai, this comes after Marathi writers protested for two weeks.
According to Indian Express, the Marathi Language Bhavan is being set up to bring all the offices of the Marathi language department under one roof for better coordination. The Maharashtra government has estimated Rs 17.66 crore as the cost of construction of the building. The offices under the Marathi language department such as the Directorate of Languages, Maharashtra State Board of Literature and Culture, Maharashtra State Marathi Encyclopaedia Production Board and State Marathi Development Institute and their regional offices will be accommodated at the Bhavan.
An official told the leading daily that while the sub-centre was being set up in Navi Mumbai, the search was on for a suitable piece of land in South Mumbai or Bandra Kurla Complex to build the main centre of Marathi Language Bhavan. Initially, it was proposed at Rang Bhavan near Dhobi Talao but the plan was dropped following objections from the Mumbai Heritage Conservation Committee, the official added.
A delegation of Marathi writers, including veteran Madhu Mangesh Karnik, former president of the All India Marathi Literature Meet Laxmikant Deshmukh and others had met Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis last month. They met to press for their demands of classical status to Marathi, building a language bhavan, among others.

K'taka MLAs write to Mumbai Police again, seek protection from Cong
The 14 Karnataka rebel MLAs, staying at a Mumbai hotel, wrote to the police again, seeking protection from Congress leaders who may try to meet them. "We have absolutely no intention to meet Shri Mallikarjun Kharge ji or Ghulam Nabi Azad ji or any Congress dignitaries or functionaries from Maharashtra and Karnataka...we anticipate a serious threat from them," they said.

India.com
Mumbai: Fourteen Karnataka rebel lawmakers have written to the Mumbai Police again, seeking protection from senior Congress leaders who may try to meet them.  Reports said Congress leaders like Mallikarjun Kharge and Karnataka Deputy Chief Minister G Parameshwara were set to visit the rebels at Renaissance Hotel in Powai. (Also read: Rebel MLA Stands Ground, Says Won’t Take Back Resignation)
The letter also mentions Ghulam Nabi Azad. “We have absolutely no intention to meet Shri Mallikarjun Kharge ji or Ghulam Nabi Azad ji or any Congress dignitaries or functionaries from Maharashtra and Karnataka Congress team leader or any other political leader… we anticipate a serious threat from them,” the letter said.
Last week, Mumbai Police had to restrain Congress leader DK Shivakumar from entering the hotel after the rebels had sought protection from senior leaders. Shivakumar was detained outside the Mumbai hotel on July 10 and was later escorted to the airport by policemen.
The Supreme Court said last week that no decision would be taken on the rebel MLAs till Tuesday. According to ANI, the rebel lawmakers may also approach the top court against the Congress leaders if they try to meet them.
Interestingly, the signatories to the letter include Congress legislator MTB Nagaraj, who on Saturday had agreed to come back to the coalition fold after being coaxed by Congress leader Siddaramaiah and Chief Minister HD Kumaraswamy.
On Sunday, however, he again arrived in Mumbai and accompanying him was BJP leader R Ashok. Some reports even mentioned state BJP chief BS Yeddyurappa’s personal assistant Santosh as accompanying him on the flight.
Sixteen legislators of the JDS-Congress coalition and two independent lawmakers resigned from the state Assembly last week, leaving the year-old Kumaraswamy coalition government in the doldrums.
If the Speaker accepts the resignations of the rebels, the coalition’s number will be down to 100. The majority mark will drop to 105. The BJP, which has 105 MLAs, also has the support of two Independents so its tally will reach 107.

A man was arrested in Gujarat's Rajkot on Saturday for threatening to set himself and his family on fire if the government didn't permit him to sell alcohol or run a gambling den. He was granted bail after he assured he wouldn't take any extreme step. He said he cannot do physical labour after losing a leg in an accident.

Times Now
Palanpur: A man named Yusuf Khan Sheikh was arrested in Rajkot's Mehsana on Saturday, July 14 for threatening to set himself and his family members on fire. The accused claimed that he would end his life if the government did not permit him to sell alcohol or start a gambling den. 
Allegedly, Sheikh had even written to the Chief Minister of Gujarat, Vijay Rupani and Director General Police (DGP) Shivanand Jha on April 25, seeking permission to start the said businesses. He resorted to threatening the police after the government did not respond to his letter. The police granted bail to Sheikh after he assured that he would not take any extreme step.
Sheikh said that he had wanted to sustain his family and since he had lost his leg in an accident, he could not take up any work that involved physical labour. Sheikh said that he wanted to sell liquor to people who had been granting the alcohol consumption permit by the Mehsana Civil Hospital. According to Sheikh, he was unable to pay for the school fees of his children as he did not have any source of income. 
Two members of the All Kerala Alcoholics Supporters Association stood in front of the Secretariat in Thiruvananthapuram on July 13 in support of people who consume alcohol. The two men held placards and demanded that the price of Indian-made Foreign Liquor (IMFL) be reduced. 
The two men said that the police should not harass the people who walk on the streets in an inebriated condition. One of the protesters said, "Government says toddy is the national drink. They say it promotes tourism and they sell it, too. But after drinking, the police are not allowing us to walk on the streets. They check us and physically torture us. If we say that we are just walking away properly, they put a criminal case on us saying we are preventing them from doing their duty."
Advocating the rights of people who consume alcohol, the protesters said, "Let the police catch those who drive after drinking alcohol and create problems at home but spare those who walk away without creating trouble for anyone." The two men said that alcohol should be included under Goods and Services Tax (GST) so that its price is reduced. One of them said, "The price of alcohol will be increased irrespective of any natural disaster or calamities. Around Rs 400 crore was collected through this industry after price hike following the recent flood."

New Delhi: The Rajasthan High Court on Monday asked lawyers to stop the practice of addressing judges as “my lord" and “your lordship".
A notice issued by Rajasthan high court said the decision was unanimously taken in a full court meeting on 14 July to “honour the mandate of equality enshrined in the Constitution."
"To honour the mandate of equality enshrined in the Constitution of India, the Full Court in its meeting dated 14.07.2019 has unanimously resolved to request the counsels and those who appear before the Court to desist from addressing the Hon’ble Judges as ‘My Lord’ and ‘Your Lordship’."
A bench of justices H.L Dattu and S.A Bobde in a public interest litigation in 2014 had observed that judges should be addressed in courts in a respectful and dignified manner, but it was not compulsory to call them "my lord", "your lordship" or "your honour."
"When did we say it is compulsory? You can only call us in a dignified manner...Don't address us as “lordship". We don't say anything. We only say address us respectfully," the bench had then said.
The Bar Council of India in 2006 had passed a resolution prohibiting the usage of such terms which are "a relic of the colonial past."

Leaving India big mistake, will return in 24 hrs: IMA scam accused
Bengaluru-based IMA Jewels ponzi scam accused Mansoor Khan, who is believed to be in Dubai, claimed in a video on Monday that he will return to India within 24 hours. "It was a big mistake to leave India...but certain circumstances forced me to do so," he said. "I don't even know my family's whereabouts in the country," he added.

Times Now
New Delhi: IMA Ponzi scam accused Mansoor Khan has released another video in which he has claimed that he would return to India “within 24 hours”. 
Khan, who is believed to be in Dubai after he fled from India last month when the scam into light, stated in the video that he had been unwell for the last few days which prevented him from coming back to India. 
In the video, I Monetary Advisory (IMA) group's founder alleged that he had been on bed rest for a month as his health had worsened. “I pray to god that I will be able to return to India within 24 hours on my own will,” Khan stated, admitting that “leaving India was a mistake.” 
He said, “It was a mistake to leave India in the first place but certain circumstances forced me to do so. I don't even know the whereabouts of my family in the country.” 
Khan further stated that he hoped the police would conduct a fair trial in the IMA Ponzi scheme that has allegedly duped several investors of crores of rupees.
A few days ago, Khan had released a video in which he had vowed that he would be returning to India “very soon.” 
He had also claimed that he was willing to disclose the names of the corrupt officials and bureaucrats who had allegedly extorted money from him and were responsible for the downfall of his business empire.
However, sources told Times Now last month that the prime accused in the Shariat Ponzi scam case had purportedly applied for a visa extension because his visa is set to expire on September 10.
According to the police, Khan has been involved in the Ponzi scheme in which at least 40,000 investors were duped. The Bengaluru Police had said last month that passport of the promoter of IMA Jewels had been suspended by Foreigners Regional Registration Office, Bengaluru. 
Last month, the Special investigation team (SIT) conducted raids at Syed Mujahid's premises in connection with the IMA scheme probe and later took him into custody. Mujahid is said to be a close aide of Khan.
Meanwhile, Karnataka cabinet minister BZ Zameer Ahmed Khan is also under the radar of the investigation agencies for his purported involvement in the IMA Ponzi scheme. In one of the affidavits submitted by Zameer Ahmed to the ED, the Congress leader had stated that he had sold one of his properties to the IMA Jewels for Rs 5 crores.

Sebastian Vettel apologised to Max Verstappen immediately after Sunday's British Grand Prix, acknowledging that he had ruined his rival's hopes of claiming a podium finish. Ferrari driver Vettel drove into the back of Verstappen's Red Bull after the Dutchman had passed him. Both cars spun off into the gravel before rejoining the race.
"Well, it was my mistake," said Vettel, who climbed out of his car at the end of the race and went to speak to Verstappen. He leaned into the Red Bull car's cockpit, shook hands and apologised. "Obviously, he passed me and then ran a bit wide, which gave me the chance to come back," said Vettel.
"Then, it looked for a second that he was going to the right and there would be a gap to the left, which didn't open -- and by that time it was too late and I crashed." Vettel had to pit for a new nose for his Ferrari car while Verstappen re-joined the fray and finished fifth, missing out on a possible podium finish.
Vettel was given a 10-seconds penalty and two penalty points by the stewards for the crash on lap 37 of the 52-laps race. "I spoke to him, he apologised immediately after he got out of the car, so that's it," said the Dutchman. "You can't change your line."
He added that he had also enjoyed his earlier battle with Vettel's Ferrari team-mate Charles Leclerc. "They were really good," he said. "I think he was a little bit sore from Austria so he was defending really hard.
"But it's fine. I'm all for that. Of course, I didn't want to take much risk in those battles to damage the car because I knew we were quite a bit faster. "I needed to pick my moment, but luckily the team did it for me with a good strategy and then it was looking good for a good result."

The 16-year-old, who was playing just his third grass court tournament, follows 1969 girls singles title winner Kazuko Sawamatsu in triumphing at the grass court Grand Slam.
Mochizuki said he had learned a lot from his compatriot, 2014 US Open finalist Kei Nishikori. "He's really nice," said Mochizuki. "He gives me a lot of advice. "Like sometimes I practice with him. I learn from him a lot. Yeah, he's smart." Nishikori, nine times a Grand Slam quarter-finalist, took to Twitter almost immediately to fete his compatriot.
"Huge congrats to @ShintaroMOCHIZU! Such an amazing tournament," tweeted the Japanese star, adding a thumbs up icon, a flexed bicep icon and several Japanese flags. However, it is not 29-year-old Nishikori who is his idol. "Roger Federer, I love watching him on TV, yeah," he said.
"I don't want to copy him, but I love watching him." Mochizuki said he had been mindful of his implosion at the French Open when he led 5-2 in his semi-final only to lose. He said the pivotal moment had been when he was a set up but break points down early in the second set and managed to hold.
"In the first set, I got broken twice," he said. "I wanted to hold my service game a lot. It was good. I played really tough. "He had some break points, but I just tried my best to hold my service game. "Yes, it was really important game for me."
Mochizuki admitted not being used to playing in front of so many people on Court One had made him reluctant to perform in front of them. "I'm shy, so I was like, Why do I have to do that?" he said. "But it was fun. It's so many people were there. I was a little bit nervous."
However, once out there he rather enjoyed playing to his audience, with one jump smash being a special crowd pleaser. "It was a big chance to do that, so I just did it for fun," he said. "It was easy ball. I just wanted to make people have fun watching me."

Oracle loses court appeal against $10 bn US govt contract
US-based Oracle has lost its legal challenge against US Pentagon's $10-billion contract for 'JEDI' cloud infrastructure, which it alleged unfairly favoured Amazon. The Federal Claims Court said there were no "organisational conflicts of interest" and because Oracle didn't meet bid's criteria, it can't allege prejudice in the bidding. The US can now award the contract to Amazon or Microsoft.

Oracle Corp. lost its legal challenge to the Pentagon’s $10 billion cloud contract on Friday, clearing the way for the government to award the contract to Amazon.com Inc. or Microsoft Corp. Federal Claims Court Senior Judge Eric Bruggink dismissed the company’s argument that the contract violates federal procurement laws and is unfairly tainted by conflicts of interests. Bruggink said that because Oracle didn’t meet the criteria for the bid, it “cannot demonstrate prejudice as a result of other possible errors in the procurement process."
The decision is a major blow to Oracle, which risks losing a share of its federal defense business if the Pentagon awards the contract to another cloud company. The ruling eliminates a headache for the Pentagon, which has been fending off challenges to its winner-take-all strategy in the cloud contract for more than a year.
“Oracle will likely be most threatened by this" decision, said Bloomberg Intelligence Analyst James Bach. “They stand to lose the most ground in the Defense market if the DOD decides JEDI is the end-all be-all."
Oracle looks forward to “working with the Department of Defense, the Intelligence Community, and other public sector agencies to deploy modern, secure hyperscale cloud solutions that meet their needs," company spokeswoman Deborah Hellinger said in a statement. She didn’t comment on whether the company plans to appeal the decision.
Elissa Smith, a Defense Department spokeswoman, said in a statement that the ruling “reaffirms the DOD’s position: the JEDI Cloud procurement process has been conducted as a fair, full and open competition, which the contracting officer and her team executed in compliance with the law."
Amazon Web Services, which was also a defendant in the case, said in a statement that the company “stands ready to support and serve what’s most important – the DoD’s mission of protecting the security of our country."
JEDI Project
The project, known as Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure cloud - or JEDI, an acronym intended to evoke “Star Wars" imagery - is intended to be the Defense Department’s general-purpose cloud for most of its systems and applications.
The Pentagon is investing in commercial cloud services, in which computing power and storage are hosted in remote data centers, to consolidate its existing technology products, embrace artificial intelligence and machine learning, and enhance its technical capabilities on the battlefield.
Vying for the contract became contentious as legacy tech companies such as Oracle and International Business Machines Corp. waged a fierce lobbying and legal campaign against the Pentagon’s decision to choose just one provider. Although they are long-time government contractors, those companies were late entrants to the cloud computing market and eyed market leader Amazon as a threat to their traditional revenue streams from the Defense Department.
In April, the Pentagon eliminated Oracle and IBM from the competition, leaving Amazon and Microsoft as the final contenders. Dana Deasy, the Pentagon’s chief information officer, has said the Defense Department expects to make an award in August.
Amazon Web Services was widely seen as the front-runner for the contest because it had already won a $600 million contract from the Central Intelligence Agency that helped it obtain much-needed security approvals. Microsoft is catching up to Amazon through its advancements in winning such clearances, as well as a recent cloud deal with the intelligence community and years of experience working with the Defense Department.
Partial Vindication
The ruling is a partial vindication for Pentagon officials who have battled months of allegations that its procurement process was corrupt, including the circulation of a 33-page anti-Amazon dossier around Washington that suggested improper personal relationships had given Amazon an edge. The Defense Department has also faced pressure from lawmakers, who criticized the deal for lacking enough competition from industry.
There are still potential hurdles for the Defense Department as it moves forward with the bid. Either Microsoft or Amazon could lodge a challenge of the contract with Government Accountability Office or in the Federal Claims Court if they were to lose. Oracle could also appeal the ruling in the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit.
On Friday, Chris Lynch, the former director of the Defense Digital Service, which designed the project, praised his former team for their work on the project.
“JEDI will immediately deliver much needed capabilities to the warfighter, deliver incredible capabilities that are built from the best tech, and it will change lives," he tweeted. “Couldn’t be more proud."
Contested Terms
Oracle’s lawsuit, which was filed in December, alleged that the Pentagon’s minimum requirements for the contract as well as its decision to pick just one winner violated federal procurement laws designed to ensure competition. The government has said choosing one winner would reduce security risks and better enable it to consolidate its technology products.
The suit also claimed that the procurement has been marred by conflicts of interest, including ties between former Defense Department officials and Amazon. At least two of the former employees were offered jobs at the company while working on the contract, according to the lawsuit.
The Pentagon determined in its internal review that the relationships had no adverse impact on the integrity of the acquisition process but said the department’s inspector general was looking into potential unethical conduct. Bruggink said in his ruling that the Defense Department’s determination on the allegations was not “arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law."

Wholesale inflation falls to 23-month low of 2.02% in June
India's wholesale inflation, measured by the Wholesale Price Index (WPI), declined to a 23-month low of 2.02% in June, government data showed on Monday. The fall was driven by a decline in the prices of vegetables, manufactured products, fuel and power items. The inflation fell for the second time in a row, from 2.45% in the month of May 2019.
https://www.financialexpress.com/economy/wpi-cheer-continues-wholesale-inflation-falls-to-lowest-in-two-years/1644433/?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts
The Financial Express
Wholesale price index (WPI) inflation rate fell to a 23-month low at 2.02 per cent in June 2019. WPI inflation rate was at 2.45 per cent in the previous month and the market expectation was 2.35 per cent. This is the second month in a row when the WPI inflation rate has come down. WPI inflation rate reached 5.28 per cent in October 2018, after which it did not reach that level.
It was the lowest wholesale inflation rate since July 2017, amid a slowdown in cost of manufactured products and a marked decline in fuel prices. WPI change rate in manufacturing fell to 0.94 per cent in June, which was 1.28 per cent in the previous month. WPI inflation rate in fuel was -2.2 per cent in June, which was 0.98 per cent in May.
Wholesale Price Index measures the changes in the prices of goods sold and traded in bulk by wholesale businesses to other businesses. WPI is unlike the Consumer Price Index (CPI), which tracks the prices of goods and services purchased by consumers. WPI tracks prices at the factory gate before the retail level.
Index for the primary articles group rose by 1.4 per cent and the index for food articles group rose by 1.1 per cent. Among the food articles, prices for marine fish rose by 6 per cent, pork, arhar, barley, peas, and moong rose by 4 per cent each and prices for fruits and vegetables rose by 3 per cent each. The index for non-food articles group rose by 0.7 per cent. Prices of raw rubber rose by 12 per cent, prices of fodder rose by 5 per cent and the prices for groundnut seed rose by 4 per cent.
At 3.18 per cent, retail inflation touched a 8-month high in June. Food prices were the biggest contributor to the price increase, but it remained below the RBI’s medium-term target of 4 per cent.

Hema has picked broom only in films: Dharmendra to fan on viral video
After Hema Malini was criticised over a viral video of her sweeping Parliament premises, her husband Dharmendra responded to a fan who asked if she has actually picked a broom in life. "Haan films main, mujhe bhi anaadi lag rahi thi," he replied. Dharmendra added he was good at using a broom since he helped his mother with household chores.

Times Now
Veteran Bollywood actor Dharmendra Deol is a pretty active on social media. The actor-turned-politician has been on a tweeting spree of late and day and in and day out, he has something interesting to share on his handle. Last night, the 83-year-old actor took to the micro-blogging platform to share a video, in which he was seen playing with a buffalo and its calf. The calf was trying to be fed by its mother and Dharmendra was hilariously seen talking to the animals.
What, however, caught hold of our attention is Dharmendra's another tweet, in which he was replying to a user who asked him whether his wife Hema Malini has ever picked up a broom in her life.
The user asked, "Sir, madam ne actually kabhi zindagi mein jhaadoo uthayi kya?" To this, Dharmendra replied, "Haan films main, mujhe bhi anaadi lag rahi thi. Maine magar bachpan mein, apni maa ka hamesha haath bataya hai. Mai jhaadoo mein maahir tha. I love cleanliness." Here, check out the tweet in question below.
 
 
The user then replied to Dharmendra's response, "Indeed Sir!!! Loved your impromptu yet most honest reply!!! Appreciate and respect you."
 
 
Hema Malini was recently trolled on social media when a video of her surfaced online in which she was seen sweeping the Parliament premises.
In the video tweeted by the Yamla Pagla Deewana actor, he can also be seen trying to guide the calf so that it could be fed by its mother but he later gives up. "Bachhde ko akal nahi hai, tujhe bhi akal nahi hai (Calf doesn't have a mind, you too don't have a mind)," he can be heard saying to the mother buffalo in the funny clip. "Bhainson ke sath bhainsa bhains banna padta hai," he adds, meaning to say that 'with buffaloes, you have to become a buffalo yourself.'
He captioned the 51-second clip, "My yong buffalo,s first baby. Neither mother knows how to feed her newly born nor baby knows how to to take milk from his young mom. But I will  make them easy with each other.A farmer cum Actor.(SIC)"

England is a winner because of stupid f**king rules: Anurag Kashyap
Filmmaker Anurag Kashyap, while criticising the ICC after New Zealand lost the 2019 World Cup final to England over boundary rule, tweeted, "England is a winner because of stupid f**king rules...New Zealand is a true winner." "@ICC has made cricket such a batsmen game...It's all about the batsmen scores and the wickets are treated like the lower caste," he added.

Times Now
The ICC Cricket World Cup 2019 final between England and New Zealand was meant purely for the neutral supporters. An absolute nail-biting thriller, the match went into a Super Over before the hosts were declared the winners. The Black Caps remained in the contest right till the last ball but quite a few strokes of bad luck denied them glory at Lord’s.
Many in India sympathized with the Kiwis and called them the “true champions.” Fans were also critical of the ICC rule, according to which, the team with more boundaries is declared the winner in case of a tied Super Over; the said rule became a decider in the high-voltage match that ended with the English team lifting the coveted trophy.
Bollywood actor Shahid Kapoor called the criteria for winning “absurd” and said that the “World Cup should have been shared.” Shahid, in a Monday tweet, wrote, “This World Cup should have been shared. If England got more boundaries. New Zealand took more wickets. So the criteria is absurd. All 22 of those boys gave their everything and no one was lesser. Then why do only 11 get to feel like they were the best.”



“I was not supporting either. Just watched a great match. And at the end just felt for the kiwis. England played amazing cricket. But so did the kiwis. They didn’t deserve to be second.  No way,” he said in another post.



Anurag Kashyap, on the other hand, slammed the ICC rule in a series of tweets. The director wrote, “If in a super over a country can win by the virtue of more boundaries then why can a country not win by the virtue of losing lesser wickets in the actual match? There is a serious problem with the your rules @ICC @cricketworldcup”



“Honestly speaking  @ICC has made cricket such a batsmen game and wickets really don’t matter. Its all about the batsmen scores & the wickets are treated like the lower caste. If there was equality between bowling and batting .. New Zealand would be a winner today @cricketworldcup,” he said in another tweet.



“England had a better kundli! NZ had the better game!!! #NZLvENG,” wrote filmmaker Karan Johar, taking a sly jibe at the English team.



For England, who are said to be the inventors of cricket, it is the maiden World Cup victory. New Zealand has never had a chance to get their hands on the vessel of cricket champions.

Awarding England 6 runs on overthrow a clear mistake: Simon Taufel
Ex-umpire Simon Taufel has said awarding England six runs on overthrow in World Cup final was "a clear mistake". The five-time ICC best umpire award winner added that England should have been awarded five runs as per the rules. He added that Ben Stokes and Adil Rashid had not crossed for their second run at instant of Martin Guptill's throw.
https://www.crictracker.com/awarding-england-six-runs-on-the-overthrow-was-a-clear-mistake-says-simon-taufel/?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts
CricTracker
It was one heck of a final at Lord’s! England and New Zealand had their moments in the game throughout and eventually, the boundary count decided the winner of the 2019 World Cup. But the moment which saw Ben Stokes unintentionally deflecting the ball to the boundary will go down in the cricketing folklore. It turned the game on its head in the last over and what should’ve been a win for the Kiwis, it went into the super over. England were awarded six runs of that particular delivery and it was a complete mishap on the part of the on-field umpires.
A former international umpire and member of the committee that presides over cricket’s rulebook Simon Taufel has now admitted that it was a grave error from the umpires. The incident happened when England needed nine runs off three balls. Stokes swatted the ball to deep mid-wicket which Martin Guptill and threw to the striker’s end in an attempt to run the batsman out.

But Stokes was back for the second run and he dived to save himself only to deflect the ball to the boundary with his bat. It was a game-changing moment as Kumar Dharmasena awarded England six runs. But if the cricket laws are considered, it was a clear mistake from him.
According to law 19.8 pertaining to Overthrow or wilful act of fielder which reads: If the boundary results from an overthrow or from the wilful act of a fielder, the runs scored shall be
— any runs for penalties awarded to either side
— and the allowance for the boundary
— and the runs completed by the batsmen, together with the run in progress if they had already crossed at the instant of the throw or act.
Ben Stokes and Adil Rashid hadn’t crossed each other for the second run when Martin Guptill threw the ball and the second run should’ve never been considered. To make things worse, Stokes shouldn’t have been on the strike either as the run wasn’t completed and Rashid should have faced the penultimate delivery of the match.
“It’s a clear mistake … it’s an error of judgment. They (England) should have been awarded five runs, not six. In the heat of what was going on, they thought there was a good chance the batsmen had crossed at the instant of the throw. Obviously, TV replays showed otherwise,” Simon Taufel said while speaking to foxsports.com.au on Monday.
The umpiring standards were questioned throughout the World Cup and the ICC should seriously look into the issue after two top umpires in Dharmasena and Marais Erasmus made a serious error and that too in a World Cup final.

The Financial Express
President Ram Nath Kovind on Monday appointed Kalraj Mishra and Acharya Dev Vrat as Governors of Himachal Pradesh and Gujarat respectively. Former Union Minister Kalraj Mishra has been appointed the Governor of Himachal Pradesh, replacing Acharya Devvrat. Devvrat has been appointed as the Governor of Gujarat.
This is the first reshuffle to the gubernatorial post after PM Narendra Modi-led NDA government came back to power winning Lok Sabha elections 2019.
Mishra, 78, had served as the Union Cabinet Minister for Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises during the first tenure of the Modi government. He was elected as Member of Parliament from Deoria constituency in Uttar Pradesh. He has also served as a Member of Rajya Sabha three times.
However, Mishra had decided against contesting Lok Sabha polls 2019 citing additional responsibilities the party had given him. “I will not contest elections this time, I have been given a lot of other responsibilities by the party so my time will be devoted to that,” Mishra had said.
After 2014, many BJP leaders, who had reached the age of 75, had retired from active politics. In 2017, Mishra had attributed his resignation to the same factor.
On the other hand, Acharya Dev Vrat hailed from a non-political background. Dev Vrat was first appointed Governor of Himachal Pradesh in August 2015. He has been credited for taking concrete steps against a number of social evils, including drug abuse in the state.
He had served as the principal of a Gurukul in Kurukshetra in Haryana. An Arya Samaj pracharak, Dev Vrat took up social issues such as those of farmers, drug-free society, village upliftment, Ayurveda and naturopathy and organic farming.

Will cut business ties with US firms that sell arms to Taiwan: China
China's government and companies will cut business ties with US firms involved in selling arms to Taiwan, China's foreign ministry has said. However, the ministry did not specify which companies would be affected. This comes after China threatened to impose sanctions on US firms involved in a deal to sell $2.2-billion worth of tanks, missiles and related equipment to Taiwan.
https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-taiwan/china-says-no-cooperation-with-u-s-companies-that-sell-arms-to-taiwan-idUSKCN1UA0N8?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts
Reuters
BEIJING (Reuters) - China’s government and Chinese companies will cut business ties with U.S. firms selling arms to Taiwan, China’s Foreign Ministry said on Monday, declining to give details of the sanctions in a move likely to worsen already poor ties with Washington. 
China claims self-ruled and democratic Taiwan as its own and has never renounced the use of force to bring it under Beijing’s control. China regularly calls Taiwan the most sensitive issue in its relations with the United States.  
Last week, the Pentagon said the U.S. State Department had approved the sale of the weapons requested by Taiwan, including 108 General Dynamics Corp (GD.N) M1A2T Abrams tanks and 250 Stinger missiles, which are manufactured by Raytheon (RTN.N). 
China said on Friday it would sanction U.S. companies selling weapons to Taiwan but did not elaborate. 
The latest deal involves $2.2 billion worth of tanks, missiles and related equipment for Taiwan. 
Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said the arms sales were a violation of international law and harmed China’s sovereignty and national security. 
“China’s government and Chinese companies will not cooperate or have commercial contacts with these U.S. companies,” he told a daily news briefing. 
“I can’t reveal the details at the moment. But believe this - Chinese people always stress standing by their word.” 
On Sunday, the ruling Communist Party’s official People’s Daily posted an article on its WeChat account identifying U.S. companies that could be vulnerable to sanctions. 
They included Honeywell International Inc (HON.N), which makes the engines for the Abrams tanks, and private jets maker Gulfstream Aerospace, which is owned by General Dynamics. China is an important market for both Honeywell and Gulfstream. 
Honeywell, in a statement sent to Reuters, said the arms deal was “a government-to-government sale, initiated by the United States government”.  
“Honeywell has no input into these agreements and has had no direct dealings with Taiwan. We are a component provider and do not decide where the products are used. We see no reason why Honeywell would be potentially sanctioned by the Chinese government.” 
The other companies did not respond to requests for comment. 
Ties between China and the United States are already strained over a trade war, which has seen them levy tariffs on each other’s imports. 
This is not the first time China has said it would sanction U.S. companies selling weapons to Taiwan. China has announced such steps at least twice before - in 2010 and 2015 - but it is unclear if the sanctions were ever imposed. 
U.S. defense contractors have been barred from dealings with Beijing since China’s bloody crackdown on pro-democracy demonstrators on and around Tiananmen Square in 1989. 
While its relations with Taiwan are technically unofficial, the United States is required by law to assist Taiwan in its defense and is its main supplier of arms, though France has also previously sold warships and fighter jets to Taiwan. 
China has been angered as well by the United States allowing Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen to visit last week, on her way to diplomatic allies in the Caribbean. She is due to transit the United States again at the end of her trip next week.

Hello Taxi's ex-CEO alleges ₹1,000 crore fraud by promoters
Delhi-based cab aggregator Hello Taxi's former CEO Saroj Mahapatra alleged that the company's promoters have siphoned off investors' money to the tune of ₹1,000 crore. He said that he and senior company officials are wrongly named in the fraud. Hello Taxi, which operates a multi-level marketing scheme and offers high returns, owes a huge amount of money to investors.

Livemint
New Delhi: A month after the first information report (FIR) was filed by a complainant against Hello Taxi, its officials and promoters, now former CEO of the cab aggregator company has also come out alleging financial anomalies by the promoters of the firm.
Senior officials of 'Hello Taxi' including former CEO Saroj Mahapatra have alleged that the promoters of the company have siphoned off investors' money to the tune of  ₹1,000 crore and they are wrongly made to face the wrath of those who were cheated by the owners.
Hello Taxi operates a multi-level marketing (MLM) scheme in the country and offers high returns to the investors. The company owes a huge amount of money to both big and small investors.
"To make people aware of fraudulent practice used by dubious companies, we at the corporate level, need to collectively condemn them and initiate all necessary legal action. Law enforcement agencies also need to be watchful of such conduct," said former CEO Mahapatra.
Alleging large scale financial fraud, he further said: "Since March onwards, I was absolutely sure that the financial fraud by the promoters was close to  ₹1,000 crore and I collected all proofs. I along with other senior officials had been trapped."
"We were made to believe by them that we are only employees on monthly salary and have nothing to do with the amount collected by the company. We were never a signing authority for financial transactions. On the basis on relevant documents, it appears that the promoters of the company have done a financial fraud to the tune of  ₹1,000 crore," he added.
Repeated attempts were made to Hello Taxi's official number for comments, but in vain as the response was either switched off/non-existent.
Mahapatra has also written to the office of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, alleging that the accused may attempt to flee the country. He has also submitted all proofs of fraud to the Prime Minister Office, Union Home Ministry, and law enforcement agencies.
Mahapatra has demanded the arrest of promoters for safeguarding the interests of investors.

Have sent resignation as Punjab minister to CM: Navjot Sidhu
Cricketer-turned-politician Navjot Singh Sidhu on Monday said that he has sent his resignation as a Punjab Cabinet minister to CM Captain Amarinder Singh and it has been delivered to his official residence. Sidhu had earlier submitted his resignation letter to Congress leader Rahul Gandhi instead of CM Singh. In June, Sidhu's portfolio was changed after a Cabinet reshuffle.

The New Indian Express
CHANDIGARH: Navjot Singh Sidhu on Monday sent his resignation to Chief Minister of Punjab at his official residence, ending speculations that ensued through the weekend following the announcement of his exit from Captain Amarinder Singh's cabinet.
"Today I have sent my resignation to the Chief Minister Punjab, has been delivered at his official residence," Sidhu wrote on Twitter.
The cricketer-turned-politician had earlier submitted his resignation letter to Rahul Gandhi instead of Amarinder Singh. It had remained unclear as to why the resignation was not sent to Singh in the past one month.

Singh and Sidhu have been at loggerheads since his controversial visit to Pakistan for the swearing-in ceremony of Imran Khan last year where he had hugged the Army Chief leading to a huge controversy back home.
The rift was further widened during the general elections when Sidhu and his wife accused Amarinder of having had a hand in the denial of ticket to her to from either Chandigarh or Amritsar.
On June 6, the Congress leader was stripped off the portfolios of local government and Tourism and Culture Ministry by the Chief Minister after the party won eight parliamentary seats out of 13 Lok Sabha constituencies in the Punjab state.

Appalled to learn of Sidhu's resignation: Shatrughan Sinha
Congress leader Shatrughan Sinha on Sunday took to Twitter to say that he was appalled to learn of Navjot Singh Sidhu's resignation from the Punjab Cabinet. Sinha said, "He has been a...talented and popular sportsman/politician...a wonderful human being and...a dear friend." "[W]e cannot question his decision, one would...pray for remedial measures soon towards...this unfortunate move," he added.

India.com
New Delhi: Just a few hours after Congress leader from Punjab Navjot Singh Sidhu tweeted out a copy of his resignation letter, party leader Shatrughan Sinha responded to the decision saying that he was “rather appalled”.
Sidhu, who has been at loggerheads with Punjab Chief Minister Captain Amarinder Singh since June, announced his resignation from the state cabinet along with his resignation letter that he had already given to the Congress president Rahul Gandhi in June.
Reacting to the resignation, actor-turned-politician Sinha said, “Rather appalled to learn of Navjot Singh Sidhu’s resignation from the Punjab Cabinet & Ministry! He has been a supremely talented and popular sportsman/politician. Above all, a wonderful human being and man in demand, who is also a dear friend.”
He added that they cannot question his decision, however, he hoped that the situation will soon be resolved.

Navjot Sidhu and Sinha have been on good terms since their days as Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) rebels, following which both switched to Congress. Sidhu had joined the Congress in January 2017, ahead of Punjab assembly polls. Similarly, Sinha had joined the Congress after openly criticising Prime Minister Narendra Modi and then party president Amit Shah.
However, there has been a rift between the Congress MP from Punjab and the state chief minister from the time the former went to Islamabad for the swearing-in ceremony of Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan.
The 55-year-old had, in June, blamed the governmental department in Punjab for ‘inept handling’ that caused the Congress’ poor performance in the Lok Sabha polls this year.

Worst not yet over in auto sector: Mahindra MD on sale slump
The worst isn't yet over for the auto industry amid a slowdown in sales, Mahindra and Mahindra's MD Pawan Goenka said. "I suggest...government remove the cess on small cars and keep 17% single cess rate for large cars for next four-six months," he added. Diesel vehicle costs are expected to rise after BS-VI emission norms come into effect in 2020.
https://www.financialexpress.com/industry/in-slow-lane-the-worst-is-not-yet-over-for-auto-industry-says-mahindra-and-mahindras-pawan-goenka/1644142/?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts
The Financial Express
By Malini Bhupta
The complete collapse in automobile sales has left many perplexed, with volumes expected to clock a modest 3-5% growth in the new fiscal. In the first three months of the financial year, passenger vehicle sales declined by 18.42%.
While several factors have come together to contribute to the sharp decline in sales, Mahindra & Mahindra managing director Pawan Goenka is of the view that it is hard to point to any one reason that can possibly explain the industry’s worst show in 18 years. “Even if I add up all the reasons for the slowdown, it doesn’t explain the kind we are seeing. There is something about this animal called ‘sentiment’ that is causing the slowdown. The concern is that the worst is not over yet,” he said.
In October this year, the new safety norms kick in for the auto sector, which will further ratchet up prices of the base variant of small cars by nearly Rs 20,000. Higher costs have already affected purchase decisions of consumers over the last one year, leading to a pile-up of inventory of 500,000 passenger vehicles. While consumers are deferring their purchase decisions, the cost of ownership is expected to rise even further by 2020, when the new BS VI emission norms kick in. The cost of a diesel car is likely to increase from Rs 10 lakh to over Rs 11 lakh.
Auto sales have suffered over the last one year due to rise in cost of ownership and tight liquidity conditions. While Goenka believes that the finance minister’s decision to infuse Rs 70,000 crore into public sector banks and the credit guarantee scheme for NBFCs is a great move, they may not be enough to revive demand, he said.
According to Goenka, the industry’s growth is not determined by people who can easily finance their purchases. It is the people on the margin who could get loans earlier but now are not getting loans very easily that determine industry’s growth. He believes that the measures announced in the Budget would help resolve the issue of financing, but it may not be enough to revive sales.
While Goenka understands that it would be unreasonable to expect the government to cut the GST rate at this stage, he is of the view that the industry needs a shot in the arm. “The thing that has always worked in the past is a one-time reduction for a short period. I am suggesting that the government remove the cess on small cars and keep a single rate of cess of 17% for the large cars for the next four-six months. It won’t be a major loss of revenue. And if this revives the auto industry, the returns will be much more than the cost”.
“Scrappage policy, setting aside TDS for above Rs 10 lakh cars, deferring non-critical regulations that add to cost may be other measures that could help without any revenue loss to the government,” he added. In any case, Goenka is optimistic that the industry has weathered many slowdowns and this one, too, will come to pass.

Singh had earlier called West Bengal Chief Minister as 'Supranakha' and said that BSP President Mayawati spends money on beauty treatments. No action has ever been taken against the legislator for making objectionable statements.

8 suspended, notice to 3 for negligence in cattle care in UP
Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath on Sunday suspended eight officials and issued show-cause notices to three others for negligence after 35 cattle were found dead in a temporary shelter in Prayagraj. Addressing the state's District Magistrates through video call, Yogi warned criminal proceedings in the future. He had earlier asked officials to ensure that cow shelters are self-reliant.

Lucknow: Less than a week after 35 cattle were found dead at a Prayagraj shelter, Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath has suspended eight officials and sent show cause notices to three officers, including the District Magistrate, for allegedly showing negligence in maintaining cattle.
The action came at a video conference Yogi held with all the District Magistrates in the state on Sunday evening. The Chief Minister also directed Prayagraj Commissioner to investigate all the aspects of the death of the destitute cow. He instructed the officer to determine the responsibility of the concerned.
Issuing a warning, Yogi said that in future, criminal proceedings could also be initiated under the Prevention of Animal Husbandry Act and Animal PreventionAct.
About the cattle found dead, police said they may have died due to lightning. “Prima facie it appears that 35 cattle have died due to lightning, treatment for others underway,” Bhanu Chandra Goswami, District Magistrate had told media.
Recently, the Chief Minister had directed officials to ensure that the cow sheds were self-reliant and all facilities were made available for the animals. In Jalalabad too, more than a dozen cows died due to hunger at a cow shelter of Kannauj district last week. The deaths triggered protests by locals outside the cow shelter.
According to the locals, at least 15 cows have died or gone missing even as the shelter workers took other 5-6 cows away on loaders.
Earlier this year, over 100 cows were reported to have died in some villages in Muzaffarnagar over two days following which an inquiry was ordered in the incident. The cows died in pastures and were suspected to have either eaten poisonous grass or consumed polluted water, Sub Divisional Magistrate Vijay Kumar said.
He said an inquiry was ordered into the incident and a team of revenue department along with veterinarians had gone to the areas where the bovines died to ascertain the cause. The cows had been brought to the pastures from shelter homes.

There were four suitable window periods for the launch of Chandrayaan 2 in the month of July – July 15 and 16 and then again during new moon on July 29 and 30. The launch window on July 15, which is just days before the 50th anniversary of Neil Armstrong first walking on moon, was missed.
The launch is unlikely to happen during the next three windows in July.
“The stages will now have to be drained to see what went wrong,” said an official, on condition of anonymity. 
The next window for launch will be in September.
The indigenous mission was first scheduled for March 2018 and delayed four times for making changes in the design of the lander and the orbit in which it would reach the surface of the moon. The July 2019 launch date was decided after a design change to the lander, a change in the orbit, and the new GSLV Mark III launch vehicle to carry the now heavier satellite.
India’s second mission to moon had been approved by the cabinet in 2008 just after Chandrayaan 1. Initially, Russia’s Roscosmos was supposed to develop the lander and the mission had to be postponed when Russia was unable to develop the lander on time and later withdrew after the failure of its mission to Phobos, the moon of Mars, prompting India to develop the entire mission on its own.

Ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) lawmaker Rajesh Mishra’s daughter and son-in-law were assaulted on Monday, minutes after the Allahabad high court ordered police protection for the couple days after they sought it saying they feared for their lives because of their intercaste marriage.
Sakshi, 23, and Ajitesh Kumar, 29, were assaulted in the court’s corridor. The police intervened and took the couple to the office of the court’s registrar general. They were later safely escorted out of the court premises.

Police said that there were around 500 people outside the court and some unidentified people from the crowd hit the couple. The attackers were not identified and no arrests were made until late on Monday. 
Sakshi moved the court last Thursday seeking security on the grounds that she feared for her life because her Brahmin family was opposed to her marriage with a Dalit. In her petition to the court, she said they were adults who got married on July 4 of their own free will.
Earlier on Monday, the court directed the police to ensure that Mishra or his family members do not interfere with the couple’s married life. It also directed the police to ensure the couple’s lawyer Vikas Rana is not harmed.

Justice Siddharth Verma also asked the couple to have their marriage registered. “If the marriage was not registered within two months, then this court order will automatically stand vacated,” he said.
The court also issued a notice to Mishra regarding the claims made in Sakshi’s petition. “Because of the seriousness of the matter, the court has also issued a notice to Rajesh Mishra to file his reply in the case and also directed that I may given security, if necessary, for my safety,” said Rana. 
Mishra issued a statement last Thursday denying allegations.

It is kind of silly: GoT's Nikolaj on criticism against final season

Pooja Batra confirms marrying Nawab Shah in secret wedding ceremony
Actress Pooja Batra has confirmed that she got married to actor Nawab Shah in a secret wedding ceremony. "[We] exchanged vows in Delhi, with only our families in attendance...We had an Arya Samaj wedding, and we'll register our marriage this week," she said. Earlier, reports of their marriage surfaced after videos shared by the couple showed Pooja wearing bridal choora.
https://www.timesnownews.com/entertainment/news/people/article/pooja-batra-confirms-being-married-to-nawab-shah-he-is-the-man-i-want-to-spend-the-rest-of-my-life-with/453887?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts
Times Now
Last week, reports that Pooja Batra and Nawab Shah got married in a secret ceremony started doing the rounds. It was after the latter shared a Boomerang video of a woman's hand adorned with a bridal choora. 
In a recent interaction, however, the actress has herself confirmed that she and the Tiger Zinda Hai actor indeed got married in a hush-hush ceremony. The private wedding was an only-family affair and took place in the national capital on the fourth of July. The two, as per the actress, met each other in February this year and by June, they made their relationship official via an Instagram post. 
In a report, the Nayak: The Real Hero actress was quoted as saying, “Yes, we are married. Nawab and I exchanged vows in Delhi, with only our families in attendance. Our loved ones kept asking us why we were delaying it (the marriage). I was simply going with the flow, but then I realised that he is the man I want to spend the rest of my life with, and there is no point in delaying it any further. So, here we are. We had an Arya Samaj wedding, and we will register our marriage this week.”
 



Here's the first photo retrieved from Pooja's social media handle.

Spilling the beans on how they met, she said, “I knew of Nawab by virtue of being in the same profession. However, we strongly connected after we were reintroduced by a common friend in February this year. I guess we reconnected at the right time in our life. We were in the same space emotionally and hit it off instantly.”
 
 
 
 
 
 
Revealing what she liked about him, she told the daily, “I have always respected and liked Nawab, and this time around, I was open to the idea of getting to know him better. A part of me wanted to see if there could be something beyond friendship between us. We share emotional and intellectual compatibility, and we don’t have to explain too much to each other. I like the fact that he is a family person.”
Talking about the proposal, she said, “During the initial days of our relationship, there was this one time when he came to pick me up at the airport, and according to him, he wanted to pop the question right then. However, he got nervous and dropped the idea (laughs!). He was ready to propose to me soon after we met. Eventually, he proposed to me in Delhi, and again when he came to meet my parents with his family.”
The Haseena Maan Jaayegi actress was earlier married to Sonu Ahluwalia, an LA-based surgeon, for nine years. They parted ways in 2011 and talking about that phase in her life, she said, “Everybody goes through phases. I survived one of the most difficult ones, as I was alone in a foreign country. But then, that’s life, isn’t it? You learn as you grow and your mindset also changes with time. Life is all about learning and getting better. Every relationship is different, what works for one couple might not work for another. But what I have realised with time is to be respectful towards your partner, because what you give is what you receive.”
Last seen in the 2017 movie Mirror Game, Pooja wants to take up quality work in India now. “I have been working in American shows, but since I’ll be spending more time in India from now on, I would like to take up quality work here, too,” she said.

I'll be apologising to NZ for rest of my life: Stokes on deflected four
Talking about the overthrow incident in last over of 2019 World Cup final, England all-rounder Ben Stokes said he told New Zealand captain Kane Williamson that he'd be apologising to them for the rest of his life. The ball had raced to the boundary for four overthrows after deflecting off Stokes' bat. The 28-year-old was named man of the final.
https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/cricket/article-7246645/Ben-Stokes-jokes-incredible-moment-helped-England-World-Cup-glory.html?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts
Daily Mail
Ben Stokes has joked that he will be 'apologising for the rest of my life' after the incredible sequence of events that led to England tying the cricket World Cup final against New Zealand - and then claiming a historic victory in the subsequent super over. 
Stokes was at the crease when, with just two balls to go, he desperately lunged to make his ground only for Martin Guptill's throw from the deep to hit his bat and ricochet to the boundary for four.
The incredible incident helped Stokes, who was born in New Zealand, hit 14 off the over to tie the game and send it to a super over, from which England emerged victorious in front of a jubilant home crowd.
Scroll down for video. 
Ben Stokes was scampering for a second run in the final over of the Cricket World Cup
Martin Guptill's attempt to run him out backfired when the ball hit the Englishman's bat
It then ricocheted away from New Zealand wicketkeeper Tom Latham and towards the rope
Speaking after the game, Stokes said: 'Playing against New Zealand is always a great event to be a part of. They’re a seriously good team and they’re great lads. 
'I said to (Captain) Kane (Williamson) I’ll be apologising for that for the rest of my life!'
The 28-year-old all-rounder was nominated as one of England's three batsmen in the super over and contributed eight of his team's 15 runs - a target which New Zealand fell agonisingly short of as they matched the total but lost the game by virtue of hitting fewer boundaries throughout the game.
Stokes lay prone on the floor as the ball ran away and down towards the boundary 
New Zealand's Colin de Grandhomme gave chase but couldn't catch up to the ball
England were awarded six runs after the ball went for four - they had also run two 
Stokes can't believe the scenes as England tie the World Cup final against New Zealand
England needed 15 runs off the final over at Lord's to win the World Cup. Ben Stokes and spinner Adil Rashid were at the crease.
1st ball:  Trent Boult bowls a superb yorker that Stokes struggles to get away properly. He manages to get the ball off the square but not much further and there's no run. 
2nd ball: The same story as Stokes tries and fails to heave the ball into the crowd. Instead, he digs down on another yorker and squirts it to extra cover. 
3rd ball: An almighty six. Stokes moves outside off and slog-sweeps it into an ecstatic Lord's crowd. Nine are now required.
4th ball: This is where the drama really unfolds. Stokes tries to launch a full toss but finds Guptill, whose attempt to run out England's dangerman goes horribly wrong as the ball hits his bat and runs away to the boundary.
5th ball: Another yorker, Stokes has no choice but to run for two. Rashid is run out but a precious run is in the bag and he crucially retains the strike. Two runs required. 
6th ball: Pandemonium at Lord's as England attempt two for the win but it ends with another run out. This time it's Wood who is out and the game is going to a super over.
He won the man of the match award for his contribution with the ball and his 84 from 98 balls - plus his heroics in the extra over.
Stokes added: 'I’m pretty lost for words. All that hard work over four years to get here and be champions of the world, it’s an amazing feeling. I’m pretty done to be honest.'
England required 15 off the final over chasing 242 to win the final have lost at the same stage on three separate occasions. 
The 28 year-old looked stunned after his heroics helped England to their first World Cup win
He held his hands up to apologise to the New Zealand team for the one-off accident 
There is nothing in the laws of the game that say runs should not be awarded if a ball hits a batsman and goes into the outfield.
However it is deemed contrary to the 'spirit of the game' to profiteer off such a slice of luck and typically batsmen will not attempt a run if the ball hits them when a fielder has attempted a run out.
However on this occasion, because the ball went to the boundary, four runs were added to the total.
Stokes cut a frustrated figure when he failed to score off the first two balls, but a beautiful strike over mid-wicket for six got the crowd on their feet. 
It was then that the game became even more chaotic. The Christchurch-born star smeared a full toss into the deep and set off for two. 
Opener Guptill tried to fire the ball at the stumps of the end Stokes was running at - but the England man's dive for desperation turned to joy as the ball hit his bat and deflected to the boundary.  
In the spirit of the game Stokes was unlikely to have run from the deflection, however because the ball went all the way to the boundary umpire Kumar Dharmasena had no choice but to signal for a four to add to the two runs scampered by Stokes and Adil Rashid.
After two more runs and two more wickets England were all out for 241, the same score managed by New Zealand earlier on in the day. 
That helped set up the dramatic finale that left the Lord's crowd in disbelief and England celebrating their first ever World Cup win.  
England won their first World Cup after making it to the final on three previous occasions

Twitter to begin testing 'hide replies' feature in Canada
Twitter is rolling out the 'hide replies' feature to its users in Canada for testing purpose. When users look at the replies, they'll be able to select any of them and choose "hide reply" option. These tweets won't be fully removed from Twitter as users will be able to tap on a grey icon to view hidden replies.
https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/11/twitter-will-start-testing-its-hide-replies-feature-next-week-in-canada/?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts
TechCrunch
Twitter  users are getting more control over which comments are visible in the conversations they start.
The company has been testing and talking about this feature since earlier this year, but starting next week, Twitter will actually roll it out to users in Canada.
As you can see in the GIF below, when you’re looking at replies to your tweets, you’ll be able to select any of them and hit the “hide reply” option. However, as the name implies, these posts won’t be fully removed from Twitter, just hidden from the default view — everyone will still be able to tap on a gray icon to view hidden replies.
Here’s how Twitter’s Michelle Yasmeen Haq and Brittany Forks explain the feature:
Everyday, people start important conversations on Twitter, from #MeToo and #BlackLivesMatter, to discussions around #NBAFinals or their favorite television shows. These conversations bring people together to debate, learn, and laugh. That said we know that distracting, irrelevant, and offensive replies can derail the discussions that people want to have. We believe people should have some control over the conversations they start.

As my colleague Sarah Perez noted previously, the current implementation is open to at least two criticisms — one, that it could allow users to hide critical viewpoints or fact-checking of their tweets (maybe quote-tweeting will be the better strategy moving forward), and two, that it still forces people to wade through potentially trollish or hateful content in order to hide replies.
Haq and Forks emphasize that Twitter is still looking for ways to improve the feature: “By testing in one country we want to get feedback and better understand how this tool can improve before it’s available globally.”
And yes, the timing of the news is a little awkward, coming right after Twitter went down for about an hour.
Jack Dorsey says it’s time to rethink the fundamental dynamics of Twitter

Delhi govt should work in harmony with Centre: Sitharaman
Union Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said that the Delhi government should work in harmony with the Centre and the municipal corporations for the development of the national capital. She said blaming the Centre and municipal corporations for creating hindrance in development work is "wrong". Sitharaman also accused the Delhi government of not being concerned about the cleaning of Yamuna river.

India.com
New Delhi: Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Sunday said that the Delhi government should work harmoniously with the BJP-led Central government and the municipal corporations for the development of the national capital.
“In a number of combination locks, there are three-tiers. If the numbers are matched correctly, then the lock will open. In the same way, the Central government is at the top-tier and the municipal corporations are at the lower level. But, Delhi government should get its number right in order to open the lock,” Sitharaman said at the ‘Cooperative Group Housing Society Maha Sammelan’ here.
“Hence, by blaming both of us and saying you are not letting us work, those who are saying such things is not correct. This is wrong,” she said in a veiled reference to the AAP government. Underlining that developing waterfronts brings a different dimension to urban living, Sitharaman accused the Delhi government of not being concerned about the rejuvenation and cleaning of Yamuna river.
“In Delhi, nothing is happening even after making so many efforts in cleaning the Yamuna river. The Delhi government does not have any connection with it,” she said. The Union Minister said that one of the major issues in urban living is housing.
“Prime Minister Narendra Modi said even before the Budget that there should be affordable housing for everyone by 2022. When we celebrate 75 years of Independence, there should be a roof over everyone’s head,” stressed Sitharaman. Taking on the Congress for questioning the Union Budget 2019-20, Sitharaman said the BJP gave a befitting reply to the opposition party.
“The Congress raised questions over the Budget in the Lok Sabha and the Rajya Sabha. Former Finance Minister P Chidambaram said that how we are going to achieve such numbers. But, we gave a befitting reply point by point without getting arrogant,” she said.
She said that it was becoming difficult for the Congress to level allegations against the “suit-boot ki sarkar” (pro-rich government) and added that BJP’s is a people-friendly government. Sitharaman underlined that the Central government will work closely with the housing societies in Delhi to iron out the issues faced by them.

It's good Navjot Sidhu resigned: Union Minister Som Parkash
Union Minister Som Parkash said that it was good that Navjot Singh Sidhu resigned as Cabinet Minister from CM Captain Amarinder Singh-led government in Punjab. He added, "It's the first time in the country that a minister's portfolio was changed and he resigned." In June, Sidhu was given Power and New and Renewable Energy Sources portfolios after a Cabinet reshuffle.

Ludhiana (Punjab) [india], July 14 (ANI): Union Minister Som Parkash on Sunday said that it was good that Navjot Singh Sidhu has resigned as Cabinet minister from Chief Minister Captain Amarinder Singh led Congress government in Punjab."It is good that he has resigned. It is the first time that I have seen some ministers whose portfolio was changed resigning," Parkash told ANI.Sidhu, who was given Power and New and Renewable Energy Resources ministry after a Cabinet reshuffle in June, on Sunday shared his resignation letter addressed to Congress president Rahul Gandhi."My letter to the Congress President Shri Rahul Gandhi Ji, submitted on 10 June 2019," he tweeted.The Congress leader chose to submit his resignation letter to Gandhi instead of the Punjab Chief Minister.Almost 30 minutes after the first tweet, Sidhu posted, "Will be sending my resignation to the Chief Minister, Punjab."It is unclear as to why the resignation was not sent to Chief Minister Singh in the last one month.Singh and Sidhu have been at loggerheads since his controversial visit to Pakistan for the swearing-in ceremony of Imran Khan where he had hugged the Army Chief, leading to a huge controversy back home.The rift was further widened during the General Elections when Sidhu and his wife accused Amarinder of having a hand in the denial of ticket to her from either Chandigarh or Amritsar.On June 6, the Congress leader was stripped of the portfolios of Local Government and Tourism and Culture by the Chief Minister after the party could only win eight parliamentary seats out of 13 in the state in the Lok Sabha election.

Vijayawada (Andhra Pradesh) [India], July 14 (ANI): BJP leader and former Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan visited Vijayawada on Sunday to take part in party's membership drive.Speaking to media here, the BJP leader said that Rahul Gandhi has quit as Congress president because he is unable to run it effectively."BJP has achieved grand victory in 2019 Parliament elections. The party came from scratch to top in many states. Congress became zero in Andhra Pradesh. TDP is also on the verge of becoming empty. Rahul Gandhi left his party as he is unable to run it efficiently, he escaped from the post of party president," said Chouhan, who is also the president of the BJP membership committee.Chouhan said that the people are rejecting the Congress party because it is filled with "fake Gandhis"."Come what may, the Captain should lead his party. Congress presidents in Andhra Pradesh, Telangana and Karnataka also followed his footsteps. Thus, the history of the Congress party came to an end in the country. That party is filled with "fake Gandhis". That's why people are rejecting Congress in all states," he said.The BJP leader also took a jibe at TDP leader Chandrababu Naidu saying that he wanted to be a national leader but failed miserably."Chandrababu Naidu wanted to become a national leader but he miserably failed. Naidu went on slamming Prime Minister Narendra Modi but could not explain what development works he did. That is why TDP also became a sinking ship," he said here.Chouhan said BJP will not encourage the hereditary politics which is being witnessed in AP."Andhra Pradesh is also witnessing hereditary politics, which BJP will not encourage. In Modi's rule, poor people, farmers and women are happy. Modi became an inspiration for world countries by leading the nation to development," he said.Speaking on BJP's membership drive, Chouhan said that they are planning to strengthen the party from booth level."The BJP has set a target of 25 lakh members in Andhra Pradesh. Modi initiated not only the members' registration but saplings plantation program as well. Many leaders are ready to join the BJP," he said."Chandrababu Naidu had accepted a special package and left special category status. Accordingly, the centre had provided funds in different forms. The centre gave Rs 17000 crores. But Chandrababu diverted those funds into his pocket. And during the elections, he campaigned against the BJP, which were full of lies," the BJP leader added. (ANI)

Ranchi: Bharatiya Janata Party's (BJP's) national working president JP Nadda on Sunday said that the saffron party will win more than 65 seats in the Assembly elections in Jharkhand that are scheduled to take place by the end of this year. "The state government and the organisation of the BJP are moving forward rapidly and the people will bless them with 65-plus seats," Nadda said at a press conference in Ranchi. 
Further, the acting president thanked the people of Jharkhand for their mandate as the BJP-AJSU party alliance won 12 out of 14 seats of the state in the recently concluded Lok Sabha elections while praising the Raghubar Das-led state government for working towards the welfare of the people and implementing schemes with responsibility and transparency. During the Assembly elections in 2014, the BJP had won 42 of the 81 seats.
Nadda said that the "double-engine" - hinting towards the BJP governments at Centre and the state - was providing the much-needed growth to the state and appreciated the initiative undertaken by Das in implementing various schemes. Earlier in the day, Nadda had participated in a plantation programme at Ormanjhi on the outskirts of Ranchi. 
The same sentiment was exuded by the state Chief Minister Raghubar Das who's set to become the first CM of the state to complete a five-year term since its bifurcation from Bihar on November 15, 2000. 
"Abki baar painsath (65) paar (This time we will cross 65 seats). There is not an iota of doubt in people giving an absolute mandate to us. We will win by a thumping majority as the message of development under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi has percolated down to the masses," Jharkhand Chief Minister Das told PTI. 
Hailing Prime Minister Narendra Modi for "solid foundation of development works", the CM asserted that BJP workers are always ready for elections. "Whether in Jharkhand or other parts in the country, people have seen and accepted the politics of development under Prime Minister Modi," he said. 
Calling the Opposition alliance a "partnership formed with selfish ulterior motives," Das said that the Opposition will lose their deposits in the ensuing elections. People of the state including the exploited, the downtrodden, the poor and the Dalits have seen development work and have rejected the Opposition."
"Jharkhand citizens have shown the mirror to 'mahagathbandhan' in the Lok Sabha elections. They were stumped by NDA's politics of development. This time too they will be given a befitting reply," Das said.
On the welfare schemes, Das said that the 'Mukhyamantri Sukanya Yojna' under which girls from 26 lakh poor families are set to be benefitted is going to be a gamechanger with girls belonging to families whose annual income is up to Rs 72,000 receiving a scholarship. "For the welfare of farmers, we have started 'Mukhyamantri Krishi Ashirwad Yojana' where farmers with an acre of land will get Rs 5,000 and farmers having five acres will get Rs 25,000, " Das told PTI.

Assam floods death toll rises to 11; over 26 lakh affected
The death toll in the Assam floods, which have affected over 26 lakh people, rose to 11 after four more people were killed on Sunday. Barpeta district is the worst hit with 7.35 lakh people affected, followed by Morigaon with 3.5 lakh people affected. The India Meteorological Department has predicted more rainfall in the state for the next 24 hours.

The New Indian Express
GUWAHATI: The flood fury in Assam has continued as the deluge claimed four more human lives on Sunday and affected over 26 lakh people in 28 of the state’s 33 districts so far.

The deaths were reported from Jorhat, Dhubri and Barpeta districts. With these, the death toll has risen to 11 in flood and landslides, triggered by incessant rains.

According to official sources, 26,45,533 people in 3,181 villages and localities under 103 revenue circles in 28 districts have been affected. The number of animals affected was 10,42,346 while cropland affected was in areas of 87,607 hectares.

The Brahmaputra and a number of its tributaries were in a spate, flowing above danger level at various places including Guwahati. The authorities have set up 327 relief camps where 16,596 of the marooned were taking shelter.

The Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) has predicted rains in the state in the next 24 hours. 

“According to forecast by IMD, there will be rains in Assam in the next 24 hours. As this is the first wave of the flood this year, the damage could be more,” Additional Chief Secretary Kumar Sanjay Krishna told journalists on Sunday. 

He said Dhemaji, Lakhimpur and Barpeta were the worst-hit districts. Some flood-affected people alleged that they were not getting relief materials. The bureaucrat, however, claimed that the relief materials were being distributed to all the affected people.

The flood submerged all national parks and wildlife sanctuaries in the state. In the one-horned rhino-famed Kaziranga National Park, the animals were fleeing to nearby hills to save their lives.

“The flood has submerged nearly 90 per cent of Kaziranga National Park. The animals have moved towards the Karbi Anglong hills. Except for a few, most of the rhinos were taking shelter on the highlands within the park,” the park’s director P Sivakumar told this newspaper.

The park authorities introduced “time cards” for vehicles from Sunday, fixing the highest speed limit at 40 km per hour. Some deer were run over by speeding vehicles on a national highway that runs beside the World Heritage site.

Meanwhile, the Assam State Commission for Protection of Child Rights expressed concern over children, adolescents, pregnant and lactating mothers facing the wrath of the flood.

“We have written to the authorities to provide adequate baby food, sanitary napkin, safe drinking water, medical kits and facilities and adequate number of toilets with water facility. Above all, no child should fall prey to the hands of traffickers,” the commission said.

4 dead, around 18 lakh affected due to floods in Bihar
At least four people have died and around 18 lakh were affected due to floods in nine districts of Bihar, an official report said. The report added that five rivers of the state are flowing above the danger level due to torrential rains in the catchment areas bordering Nepal. CM Nitish Kumar conducted an aerial survey of the flood-affected areas.

Times Now
Patna/New Delhi: Floods in the eastern state of Bihar claimed its first victims on Sunday with the deaths of four people. More than 18 lakh (1.8 million) people were affected in nine districts of the state, as per an official report. Among casualties, two were reported from Araria and one each from Sheohar and Kishanganj districts of the state.
The five rivers in the state are flowing above the danger level due to torrential rains in the catchment areas in bordering Nepal during the monsoon season, as per a report by the Disaster Management Department. 
According to the IMD, Northern Bihar received a record rainfall on Saturday with East Champaran reporting 214.92 mm rain, Sitamarhi 154.55 mm and Muzaffarpur 125.15 mm. Whereas in West Bengal, Alipurduars recorded 150 mm rainfall, followed by Coochbehar at 110 mm, Siliguri at 105 mm, Kalimpong 60 mm and Darjeeling at 30 mm in the same period. 
Chief Minister Nitish Kumar undertook an aerial survey of the affected areas in several districts earlier. 
The flood waters have affected 55 blocks of nine districts including Sheohar, Sitamarhi, East Champaran, Madhubani, Araria, Kishanganj, Supaul, Darbhanga and Muzaffarpur.
The worst-hit districts were Sitamarhi and Araria where 11 lakh and 5 lakh people were affected respectively, according to the report. The National Disaster Relief Force (NDRF) and State Disaster Relief Force (SDRF) have deployed as many as 13 teams for relief and rescue operations in the affected areas. 
The authorities have set up 152 relief camps in which more 45,053 people have taken shelter and 251 community kitchens have been set up to cater to those affected. 
CM Kumar held a high-level meeting to review the situation and later conducted an aerial survey of Darbhanga, Madhubani, Sheohar, Sitamarhi and East Champaran districts.
Incessant rains in North Bengal and Bihar continue to wreak havoc with several areas in both the states reported to be inundated. However, what's more worrying is the fact that the Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) has issued a warning of "heavy to very heavy" rainfall in both the states in the next couple of days. 
While sub-Himalayan districts of Darjeeling, Kalimpong, Jalpaiguri, Coochbehar and Alipurduar in West Bengal are bearing the brunt of these continuous rains, people living near the banks of Koshi, Gandak, Budhi Gandak, Ganga and Bagmati in Bihar have started to flee from their homes.

The New Indian Express
MUMBAI: Three resident doctors of the civic-run Nair Hospital in central Mumbai were Sunday attacked by the relatives of a patient, police said.
The incident took place in the evening after the patient, Rajkishore Dixit (50), who was critically ill, died during treatment, an official said.
"As the resident doctors declared the patient dead, 13 to 15 of his relatives stormed into the ward number 23 where he was admitted, and started abusing the doctors.
They attacked the doctors and the security guard as well," he said.
The relatives also damaged the hospital property, he said.
The injured doctors and the staff then alerted their seniors about the incident, following which they approached Agripada police station.
Based on their complaint, an offence under section 353, 332, 504 , 34 of the IPC and relevant sections of the Maharashtra Medical Practitioners' Act was registered against the attackers, he said adding probe is underway.
Meanwhile, the Maharashtra Association of Resident Doctors (MARD) condemned the attack.
In a statement, the MARD said, "We, the medical fraternity, are under tremendous mental stress due to the increasing assault and violence against us."
"We urge the deaf government to hear our plea and make a strict Central Protection Act for doctors.
"We demand that the state government makes necessary changes in the existing Doctors Protection Act and make solid norms against mob lynching," it added.
"At the college administration level, security audits, pass system and emergency alarm system should be made effective promptly and urgently," it said.

Iran ready to talk if US lifts sanctions: President Rouhani
Iran is ready to hold talks with the US if it lifts sanctions and returns to the 2015 nuclear deal it quit last year, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani said on Sunday. "We have always believed in talks," Rouhani added. US President Donald Trump's administration has said it is open to negotiations with Iran.
https://www.reuters.com/article/us-iran-nuclear-usa/iran-ready-to-talk-if-u-s-lifts-sanctions-pompeo-skeptical-idUSKCN1U90DQ?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts
Reuters
DUBAI/PARIS (Reuters) - Iran is ready to hold talks with the United States if Washington lifts sanctions and returns to the 2015 nuclear deal it quit last year, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani said in a televised speech on Sunday. 
U.S. President Donald Trump’s administration has said it is open to negotiations with Iran on a more far-reaching agreement on nuclear and security issues.  
But Iran has made any talks conditional on first being able to export as much oil as it did before the United States withdrew from the nuclear pact with world powers in May 2018. 
“We have always believed in talks ... if they lift sanctions, end the imposed economic pressure and return to the deal, we are ready to hold talks with America today, right now and anywhere,” Rouhani said in his Sunday speech.  
In an interview with the Washington Post newspaper, Pompeo dismissed Rouhani’s idea as “the same offer that he offered to John F. Kerry and Barack Obama,” referring to the former U.S. secretary of state and president. 
“President Trump will obviously make the final decision. But this is a path that the previous administration had gone down and it led to the (Iran nuclear deal) which this administration, President Trump and I both believe was a disaster,” Pompeo said. 
Confrontations between Washington and Tehran have escalated, culminating in an aborted plan for U.S. air strikes on Iran last month after Tehran downed a U.S. drone. Trump called off the retaliatory U.S. air strike at the last minute. 
Calling for dialogue among all to resume, France, Britain and Germany - parties to the 2015 pact - said on Sunday they were preoccupied by the escalation of tensions in the Gulf region and the risk the nuclear deal might fall apart.      
“We believe that the time has come to act responsibly and to look for ways to stop the escalation of tension and resume dialogue,” they said in a joint statement that was released by the French president’s office.  
Despite calling for talks with Iranian leaders, Trump said on Wednesday that U.S. sanctions on Iran would soon be increased “substantially”. 
Existing U.S. sanctions have targeted Iran’s main foreign revenue stream from crude oil exports, which Trump in May moved to try to eliminate entirely.  
In reaction, Tehran said it would scale back its commitments under the deal, under which it had agreed to curb its nuclear program in return for relief from U.S. and other economic sanctions that had crippled its economy. 
Defying a warning by the European parties to the pact to continue its full compliance, Tehran has amassed more low-enriched uranium than permitted and has started to enrich uranium above the 3.67% permitted by the agreement.  
“The risks are such that it is necessary for all stakeholders to pause, and consider the possible consequences of their actions,” France, Britain and Germany, which have been trying to salvage the pact by shielding Tehran’s economy from sanctions, said in their statement. 
Iranian clerical rulers have said that Tehran will further decrease its commitments if Europeans fail to fulfill their promises to guarantee Iran’s interests under the deal. 
The nuclear deal aimed to extend the amount of time it would theoretically take Iran to produce enough fissile material for an atomic bomb - so-called breakout time - from several months to a minimum of one year until 2025.  
Iran denies ever having considered developing atomic weapons. 
There have been two signs in the past week that the United States may be signaling greater openness to diplomacy. 
U.S. officials told Reuters on Thursday that Washington had decided for now not to sanction Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif despite Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin’s June 24 statement he would be blacklisted that week. 
On Sunday, U.S. officials said they had given Zarif a U.S. visa to attend a U.N. meeting this week. Iran’s mission to the United Nations said he had arrived in New York. 
Pompeo told the Washington Post he had granted the visa but restricted Zarif’s movements while in New York, allowing him only to travel between U.N. headquarters and the Iranian mission six blocks away, and to the residence of Iran’s U.N. ambassador. 
Pompeo declined comment when asked whether he or other U.S. officials would try to speak with Zarif this week or at the U.N. General Assembly in September, the Washington Post reported. 
While accusing Zarif of exploiting U.S. freedom of the press to “spread malign propaganda,” the U.S. secretary of state told the newspaper he would accept any offer to appear on Iranian television.

India says Deloitte misreading law against call for 5-yr ban: Report
The government reportedly told a tribunal that Deloitte was misreading law by arguing that the case against it should be dismissed as its term at IL&FS unit IFIN had ended when the fraud was alleged. "Fraud continuing till date on account of errant past auditor...can be covered under law," it added. India is seeking a 5-year ban on Deloitte India.
https://www.reuters.com/article/us-india-deloitte-auditor/india-says-deloitte-misreading-law-in-challenging-governments-call-for-ban-idUSKCN1U90AA?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts
Reuters
NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India has told a tribunal the local auditing affiliate of international accounting group Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu is misreading a key federal law as the firm seeks to avoid a five-year ban on new business, according to legal documents reviewed by Reuters on Sunday. 
Deloitte Haskins & Sells LLP is contesting the government’s call for the ban on the auditor for its alleged involvement in a financial fraud. 
The government has said it detected several violations of auditing standards by Deloitte and a KPMG affiliate while investigating fraud at IFIN, a unit of Infrastructure Leasing & Financial Services, whose debt defaults last year triggered fears of a financial contagion. Both auditors deny wrongdoing. 
Deloitte’s filing showed it last month argued the government case should be dismissed because it came after the auditor’s 10-year stint at IFIN ended. The last audit it did was for the fiscal year to March 2018. 
The alleged fraud began to be exposed last autumn and Deloitte said the law only allowed such a ban to be imposed if the auditor was actively auditing the company at the time, and didn’t allow the government to take into account the firm’s work over previous years. 
India’s Ministry of Corporate Affairs has countered, saying the law can’t be read in such a “narrow and pedantic manner”, according to its June 28 tribunal filing, which has been reviewed by Reuters and is not public.  
“A fraud that continues till date on account of errant past auditor ... can undoubtedly be covered” under Indian law provisions, the government said in its 13-page filing, adding Deloitte was misreading and incorrectly interpreting the law. 
The law was intended to “weed out an errant auditor from practicing so that corporate democracy, transparency and the economy of the country is not destabilizing”, it added. 
The case will next be heard on Monday at the National Company Law Tribunal in Mumbai.  
A spokesman for Deloitte told Reuters on Sunday it had been advised the government’s case was “not maintainable”, declining to comment further. It has previously said “it has been thorough and diligent” in its duties as an auditor.  
India detected auditing failures as part of its wide-ranging probe into alleged fraud and mismanagement at IFIN, which has also been investigated by several other agencies including the Serious Fraud Investigation Office and the central bank. 
The auditing firms gave clean audit reports and “miserably failed to fulfill the duty entrusted to them,” the government has alleged, saying the fraud at IFIN was “nothing short of organized crime, actively aided and abetted by the statutory auditors”. 
In its filing, the government also said that if Deloitte’s interpretation of law was to be accepted, it would mean any auditor who commits fraud, but resigns before legal proceedings are initiated against it, can’t be banned in the country. 
The KPMG affiliate accused in the case, BSR & Associates, has also denied the allegations and said it performed IFIN’s audit in accordance with the applicable auditing standards and legal framework. BSR audited IFIN alongside Deloitte in the year to March 2018, and then was the sole auditor for the 2018-19 year. It resigned days after the government filed the tribunal case last month. 
Whichever way the Indian tribunal rules, the government’s allegations have already cast a shadow on local operations of big foreign auditors, who audit many of the foreign companies in India, as well as large domestic firms. 
“We are already seeing evidence of some of our global clients being spooked by this and the extent of the punishment being sought,” said a senior partner with a global audit firm.

Gangwal limited his financial risk: IndiGo Co-Founder Bhatia
IndiGo Co-Founder Rahul Bhatia has said that while he had extended personal loans to finance IndiGo from fiscal 2006-10, Co-Founder Rakesh Gangwal remained in "safe harbour" with equity exposure below ₹15 crore. He added that his IGE Group and Gangwal had a financial risk ratio of 80:1. Gangwal attempted to de-risk himself and pushed for IndiGo's sale, Bhatia further alleged.
https://www.financialexpress.com/industry/indigo-promoter-spat-rahul-bhatia-group-says-rakesh-gangwal-limited-his-financial-risks/1643794/?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts
The Financial Express
Asserting that the arrangement between the promoter groups has been transparent from inception at IndiGo, Rahul Bhatia group Sunday claimed that Rakesh Gangwal always limited his financial risks and was making insidious efforts to create an unseemly controversy about corporate governance. In a reflection of the deep differences between the two promoter groups, InterGlobe Enterprises (IGE) Group has now issued three statements in less than a week seeking to clarify issues and reject the allegations by Gangwal.
Gangwal has sought markets watchdog Sebi’s intervention to address the corporate governance issues at InterGlobe Aviation — the parent of the country’s largest carrier IndiGo — where he holds around 37 per cent stake while Bhatia group has about 38 per cent shareholding.

“Even more significantly, during the turbulent period of a fledgling airline, it was left to the IGE Group, as a responsible founder, to fend for IndiGo. Gangwal was missing in action at that time and there were stages where he wanted to de-risk and pushed for the business to be sold,” the group said in a statement that also provided details about investments made by the two sides. Noting that Gangwal has much to answer, the group wondered whether there is sanctity in agreements entered into by business people – freely and at their own will.
“Do business ethics and morals permit a contracting party to walk away from its obligations at its convenience after it has enjoyed the benefits under an agreement and pretend to be a victim?,” it said. Referring to purchase of planes from Airbus, the statement said that the IGE Group and Gangwal gave a joint undertaking of support IndiGo in November 2005, wherein both sides undertook to invest in the airline at least USD 50 million (which then was about Rs 200 crore), and maintain that investment until the delivery of the last aircraft.
“As Gangwal was not going to take any further financial risk or obligation, IGE singly (though the undertaking to Airbus was a joint one ) took the obligation to further invest up to Rs 110 crore in IndiGo so that taken together with the then existing investment of Rs 99 crore, the conditions placed by Airbus could be met,” the group claimed. According to the statement, IGE Group continued to support the startup (IndiGo) without diluting Gangwal’s potential upside.
“Kapil Bhatia and Rahul Bhatia extended personal loans to IndiGo and personal guarantees to the banks for diverse financing needs of IndiGo such as pre-delivery payments, aircraft acquisition, and working capital requirements. “Starting from financial year 2005-06 at a level of Rs 143 crore of personal guarantees by financial year 2009-10, the aggregate financial exposure of IGE, Kapil Bhatia and Rahul Bhatia was well over Rs 1,100 crore… while Gangwal was in safe harbour with equity exposure of less than Rs 15 crore,” it noted. Further, the group said that there was a “risk ratio of almost 80:1 as between the IGE Group and Gangwal”.
Personal guarantees of Kapil Bhatia and Rahul Bhatia continued to be in force until end of financial year 2012 and by that time IndiGo — which Gangwal equates to a ‘paan ki dukaan’ (betel shop) — had an adequate balance sheet to support itself, the statement claimed.
Kapil Bhatia is the father of Rahul Bhatia. Gangwal has raised concerns about shareholders’ agreement that provides more powers to Bhatia group and about various related party transactions. “The rights and obligations as shareholders of IndiGo were enshrined in the shareholders agreement to reflect their agreement and understandings in relation to the governance, management and operation of IndiGo… the deal was struck between seasoned business people who made their own assessment of risks, their rights, and their obligations,” the statement said.

No 'Greta effect' on Lufthansa's passenger numbers, says CEO
Lufthansa expects the number of its passengers to rise four per cent this year, not seeing any "Greta effect" on booking levels, the German airline's CEO Carsten Spohr said. This follows activists led by 16-year-old Swedish activist Greta Thunberg boycotting air travel amid carbon emission concerns. "Climate change discussions aren't causing restraint with bookings. People want to fly," he said.
https://www.reuters.com/article/us-lufthansa-ceo/lufthansa-ceo-sees-no-greta-effect-on-passenger-numbers-idUSKCN1U9062?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts
Reuters
ZURICH (Reuters) - German airline Lufthansa (LHAG.DE) expects passenger numbers to rise about 4% this year, its chief executive told a newspaper, playing down talk that public support for teenage climate activist Greta Thunberg might be curbing air travel.  
“At this time we don’t see restraint - in fact, the opposite,” Carsten Spohr told the NZZ am Sonntag newspaper in the interview published on Sunday.  
“In comparison to last year, already a record year, we’re expecting passenger growth of about 4 percent, (Lufthansa unit) Swiss International Air Lines is also showing growth. The discussion of climate change is not leading to restraint with bookings. People want to fly.” 
Media reports have suggested a “Greta effect” might curb demand for air travel, referring to the 16-year-old who has gained global attention for her efforts to convince people to reduce carbon-emitting activities. 
On Saturday, a group of about 80 protesters staged a “Flight Strike” at Zurich Airport near the facilities of Swiss International Air Lines, singing songs, handing out leaflets, and encouraging people to pledge not to fly in 2020.  
There were no arrests, and the demonstration dispersed without police intervention. 
Spohr cited figures from the International Energy Agency showing air travel produces 2.8% of human-caused carbon dioxide.  
He is frustrated that airlines are on the defensive over their contribution to climate-changing emissions. 
“We haven’t succeeded in explaining that air travel influences the world positively: We connect countries, economies and societies together,” Spohr, a trained pilot, told the newspaper. “Moreover, for years we’ve been able to reduce our per-passenger CO2 emissions.” 
Spohr said flights offered by discount or budget airlines for just a few dollars were hurting the sector’s image. 
“They’re making our industry the target of criticism and clogging up the airspace, because an artificial demand is being stimulated that wouldn’t exist if there were realistic prices,” he said.  
“There should not be flights under 10 euros.” 
He defended Lufthansa unit Eurowings offering flights for under 35 euros, citing the need to defend its home market. 
Friends of the Earth estimates aviation emissions more than doubled between 1990 and 2016, while overall emissions fell by 43%. In Europe, low aviation taxes, a proliferation of budget airlines like easyJet (EZJ.L) and Ryanair (RYA.I) and the rise of Airbnb have spurred an air-travel boom. 
Nations including the Netherlands and France are seeking to convince fellow European countries to end tax exemptions on jet fuel and plane tickets.

Mumbai (Maharashtra) [India], July 14 (ANI): Amid Congress' efforts to woo its rebel MLAs, Hoskote legislator MTB Nagraj continues to flip-flop the sides as he again arrived at Renaissance Hotel here on Sunday where other lawmakers are staying.This comes a day after Nagraj had softened his stand and agreed to withdraw his resignation after meeting party leader and former Chief Minister Siddaramaiah. Nagraj late on Saturday night announced that he was withdrawing his resignation and would remain with the Congress party.But today, he reached Mumbai where he met dissident MLAs. However, the legislator maintained that he is not here to convince them to change their decision. "I am not here to convince them but to support them," he said. Nagraj's statement contradicts Siddaramaiah's remark claiming that he was confident of getting most MLAs on board in the floor test of the Congress-JDS coalition government.Nagaraj and Chikballapur Congress MLA K Sudhakar Rao were among the rebel Congress-JDS MLAs, who resigned from the Assembly on July 10."Sudhakar and I had resigned from MLA's post. All the leaders are asking me to stay in the Congress since morning. I have decided to stay in the party," Nagraj told media persons in Bengaluru last night.Meanwhile, Congress MLA ST Somshekhar held a press conference here and said: "We won't take our resignations back. Sudhakar Rao is in Delhi and he is also in our support. He may join us in Mumbai anytime soon."Asked if they are being supported by BJP leader R Ashok, he said: "Ashok has nothing to do with us. He has no link with us and we are unaware of why is he here?"He said that all rebel MLAs here are united, but there is news being run that we have differences but that is "incorrect".On July 11, the dissident MLAs returned to the hotel here after meeting Karnataka Assembly Speaker KR Ramesh Kumar in Bengaluru.The Supreme Court had directed them to meet the Speaker and resubmit their resignations afresh.In a twist to Karnataka political stalemate, the apex court on July 12 had ordered a status quo until July 16 on a plea filed by 10 dissident MLAs of Congress and JD(S) seeking a direction to the Assembly Speaker to accept their resignation and not proceed with the applications for their disqualification.

The News Minute
In a tragic incident, a 20-year-old woman from Karnataka lost her life while filming a clip for Tik Tok. The incident took place in Kolar, 75 km away from Bengaluru, on Friday evening.
According to media reports, 20-year-old Mala, a final year BA student, died after falling into a farm pond while trying to enact a scene from a movie in Kolar district’s Vedagiri. Her father told the police that the incident occurred when she went out to get cattle fodder.
The Times of India reported that Mala was known for her love for selfies. Her college principal told the newspaper that she had recently received a Rs 10,000 scholarship for doing well in her studies.
Mala is survived by her father, mother and siblings. Following her death, her family buried her body late on Friday night.
Upon learning about the incident, the police exhumed the body and conducted an autopsy. They are yet to trace the mobile phone used to shoot the video. The Kolar Rural police station is investigating a case of unnatural death. 
This incident is not the first time that people have been injured attempting to perform stunts for social media. Several deaths have earlier been reported as the result of people attempting to recreate various stunts or photos to post on social media.
In one of the most recent cases, a Tumakuru man broke his neck while trying to do a backflip for a TikTok clip. In a widely shared video, he was seen landing on his head while trying to the backflip. He was admitted to the hospital but succumbed to his injuries a week later.

Times Now
New Delhi: The driver of a mysterious car which sent the Delhi Police in a tizzy after performing dangerous stunts on the heavily-guarded Vijay Chowk area on Saturday has been identified. The driver, Sarvesh Sandhu, is the nephew of Haryana Finance Minister Captain Abhimanyu. 
Sarvesh’s dangerous stunts on the country’s most iconic pathway created a furore on social media when the video of the incident viral online. Sarvesh is the son of the BJP leader’s brother Rudra Sen Sindhu. The incident which took place at 4 am on Saturday was captured on the CCTV cameras installed in the area.
The sound of the engine and the screeching tyres alerted the security personnel deputed in the area. The sounds reportedly were loud enough to send a news crew in its vicinity to head for cover. 
After the incident came to fore, the Delhi Police launched a massive hunt for the car and located it to Delhi farmhouse. The Nissan GT-R sports car costing Rs 2 crore owned by Sarvesh was found from a farmhouse in Delhi’s Kapasera area. 
The police said the sports car was being driven by Sarvesh at the time of the incident. The police said he is fond of sports cars. 
As per preliminary probe, Sarvesh initially drove smoothly but on seeing a vacant road, he took shard turns and rounds around a police barricade. The incident occurred in the middle of the high-security Rajpath-Vijay Chowk intersection. 
Police said a challan will be issued to Sarvesh for dangerous driving under the Motor Vehicle Act.

Internship at White House worst career advice I've received: Lewinsky
American television personality Monica Lewinsky today tweeted that "an internship at the White House will be amazing on your resume" is the worst career advice she's ever received. Over 20 years ago, former US President Bill Clinton and Lewinsky, a White House intern, were named in a sex scandal. Clinton was impeached by the House for lying about the affair.
https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-7245935/Monica-Lewinsky-jokes-bad-career-advice-20-years-Bill-Clinton-impeached-affair.html?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts
Daily Mail
Monica Lewinsky continues to show a sense of humor about her affair with her former boss Bill Clinton, two decades after the president was impeached by the House for lying about their relationship.
As is usually the case, Lewinsky found a way to joke about her Oval Office rendezvouses on social media as she responded to a tweet posted bt organizational psychologist and fellow Ted-talker Adam Grant.
'What’s the worst career advice you’ve ever received?' Grant asked his followers.  
More than 700 people responded to the tweet in the 24 hours after it was posted, but Lewinsky provided what was by far the most amusing, and specific, response to that question.
'An internship at the White House will look amazing on your resume,' wrote Lewinsky.
She then added an emoji of a blushing face. 
Scroll down for video
I'm with her: Monica Lewinsky (above with Bill Clinton in the Oval Office after he delivered his weekly radio address in 1997)  responded to a tweet asking people on the social media platform to share the worst career advice they had ever received
Oh-well office: Lewinsky's internship resulted in her being hired as an aide at the White House Office of Legislative Affairs in December 1995 (tweet above)
Thousands of people retweeted and liked Lewinsky's tweet, while many of the comments noted how incredible it is that she maintains her sense of humor about the affair.
The Clintons do not feel the same, and have continued to publicly dismiss Lewinsky on the few occasions when they are asked about the relationship.
In June of last year, Clinton was asked by Craig Melvin if he ever apologized to Lewinsky, and if he felt that he needed to apologize to the former staff member he engaged in sex acts with at their place of employment. 
'No, I do—I do not. I’ve never talked to her,' said Clinton.
'But I did say, publicly, on more than one occasion, that I was sorry. That’s very different. The apology was public.'
Hillary is similarly not with her, and said it was 'absolutely not' an abuse of power when the leader of the free world began having a affair with an aide on CBS Sunday Morning last year. 
She then explained that the reason it was not an abuse of power was because Lewinsky 'was an adult.' 
Despite that open contempt, Lewinsky has said that she wishes she could offer both Hillary and her daughter Chelsea an apology in person. 
Lewinsky has become increasingly comfortable discussing the affair in the past few years, and in the wake of the #MeToo movement many have identified the dynamic between herself and Clinton as a clear abuse of power.
At the same time, she has also turned the personal hell she was forced to endure when news of the affair was leaked into a anti-bullying rally cry.
Tears of a clown: Clinton was later impeached by the House for lying about the affair (above in 1999 after the Senate voted not to impeach), and both he and his wife Hillary have made no secret of their contempt for Lewinsky
That pathos was on display back in December, when Lewinsky spoke at the annual Women in Entertainment breakfast in Los Angeles.
The focus of that speech was the fact that every single person will make a mistake at some point in their career.
She joked early on that her most notable mistake was probably a bit more serious than every single other person in the room, a line that drew laughter from those in attendance.
Lewinsky also had some fun introducing herself to the young woman in the mentorship program that the annual event benefits, finding a way to introduce herself to the future female leaders who were born after her Oval Office liaisons were front page news. 
'Some of you — if you know the music of Eminem, Kid Cudi, G-Eazy and, of course, Beyonce — may have probably heard of me in a couple of their songs,' noted Lewinsky.
Prior to that she gave a more concise overview, summarizing her fame by stating: 'I am a former beret model who is also a lyric in songs.'  
Turning serious, the former intern-turned-White-House-aide then explained to the young women that every person in the room has 'made a mistake in our career that has come with consequence.'
She continued: 'Like breathing and change, mistakes are a guaranteed part of life. They can be found in the history of every successful person, and they are often the seed of every downfall.'
Lewinsky then added however that mistakes 'can be rich with learning and growth, even when they are painful and devastating.'
As an example, Lewinsky shared a story about her time testifying in front of a grand jury.
'At the conclusion of my second or third time there, the foreperson of the grand jury, who was actually a stranger to me, said: "Monica, none of us in this room is perfect, we all fall and we fall several times a day. The only difference between your age and my age, is now, I get up faster,"' said Lewinsky.
'I have now lived long enough to know that she was 100 percent right.'
In closing out, Lewinsky also quoted a line from comedian Hannah Gadsby, saying: 'There is nothing more powerful than a broken woman who has rebuilt herself.'
That is exactly how Lewinsky was described that day when introduced at the event by Lena Dunham. 
'Let's give a hand for a woman who rises again and again, who refuses to allow labels and preconceptions to prevent her from using her big beautiful voice,' said Dunham.

Vijender Singh remains unbeaten, wins 11th professional bout
Indian boxer Vijender Singh continued his unbeaten run after clinching a Technical Knockout over Mike Snider, on his debut in the US professional circuit on Sunday.

Indian boxing superstar Vijender Singh, on his US debut, defeated an experienced Mike Snider on Saturday. Notching up a Technical Knockout over his opponent, the 33-year-old boxer from Haryana won the bout, what was a super middleweight eight-rounder, in just four rounds. He has now won 11th consecutive bouts, with eight knockouts, since his debut in the professional circuit and is yet to lose one.
The referee decided to give the bout to the Indian after Snider was cornered with a flurry of punches by Vijender. The 38-year-old Snider was pushed on to the back foot right from the beginning as he kept flailing his arms for punches without any significant force to his opponent for most of the match.

Despite taking the ring for his first bout in more than a year, Vijender was sharp and agile like always and dismissed all the threats that were possessed by his local opponents. From the very first minute of the match, he made Snider look like an underdog and thwarted his feeble attacks quite easily. Snider came into the fight with an overall record of 13-5-3. Vijender would be aiming to compete in two more fights this year after signing up with Hall of Famer Bob Arum’s Top Rank Promotions.
A former WBO Aisa Pacific Champion, Vijender Singh recently contested in Indian General Election from the South Delhi seat and lost.

Speaker doesn't have right to disqualify anybody: Yeddyurappa
BJP Karnataka President BS Yeddyurappa on Sunday said the Speaker doesn't have the right to disqualify anybody because of the Supreme Court's decision.

India.com
Bengaluru: The former Chief Minister of Karnataka and Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader BS Yeddyurappa responded to the claims that if rebel MLAs vote against the government, they will be disqualified.
BJP Karnataka president said that the Speaker doesn’t have the right to disqualify anybody because of the Supreme Court’s decision.

On Friday, the Supreme Court ordered to maintain the status quo on resignations of the 10 rebel MLAs.
While Congress leader DK Shivakumar had expressed confidence to take the rebel MLAs back in the fold after yesterday’s meeting with MTB Nagaraj, one of the rebel MLAs, Nagaraj today reached Mumbai with BJP leader R Ashok.
Nagaraj had met Shivakumar yesterday and said that assured Congress to reconsider the resignation stating that he has spent decades in the grand old party.
“There are ups and downs in every family. We should forget everything and move forward. Happy that MTB Nagaraj has assured us that he will stay with us,” said Shivakumar after the meeting.
On July 10,  Shivakumar camped outside the hotel Rennaisance in Mumbai to meet the disgruntled MLAs after he was barred from entering the hotel. He was later detained by the Mumbai police and deported back to Bengaluru.
He complained that he was forcibly deported to Bengaluru and alleged that everything was done on the behest of BJP who were sitting inside the hotel.
The Congress has been accusing the BJP of conspiring to topple Congress-JD(S) coalition government in Karnataka.

Make mother tongue mandatory for primary schools: VP Naidu
Vice President Venkaiah Naidu on Saturday said that every state government should make the medium of instruction in the mother tongue mandatory up to class 5 or 8.

"Don't impose any language, but don't oppose any language too," Naidu said.

Mysuru (Karnataka) [India], Jul 14 (ANI): Vice President M Venkiah Naidu has stressed that there should be no imposition to any language while maintaining that there must also not be opposition to any.Inaugurating the golden jubilee celebrations of the Central Institute of Indian Languages (CIIL) here on Saturday, the Vice President said, "Language should become a catalyst for inclusive development."He added that the promotion of one language was not tantamount to undermining or opposing other languages."Languages must unite us in the cause for inclusive and sustainable development and must not end up as tools to divide us. There should be no imposition of any language nor should there be opposition to any language," the Vice President noted.Calling for a multi-pronged approach to preserve and develop Indian languages, Naidu said that it was time to rethink and reinvent the entire language education in our country."We must start by making the mother tongue the medium of instruction in schools at least at the primary level or up to 8th grade," he suggested.The Vice President also advised every state government to make the medium of instruction in mother tongue mandatory up to 5th or 8th grade. He also wanted the state governments to link employment with the native language up to a certain level."Every officer must be familiar with the local language," Naidu said.The Vice President suggested that the signboards on shops, establishments and other institutions must be represented in the local language or any other language of choice."In a democracy, especially in a knowledge economy like India, we must not foster the tendency to discriminate between people based upon their ability or inability to speak a particular language," he said.Emphasising the importance of protecting and conserving India's unique and rich linguistic heritage, the Vice President said it was extremely disheartening to learn that 196 languages of the country are classified as endangered."We have to ensure that this number does not increase. We have to protect and preserve our languages and the best and only way is to constantly use them," Naidu said.He described protecting and preserving Indian languages as true nationalism and patriotism, saying that "languages are the lifeblood of identity and play a significant role in strengthening bonds among people."

I-T Dept snooping people's social media a misconception: CBDT
The notion that Income Tax Department snoops people's spending patterns on social media platforms to find tax evaders is a "misconception", Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) Chairman PC Mody said. "We already get to know actual...financial transactions of people from authentic sources," he said. However, he said CBDT has deployed a data analytics system to profile entities' transaction trail.
https://www.timesnownews.com/business-economy/article/misconception-to-think-taxman-snoops-on-social-media-posts-cbdt/453698?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts
Times Now
New Delhi: It is a "misconception" to think that the Income Tax Department is snooping on social media posts related to exotic foreign tours or possession of expensive goods to check undisclosed income, a top official has said. CBDT Chairman P C Mody told PTI during an interview that the tax department does not need to undertake such measures as it is empowered to obtain various information and data sets from multiple agencies and possesses a strong data analytics setup to work out the source and destination of high-value transactions.
He was asked if the taxman or the I-T Department scans Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and other social media handles of people to obtain secret information about their income and spending behaviour as reported in the past in multiple media reports.
It has been reported that the taxman will keep a secret eye on social media posts to find out who is undertaking an expensive foreign trip or is flaunting their expensive vehicle or other goods over these platforms, in order to ensure such people or entities pay their due taxes. "That is a misconception. Why do we need to go on (social media platforms)?," the CBDT boss told the news agency.
"We already get to know actual travel details or other financial transactions of a person from authentic sources," he said. The CBDT is the policy-making body for the I-T department. He added that the Board has deployed an advanced data analytics system that mines and churns a lot of figures and data to understand which sectors should be taxed and where can relief be extended.
The tax department has named this new system as 'Project Insight', as it provides a 360-degree profiling and insight into an entities' complete transactions trail. Mody said the department, backed by these systems, is now working to start an SMS-based service where a person will be intimated about at least 18 different types of transactions they have undertaken above a certain threshold of money.
"This is to promote a non-adversarial regime between the taxman and the taxpayer. We just inform the person that we know that you have undertaken such and such transactions and hence you should mention these while filing your income tax returns (ITRs) and also pay taxes, if applicable," he said. "We have just launched the pre-filled ITRs for certain class of taxpayers. It is aimed to ease tax compliance for taxpayers."
"We are working to make things hassle-free and work like an accountant for the taxpayer by keeping a record and presenting an automated account of their transactions," he said. The department obtains these details from third-party agencies like banks, mutual funds, credit card companies, sub-registrar and it is advised that taxpayers should re-check this information before submitting the return as there could be chances that some discrepancies creep in while furnishing of this data, he said.
In the recent budget, the government has made ITR filing mandatory for high spenders even if their taxable income is below the threshold exemption limit of Rs 5 lakh. Those mandated to file returns include people spending more than Rs 2 lakh on a foreign trip or depositing Rs 1 crore in a year in a bank account or paying the electricity bill of more than Rs 1 lakh in a year.
The CBDT chief said these measures were brought in after data analytics found high spenders were probably not filing their returns. "If someone is spending this much, should not their income be taxable? One should see the entire ecosystem around this...," he said. The aim is to create a tax compliant society where the honest taxpayer is honoured and respected and the tax evader faces the law, he said.
Mody said it is with this aim that the government and the CBDT have decided to usher in the regime of anonymised assessment where the taxpayer and the assessing officer will not meet each other and the entire tax proceeding would be conducted online. "That infrastructure for faceless assessment is already provided for. It may need some sort of an augmentation which will definitely be done," he said.

Times Now
After months of speculation pertaining to has-he-has-he-not, singer Ed Sheeran finally let the cat out of the bag. The Shape of You hitmaker has confirmed that he has tied the knot with his longtime lady love Cherry Seaborn. 
Ed dropped the big news when he unveiled his new album titled No.6 Collaborations Project. One of the songs from the album Remember The Name, the singer goes "Watch how the lyrics in this song might get twisted/My wife wears red but looks better without the lipstick."
Sharing details about the mushy lyrics in an interview, Ed shared that it was written before they got married and he was aware that the two will tie the knot by the time the song releases. 
The Perfect singer said, "It was actually before me and Cherry got married, and I knew that we'd be married by the point that the song came out."



He added, "So I said, 'Watch how the lyrics in this song might get twisted/My wife wears red but looks better without the lipstick,' And I was like 'cause someone's going to hear that and be like 'Oh they're married,' and I didn't know how that would be. But, obviously, it's already come out."
The singer also opened up about how much he loves his wife and how he still wonders as to why she's chosen him when she could be with anyone in the world. 
It was reported back in February that the couple got married in an intimate ceremony which was only attended by their closest friends and family members. 
Of their adorable social media posts, the one that is strongly etched in the public memory is one when Ed posted a photograph right in the beginning of last year. "Got myself a fiancé just before new year. We are very happy and in love, and our cats are chuffed as well," he wrote and shared a beautiful photograph.

Woman promoting porn website tries to invade World Cup final pitch
A woman promoting her son's porn website attempted to invade the pitch during England-New Zealand 2019 World Cup final at Lord's Cricket Ground on Sunday. The security guards stopped the streaker near the boundary ropes and dragged her out of the ground. Notably, her son's girlfriend had invaded the pitch during the Champions League final in June.

Not many would have expected an England-New Zealand final in this year’s Cricket World Cup but then, the game remains a great leveller. The Black Caps, who would consider themselves lucky to have made the last four despite a good start to the tournament, stunned India by 18 runs in the semi-final to make their second consecutive World Cup final. England, on the other hand, thrashed Australia by 8 wickets in the semi-final to make their first final in 27 years.
The Three Lions got to bat second in the title clash, just as they did in all their previous three outings in 1979, 1987 and 1992. Black Caps captain Kane Williamson won the toss and elected to bat and his team put up a total of 241 for 8 in 50 overs. Opener Henry Nicholls was the top scorer for the Kiwis with 55 off 77 balls while Tom Latham made 47. For the home team, spearhead Chris Woakes and Liam Plunkett took three wickets each.

Though the New Zealand batsmen hadn’t really put the game on fire, some excitement still greeted the audience present at the venue, the iconic Lord’s. A woman streaker tried to invade the pitch. She was wearing a black outfit and it had the writing ‘Vitaly Uncensored’ in white on it which is an adult website. She was barred by the security personnel standing near the fences.
The woman was later identified as Elena, the mother of Vitaly Zdorovetskiy, a known YouTuber known by the name of VitalyzdTv, who was born the year England had last made the World Cup final (1992). In May, Vitaly’s girlfriend Kinsey Wolanski, a model, had tried to cause an interruption during the Champions League final match between Liverpool and Tottenham as she tried to run onto the pitch in a bid to promote Vitaly’s adult website.
Elena is believed to be of Russian nationality and is currently based in Los Angeles, as per her Instagram post. She has a decent following on social media and the number will certainly increase following her controversial action at Lord’s on Sunday.
“My mom is crazy,” Vitaly tweeted after his mother’s act at the cricket ground.

US Congresswoman's aide criticised for Subhas Chandra Bose t-shirt
US Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's Indian-American aide Saikat Chakrabarti is being criticised for wearing a t-shirt with Subhas Chandra Bose's image printed on it. Chakrabarti had appeared in a video wearing the t-shirt in December last year, but the video went viral recently after a controversy. Notably, Bose is seen by some as "an Indian nationalist who collaborated with the Nazis".

ANI
Washington DC [USA], July 14 (ANI): The aide of a US Congresswoman is facing backlash from Republican supporters and right-wing media of the country after a video of him wearing a t-shirt with an image of Subhash Chandra Bose emblazoned on it went viral.In December, last year, Indian-American Saikat Chakrabarti, the chief of staff to Democrat Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, appeared in a video by NowThis News where he talked about Cortez's surprise congressional victory. Not the content of the video, but the green t-shirt worn by Chakrabarti triggered a controversy leading to resurfacing of the video almost eight months later.What led to the uproar is that by some Bose is perceived as "an Indian nationalist who collaborated with the Nazis", as pointed out in a report by Jewish Telegraphic Agency. The report further describes Bose as a dissenting Indian nationalist who enlisted "tens of thousands of Indian men to support the Japanese Invasion of British India in 1944 and help fight the British in Europe for Hitler."Similar views were echoed in a report by Newsweek headlined, "Who was Subhas Chandra Bose? Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez senior staffer criticised for sporting image of Nazi collaborator."Chakrabarti's T-shirt is not the sole reason he has found himself at the centre of Amerian politics of late. As pointed out in a report by The New York Times, the Indian-American ignited a firestorm two weeks ago after calling moderate Democrats who advocated for the USD 4.59 billion emergency border funding bill in late June, as "new Southern Democrats".In a now-deleted tweet, Chakrabarti wrote that the "New Southern Democrats... certainly seem hell-bent to do to black and brown people today what the old Southern Democrats did in the 40s."In the following tweet, Chakrabarti cleared that he didn't think "people have to be personally racist to enable a racist system. And the same could even be said of the Southern Democrats. I don't believe Sharice is a racist person, but her votes are showing her to enable a racist system" (ANI)

French Prez booed, told to step down ahead of Bastille Day parade
French President Emmanuel Macron was booed by protestors who demanded his resignation as he arrived at the annual Bastille Day parade in Paris on Sunday. This comes just one day after the 'yellow vest' protestors took to the streets, marking the 35th consecutive week of the nationwide protest against the Macron-led government's policies.

Numerous people started to vent their anger at Macron moments before his motorcade – accompanied by the French horse guards – showed up at the Champs Elysees avenue on Sunday afternoon. Ruptly agency filmed people booing and chanting ‘Macron, step down!’ in French.
Some were seen waving France’s national flag as the President and his entourage headed down the street to review participating troops. The protesters were encircled – though were not confronted – by dozens of police officers wearing riot gear.
At some point, however, the situation became more tense, with police using pepper spray during small scuffles in downtown Paris. It is unclear how many ‘Yellow Vests’ were present as they had been urged not to wear their iconic high-visibility jackets on this national day. 
It has been reported that protest leaders, Eric Drouet, Maxime Nicolle and Jerome Rodrigues, were apprehended by police at the main military parade route, the Champs Elysees avenue.
It comes just one day after the ‘Yellow Vests” took to the streets again on Saturday, marking the 35th consecutive week of the nationwide protest against the Macron government’s policies. Simultaneously, leaders of the protest movement urged followers to take part in the rally on Bastille Day.

Ashwin picks 6-for against Surrey in County C'ship match
Indian spinner Ravichandran Ashwin, playing for Nottinghamshire, picked up a six-wicket haul against Surrey in the County Championship. Ashwin's performance helped Nottinghamshire dismiss Surrey for 240 on the first day. Nottinghamshire subsequently ended the day's play at 20/1. The second-best figures behind Ashwin's 6/69 were Liam Patterson-White's 3/62.

Nottinghamshire vs Surrey: India off-spinner Ravichandran Ashwin came to the party with the ball at Trent Bridge as he scalped six wickets to bundle out Surrey for 240 runs. The offie finished with figures of 6-69 off 33 overs. Ashwin was looking on top of his game as he was confident to try what he wanted and on most occasions it paid off.
After electing to bat first, the visitors lost Ryan Patel early after a slow start. Ashwin sent both the openers packing as he also got Rory Burns.
Here are videos of Ashwin’s wickets at Trent Bridge in the County match:



Despite being a regular in the Indian test squad, Ashwin has been overlooked for the limited overs selection for quite some time now. After the final of ICC Champions Trophy in 2017, the off-spinner has not been seen in the coloured jersey for the Indian team. As the Indian team went for the World Cup, Ashwin decided to ply his trade in County Cricket and joined Nottinghamshire, where he is expected to play six of the last seven matches of the season. With his figure of 6/69, the bowler has now taken his wicket tally to 17 in just three matches.
Also, the is second County stint for the offie after playing for Worcestershire in 2017 season. His test teammates Ajinkya Rahaneand Cheteshwar Pujara are also their playing in England’s domestic format. Apparently, Rahane scored a century for Hampshire on his county debut.

Vijay Shankar to undergo fitness tests at NCA for injured toe
All-rounder Vijay Shankar is set to undergo tests at National Cricket Academy (NCA) in Bengaluru to determine the extent of his toe injury which he suffered during 2019 World Cup. Shankar was hit by a yorker from Jasprit Bumrah during practice. Shankar scored 58 runs and took two wickets in the 2019 World Cup before being replaced by Mayank Agarwal.

Times Now
Indian all-rounder Vijay Shankar will undergo tests at the National Cricket Academy (NCA) in Bengaluru to determine the extent of his toe injury which he suffered during India's World Cup campaign. Shankar's World Cup campaign came to an end due to the injury as he was replaced by batsman Mayank Agarwal in the later stages of the tournament.
Shankar picked up an injury after being hit by a yorker from teammate Jasprit Bumrah while batting in the nets. He was ruled out of the showpiece event ahead of the knockout stages with Rishabh Pant taking the number 4 spot in his absence. Shankar didn't have an impressive World Cup campaign managing to score only 58 runs in three games while picking up a couple of wickets. 
He was picked over experienced Ambati Rayudu as the designated no.4 in the Indian batting line-up with the selectors also praising his three-dimensional abilities. However, Vijay didn't manage to make an impact in the tournament. KL Rahul was played at the no.4 spot ahead of him before Shikhar Dhawan's injury forced the right-hander to take the opening spot allowing Shankar to be included in the playing XI.
He managed to play on three games before being replaced by Pant at no.4 and was subsequently ruled of the tournament. Agarwal, who was called in as a replacement, didn't get any game. India finished the league stages on top of the table with 15 points from nine games. The Men in Blue's solitary defeat in the league stage came against eventual finalists England.
Meanwhile, their clash against New Zealand was washed out due to rain. India met the Black Caps in the semi-final and headed into the must-win clash as the overwhelming favourites but were stunned by the Kiwis, who came out on top in a hard-fought game. India failed to chase down a modest target of 240 runs to suffer an 18-run defeat and bow out of the tournament.
Kiwi pacers Trent Boult and Matt Henry ran riot against the Indian batting line-up. The top-order suffered a massive collapse leaving the middle-order with a mountain to climb. Despite half-centuries from Ravindra Jadeja and MS Dhoni, India fell short in the run chase.
Shankar is in contention to be included in the ODI side for the upcoming series against West Indies but it will be interesting to see if he will continue to be India's no.4.

Students forced to go home for toilet in UP school with no building
Students of a government primary school in Uttar Pradesh's Shahjahanpur study in the open and reportedly go home to use the toilet or to drink water due to lack of infrastructure. "There is no space for cooking mid-day meal...the food is cooked at another school and...brought here," a teacher said. The school remains closed when it rains, the teacher added.
https://www.timesnownews.com/mirror-now/civic-issues/article/no-washroom-water-or-roof-ups-government-school-bereft-of-basic-infrastructure/453634?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts
Times Now
Shahjahanpur: Another infrastructural shortfall has come to the fore from a government school in Uttar Pradesh's Shahjahanpur. Pictures of students studying without a roof on their heads have surfaced on social media. Without desks and chairs, the students continue to study in the school even as the administration fails them.
The incident raises serious questions on the administration of the state. Pictures of the students attending classes in a rundown building have brought the education sector under scrutiny.



Megha Agarwal, a teacher at the school said, "Students go to their homes if they are thirsty or need to go to the toilet as there is no facility here. School is closed whenever it rains. There is no space for cooking mid-day meal, hence the food is cooked at another school and is brought here for students."
Government schools are meant for children who do not have adequate financial backing and are underprivileged. Mid-day meals, infrastructure and educational facilities are the three most important aspects of a government school. Schools in the country, however, seem to be struggling in all these aspects. 
Shahjahanpur BSA, Rakesh Kumar said," There were some government schools which were run in rented accommodation. Many of these accommodations have now become depleted or have become non-existent now. Wherever there is a possibility, we are merging such schools with other schools within one kilometre. At places where there is no nearby alternative, we will be demanding for places and funds to construct a building."
The students of a government school in Dewas, Madhya Pradesh were seen studying under a makeshift tent in June. The students were forced to study under the tent as the school did not have proper infrastructure. 
The school that had been under construction for the past 12 years did not have a roof. Locals alleged that the village sarpanch had not released funds allocated by the state government for the construction of the school. 
With the strength of 59 students, the school only had two permanent teachers and one guest teacher. The locals also alleged that even after repeated complaints, the Education Minister Deepak Joshi did not take any steps to end their woes. 
Collector Shrikant Pandey acknowledged the incident and said, "If there is any inconvenience being faced by students of government school, an immediate inquiry will be done and steps will be taken accordingly."

In a letter written to Modi, Swadeshi Jagran Manch (SJM) co-convener Ashwani Mahajan highlighted the organisation's concerns over the two platforms, which he alleged were exposing India's youth to being influenced by "vested interests".
"In recent weeks, TikTok has become a hub for anti-national content that is being shared extensively on the application and which can rupture the fabric of our society," Mahajan said.
Talking about Helo, the SJM leader alleged that the app was found paying Rs 7 crore for over 11,000 morphed political ads on other social media platforms.
"Some of these ads were using morphed pictures of senior Indian political leaders. Functionaries of the BJP themselves wrote to the EC during the last general election raising these concerns," he said.
Mahajan demanded that the Ministry of Home Affairs ban all the Chinese apps, including TikTok and Helo, in the country.
"As some segments of the Chinese establishment have negative intentions with regard to the sovereignty and integrity of India," he said.
The SJM co-convener claimed that the combination of apps like TikTok and interventions by Chinese government can be used to gain access to the private lives of Indian citizens and "create social turmoil in our country".
Mahajan expressed concern that India currently did not have any regulations to monitor the applications provided on Play Store in Android mobile phones and App Store in iPhones.
He requested the government to being a new law that requires testing and regulation of such apps to "protect our national security" as well as the privacy of citizens.

J&J faces probe on denial of carcinogen in baby talc: Report
The US Justice Department is now reportedly pursuing a criminal investigation into whether Johnson & Johnson (J&J) lied to public about cancer risks related to its 'Baby Powder'. Reports said a grand jury was examining documents about what J&J knew regarding any carcinogens in its products. A J&J spokesperson denied the new development, adding, "[It] doesn't contain asbestos...or cause cancer."

The US Justice Department is pursuing a criminal investigation into whether Johnson & Johnson lied to the public about the possible cancer risks of its talcum powder, people with knowledge of the matter said.
The criminal probe, which hasn’t been reported previously, coincides with a regulatory investigation and civil claims by thousands of cancer patients that J&J’s Baby Powder talc was responsible for their illness. Now, a grand jury in Washington is examining documents related to what company officials knew about any carcinogens in their products, the people said.
Baby Powder accounts for only a tiny fraction of J&J’s annual revenue, but it’s been a core brand for the company for more than a century. Questions about the product’s safety have led to more than 14,000 lawsuits from consumers asserting that the company’s talc products caused their ovarian cancer or mesothelioma, a rare form of the disease linked to asbestos exposure.
J&J disclosed in February that it had received subpoenas, but little was known then about the investigation behind them, including whether the matter was civil or criminal. The filing didn’t mention a grand jury.
The company said in a statement Friday that there had been no new developments. “We have been fully cooperating with the previously disclosed DOJ investigation and will continue to do so," said J&J spokeswoman Kim Montagnino. “Johnson’s Baby Powder does not contain asbestos or cause cancer, as supported by decades of independent clinical evidence."
The Justice Department didn’t respond to requests for comment.
Shares of J&J declined by 4.2% to close at $134.30.
J&J, the world’s largest maker of health care products, has said safety tests of its Baby Powder over many decades have shown no presence of asbestos. But some of the lawsuits have turned up internal memos as far back as the 1960s and ’70s that contain warnings from company scientists that asbestos detected in J&J’s talc was a “severe health hazard" that could pose a legal risk for the company.
Justice Department prosecutors, FBI agents and Securities and Exchange Commission regulators are almost surely looking at whether J&J officials’ public denials that their talc-based products ever contained asbestos were truthful, legal experts said. SEC spokeswoman Judy Burns declined to comment.
Nearly a dozen juries have concluded J&J knew that some of their Baby Powder and former Shower-to-Shower products had at least trace amounts of asbestos and failed to disclose that to consumers. Over the past three years, jurors have awarded a total of more than $5 billion to people who blame the powders for their cancers.
The company has said it has set aside money for legal costs related to talc claims but hasn’t said how much. Bloomberg Intelligence estimates that civil settlements could cost J&J as much as $15 billion overall. J&J says it has no liability because the products are safe.
Shares of J&J plunged as much as 17% in December -- erasing billions in value -- after news reports about memos appearing to show that J&J executives knew the products were contaminated with asbestos as early as the 1970s.
The February document requests from the Justice Department, the SEC and the top Democrat on the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions sought information about the company’s knowledge of asbestos in its talc-based products. J&J said it would be “cooperating with these government inquiries and will be producing documents in response."
The grand jury was impaneled after the Justice Department’s fraud unit started an investigation. Investigators are probably looking for more internal communications that might conflict with the company’s public statements, said Henry Klingeman, a former federal prosecutor now in private practice in New Jersey.
“Since J&J is a public company, they are probably looking at whether their statements amounted to fraudulent statements to consumers and regulators," Klingeman said in an interview. “I’d also think they’d be looking at whether they violated securities-fraud laws."
The grand jury inquiry is likely to influence any talks between J&J and plaintiffs over resolving their claims out of court, said Peter Henning, a law professor at Wayne State University in Detroit.
“This will make it more difficult for Johnson & Johnson to settle the civil cases as long as there is a continuing criminal investigation, which may require employees to testify before a federal grand jury," Henning said. “Civil plaintiffs may not want to settle until they know better whether criminal charges will be filed, which they can use to aid their cases."
In addition to the consumers’ suits, some J&J investors have accused the company of defrauding them, arguing in lawsuits that J&J failed to disclose that its powder was tainted and that the company’s shares were artificially inflated as a result.
Jacob Frenkel, a former SEC trial lawyer now in private practice in Washington, said there’s no timeline for grand-jury investigations and no certainty it will result in charges. “This could be a high-profile government investigation that goes nowhere," he said. “Regardless of the outcome, the timetable for such investigations can measure in years, not months," he added.
Baby powder is mostly talc, a mineral used to keep skin dry and as an astringent to prevent diaper rash. It’s also used in consumer products such as makeup, paint and dietary supplements. But geological formations that contain talc also yield asbestos, a mineral once used in products such as building insulation.
Scientists have found strong links between asbestos and mesothelioma, while plaintiffs’ lawyers claim that studies have also shown a link between talc and ovarian cancer. In court filings, J&J has disputed both contentions.
J&J sold the rights to its Shower-to-Shower talcum powder to Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc. in 2012. Valeant, which changed its name to Bausch Health Cos last year, has an indemnity agreement with J&J covering asbestos suits tied to the powder.
Juries in states such as Missouri, California and New Jersey have ruled for some of the plaintiffs since suits started going to trial in 2016. However, some of those verdicts have been thrown out by judges and others are on appeal. Some other cases have resulted in hung juries or outright wins for J&J.
Most of the ovarian cancer cases, along with investors’ suits, have been consolidated before a federal judge in New Jersey for pretrial information exchanges and test trials. The first trials of those cases haven’t yet been set.

Why would I watch the film again: 'Arjun Reddy' actor on 'Kabir Singh'
'Arjun Reddy' actor Vijay Deverakonda, when asked if he has seen the film's remake 'Kabir Singh' starring Shahid Kapoor, said, "I know the story, I have done that film, why will I watch again?" "Shahid has done that film, and he has gone through the character, and there is nothing for me to watch again," he added.

Hindustan Times
Actor Vijay Deverakonda, who shot to fame after an acclaimed performance in Telugu hit Arjun Reddy, has said that he has no interest in watching the film’s remake, Kabir Singh. The central role of an alcoholic, abusive medical student has been played by actor Shahid Kapoor in the Hindi film, also directed by the original’s Sandeep Reddy Vanga.
Speaking at a press interaction for his upcoming film Dear Comrade, Deverakonda was asked if he’s seen Kabir Singh, to which he replied, according to Cinema Express, “Shahid has done that film, and he has gone through the character, and there is nothing for me to watch it again. I know the story, I have done that film, why will I watch again?”
Kabir Singh has become the highest-grossing Bollywood film of the year, making over Rs 250 crore at the domestic box office, exceeding the industry’s expectations. Arjun Reddy was also a box office hit. Both films have been criticised - Kabir Singh more than Arjun Reddy - for glorifying toxic masculinity. Both Vanga and Shahid have repeatedly denied the claims. 
Also read: Kabir Singh director Sandeep Reddy Vanga savaged on Twitter for controversial comments: ‘What an arrogant, sexist man’
A recent interview with Anupama Chopra in which Vanga seemed to condone violence in the name of love was harshly criticised on the internet. He later told Deccan Chronicle in an interview, “I had to say what I had to say. And then they cut out portions of my comments.”

Deverakonda added that Vanga has been asking him to watch the film, but he won’t budge from his decision. He said, “I wanted the Hindi film to be a big hit, because Sandeep is my man. But unexpectedly, it became a blockbuster. Done. No more discussion there.”
Kabir Singh has defied negative reviews, a non-holiday release date and several other obstacles to become a blockbuster. The film now faces competition from Hrithik Roshan’s Super 30, which has made Rs 30 crore in two days of release.

Noida: A 20-year-old law student was found dead at his home in Shastri Nagar.
The deceased, named Vipin Verma, has left behind a video in which he alleged that he was harassed by his friends and that provoked him to end his life.
The police registered a case after the student’s father, who is a police head constable, filed a complaint.
According to the complaint, the student had informed his mother about the harassment. But she asked him to divert his focus to studies instead. The mother also brought the matter into father’s notice who then called the accused and warned them not to disturb his son, the police said.
Vipin was a 3rd-year law student at a private college in Ghaziabad.
A case under Section 306 (abetment of suicide) of the Indian Penal Code has been registered.
As of now, no arrests have been made in the case.
“We have called all the four suspects for questioning and have not arrested anyone so far.

The statements of the other three suspects will also be recorded,” Hindustan Times reported Shlok Kumar, superintendent of police (city) as saying.
A probe has been launched into the matter.

Trump is an illegitimate President: Ex-US President Jimmy Carter
Former US President Jimmy Carter has said US President Donald Trump is an "illegitimate" President. "If fully investigated, it'd show that Trump didn't actually win the election in 2016. He lost the election and he was put in office because the Russians interfered...on his behalf," he added. Trump should condemn the meddling by Russia in the elections, he further said.
