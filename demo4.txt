NIA (Amendment) Bill passed in Rajya Sabha amid doubts by Opposition
The Rajya Sabha has passed the National Investigation Agency (Amendment) Bill, 2019. Although the bill was passed unanimously, the Opposition raised doubts over its possible misuse. Union Home Minister Amit Shah said, "I assure the House that the bill will not be misused...Both Houses need to prove to the world and the terrorists that we are united in this fight."

New Delhi: In a big push for India’s national security, the Rajya Sabha, on Wednesday, passed the controversial National Investigation Agency (Amendment) Bill 2019 unanimously, with a united show of strength from the Upper House.
The bill’s uncontested passage in the Upper House is a marked diversion from its discussion in the Lok Sabha on Monday, when the Centre and the Opposition sparred over the validity of the proposed amendments in the bill and its ability to rein in terror. Eventually, there were six voices of dissent in the Lok Sabha, as opposed to none in the Rajya Sabha.
While the Opposition parties raised doubts over the possible misuse of the Bill, speaking in the Upper House, Union home minister Amit Shah said, “I assure the House that the Bill will not be misused under any circumstances. If the country does not vouch for the efficiency of the NIA, how will it hold any standing globally? Both Houses need to prove to the world and the terrorists that we are united in this fight."
Shah added that the proposed amendments would further empower the country to fight terror – as was evident in the fact that out of the 195 cases with the agency since 2014, 129 had been chargesheeted, with 41 convictions.
Minister of state for home affairs, G. Kishen Reddy told the house that from the NIA's inception in 2009 to 2014, the agency had registered 80 cases, out of which judgment was passed in 38 cases and 36 of which saw convictions. Reddy however, added that since Prime Minister Narendra Modi had assumed office in 2014, the agency had registered 195 cases – a huge jump from the United Progressive Alliance (UPA) government’s numbers.
The Congress party, while reaffirming its stand for strengthening national security, pointed out lacunae in the proposed amendments, reiterating that of the major cases -- such as the Samjhauta Express blast, Ajmer Dargah bombing, the Malegaon blast and the Sohrabuddin encounter case – none had reached a conclusive end.
“Section 4 of the amendment adds that the agency wants to go abroad and conduct investigations as they do in India. First of all, they don’t have the treatise to catch any person abroad without going through the local police force. Have you heard of that happening in India? So in practical effect they will have zero power, but they will show India that they have done something great," said senior Congress party leader and Member of Parliament (MP) Abhishek Manu Singhvi.
The bill now awaits President Ramnath Kovind’s nod before it is deemed an act.
The NIA was set up in 2009 following the 26/11 Mumbai terror attacks which killed 166 people, with the Pakistan-based Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) claiming responsibility.
On Monday, the Lok Sabha passed the Bill with the opposition red flagging concerns of the bill being misused against certain communities.
The bill was passed after 278 members of Parliament (MPs) supported it, and six opposing it during voting.
The Bill proposes three major amendments to the NIA bill of 2008. The first amendment focuses on providing the NIA with more teeth to investigate cases pertaining to human trafficking, counterfeit currency or bank notes, manufacture or sale of prohibited arms, cyber-terrorism, and offences under the Explosive Substances Act, 1908.
At the same time, the Bill also seeks to expand the agency’s jurisdiction to investigate scheduled offences committed outside India, such as the Easter day bombings in Sri Lanka.
Finally, the bill also proposes to allow the Central government to constitute special courts for NIA trials for the trial of scheduled offences.
As of now, the NIA is designated to probe cases of terrorism within the country. Once the amendments are cleared by both Houses of Parliament, it will allow the NIA to probe cases of cybercrime and human trafficking as well, as per the proposed amendments.
The amendment is significant as the agency has been closely tracking the development of Islamic State (IS) modules in the country, especially in the wake of the Easter Day bombings in Sri Lanka.

Tata India's most valued brand at $19.6 bn, LIC next at $7.3 bn
The brand 'Tata' has again been ranked as India's most valuable brand in 2019, according to a report by London-based consultancy Brand Finance. Tata's brand value rose 37% from last year to $19.6 billion, surpassing the combined value of the second and third most valued brands in India, LIC ($7.3 billion) and Infosys ($6.5 billion), respectively.
https://www.livemint.com/companies/news/tata-pips-lic-to-become-india-s-most-valuable-brand-in-2019-1563355922166.html?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts
Livemint
The brand "Tata" has become India’s most valuable brand for the second straight year in 2019, according to the Brand Finance India 100 2019 report.
Tata’s brand value rose 37% to $19.6 billion as compared to $14.2 billion in 2018, surpassing the combined value of the second and third most valued brands in India. The second most valued brand this year was the government-owned Life Insurance Corporation of India (LIC) at $7.3 billion and a close third was Infosys at $6.5 billion.
“Being recognised as India’s most valuable and fastest growing brand is a matter of pride for us," said Harish Bhat, brand custodian at Tata Sons.
“This is testament to the Tata brand’s strong inherent value, reflecting the trust consumers and stakeholders have placed in us. As we move ahead, our people-first approach, industry leading technologies, expertise and strategic investments will further strengthen our brand," he added.
The annual report on Indian brands was published by a London-based independent branded business valuation and strategy consultant, Brand Finance. The firm calculates the value of brands in its league tables using the ‘royalty relief approach’, which estimates likely future sales that are attributable to a brand based on the royalty rate that would be charged for its use.
The royalty rate is calculated by the firm and then used to arrive at a ‘brand value’ that is equivalent to the net economic benefit that a licensor would derive by licensing the brand in the open market.
“Tata Group is to be commended for its ability to scale new heights, as it is not only India’s most valuable brand, but has also recorded faster growth than any other brand in the top 25, with an impressive 37% increase," said David Haigh, chief executive officer of Brand Finance.
“The group’s brand presence across autos, IT services, steel and chemicals continues to go from strength to strength and remains a force to be reckoned with," he added.
Every year, Brand Finance values 5,000 of the world’s biggest brands. The 100 most valuable Indian brands are included in the ‘Brand Finance India 100 2019’ ranking.
The report also ranks brands based on their strength, which is understood as the efficacy of a brand’s performance on intangible measures relative to its competitors. This year, Mukesh Ambani-owned Reliance Jio emerged as the "strongest" Indian brand, followed by HDFC Bank and Indian Oil Corporation Ltd.

BELAGAVI: After consuming the midday meal at school, 81 students of Government Higher Primary School of Vantamuri, near Belagavi, were rushed to the district hospital with complaints of health problems on Tuesday afternoon.
According to sources, a dead lizard was found in a container used to cook the meal for children, and all of them started complaining of health issues after having their meal.
A Belagavi-based NGO supplies midday meals to the government school in Vantamuri. The food was served on Tuesday during the lunch break.
A teacher found a dead lizard in the rice container in the kitchen and immediately asked students to stop eating. By that time, a large number of students had already eaten most of their meal.
Panicked students and teachers took the help of villagers to rush all the students to the primary health centre in Vantamuri, and from there, they were brought to the district hospital.
After treatment, 69 students were discharged without any complications, while 12 others who had consumed more food, have been kept under observation for a day in the hospital.
On receiving the information, Belagavi Tahsildar Manjula Naik, DDPI A B Pundalik, district health officer Dr S V Munyal, rural block education officer Leelawati Hiremath, rural ACP Balachandra Shingyagol and other officers visited the district hospital. 
Parents demand action against NGO 
The parents of the affected students expressed anger over the incident and demanded action against the NGO which failed to take measures to ensure supply of hygienic food to the children.
Speaking to reporters, DHO Dr S V Munyal said the students were paranoid after the commotion broke out in the village.
They are all stable without any health problems, he said. The food samples have been sent to the laboratory for testing, he said.  
Belagavi rural block education officer Leelavati Hiremath said, “Midday meals are supplied to this school by an NGO.
A lizard was found in the rice while distributing meals to students, and the staff stopped distributing and brought the students to the district hospital in an ambulance.
Now all students are out of danger. A report will be sent to higher officials to take action against the guilty, she added.

According to a media report, Reddy further said that the Board would not wait for the High Court verdict on the PIL filed against VIP darshans adding that he had already told the EO and JEO to stop the list darshans. He further claimed that the situation is such that people have approached the court against the VIP darshan.
Reddy also said that he would ensure that devotees get to pay obeisance to the deity every day.



The construction of Venkateswara temple started in 300 AD and has been constructed in Dravidian architecture. One of the richest temples in the world in terms of donations received and the overall accumulated wealth around 50,000 to 100,000 pilgrims visit the temple daily.
The temple has an annual income of Rs 3,000 crore and during festivals, the number of visitors goes up to one lakh.
"Our priority is providing hassle-free darshan to devotees and ensure permanent measures that Tirumala is free from water scarcity," Subba Reddy had said after his appointment.
YV Subba Reddy is the uncle of Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy. Reddy, who is a senior leader of the ruling YSR Congress Party (YSRCP), is the 50th Chairman of TTD Trust Board, which is entrusted with managing daily affairs of the temple.
Recently, TTD officials said that the temple is sitting on pure gold reserves of over 9,000 kg.
The board has 7,235 kg of the precious metal deposited with two nationalized banks under different gold deposit schemes.
The board holds 1,934 kg gold in its treasury, including 1,381 kg which it got back from Punjab National Bank following the end of a three-year term of a gold deposit scheme.
The board is expecting to earn total revenue of about Rs 3,116 crore including Rs 1,231 crore from offerings and Rs 846 crore from interest on deposits in nationalized and private banks during 2019-20.

In a recent interview with a tabloid, Rishi Kapoor poured his heart out about battling the devastating disease and the struggles he had to go through in the last one year. Incidentally, in the beginning, the veteran actor had lost 26 kg of his weight because he didn’t have an appetite and couldn’t eat anything. However, Rishi has confirmed that the phase is more or less over, emphasising that he has gained 8 kg since his recovery.
“On the subject of my health, thanks to the prayers and good wishes of my family, friends and fans, I am perfect now. The cancer is in remission, but I am still under treatment. I have a crucial meeting with the doctors today at 10.45 am, there’s one treatment still left to be done. The problem is not the treatment but the reaction time. The problem is not the treatment but the reaction time. There is a six-week gap between one treatment and the next when all you can do is eat, shop, watch movies, live a normal life which I would rather do at home than here in New York. It’s been nine months and 16 days—I know since I have been counting the days—that I have been away. I really miss home,” Rishi Kapoor revealed.









 
While Rishi Kapoor didn’t want to indulge in describing the disease he battled for close to a year, the veteran actor did reveal details about his post-cancer treatment. Rishi discussed the process underway and the timeline of his treatment following which he will return home at the end of next month.
“I have to be here for 11 months, so I will not be back before the end of August. It’s been a difficult time, very taxing, but Neetu (wife), and my children (Ranbir and Riddhima) have been very supportive. I am grateful to everyone. I am waiting to come back and raring to get going. I will plan my return five-six weeks after my last treatment. It is called consolidation or pushback, whereby I will have to undergo chemotherapy to ensure that the ailment does not return. This is the second time I am going through the treatment. I am hoping that I can plan an end-August return but all this talk that I will be back in early September for my birthday, is again nothing but speculation.” – excerpt from the interview.
