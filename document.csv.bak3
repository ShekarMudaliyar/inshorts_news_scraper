It doesn't make Selection Committee biased.""",CricTracker,"Ambati Rayudu even without featuring in the Indian team that played the World Cup 2019 has made more news than most other players. When he was not included in the primary squad but named as a back-up he put out the famous 3D tweet. Later when the selectors had to name replacement players, Rayudu was still not included and it was said that the reason could’ve been his tweet. However, selector MSK Prasad disagrees.When Prasad announced the India squads for West Indies tour, he was asked about Rayudu who retired from all forms of the sport after the snubs. He clarified that the selection committee was only making replacement changes based on the team management’s requirements and on that basis he didn’t find a place. There was no sort of bias in the decision-making and that they too got emotional as Rayudu retired.AdvertisementThe chairman of selectors also mentioned that they had brought Rayudu in the ODI team based on his T20I performance amidst criticism and gave him enough opportunities to cement a spot. Moving forward based on his performance and the combination of the team he couldn’t be included in the World Cup squad.They persisted with him even after the middle-order batsman failed the yo-yo test. He was put on a fitness program at the NCA and they made sure he cleared it at the next go to be a part of the Indian team.“There was criticism when we picked Rayudu after his 2017-18 T20 form. When he failed the fitness test, we backed him. Due to some combinations and permutations, we didn’t pick him for the World Cup. We didn’t do anything against him,” MSK said.Rayudu’s 3D tweet got really popular and also proved to be meme material. The common perception was that the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) officials, the team management as well as the selectors were not happy with his tweet. The Hyderabadi was one of the few Indian players who ever questioned their selection or non-selection on social media or a public platform.However, Prasad said that he saw humour in the tweet and really enjoyed the sarcasm in it since it was timely.“Ambati Rayudu tweet was lovely.

54,Umpire who gave England 6 overthrows in WC final admits it was a mistake,"Umpire Kumar Dharmasena has admitted that awarding England six overthrows instead of five in final over of 2019 World Cup final was a mistake. ""I agree...there was a judgmental error when I see it on TV replays now. But we didn't have luxury of TV replays at the ground,"" he said. He further said that he'll never regret the decision.",CricTracker,"It’s been a week since the 2019 World Cup final has finished but many are still busy discussing the game. Undoubtedly, it was the best ODI game ever played and irrespective of the result, both England and New Zealand should be proud of themselves for the effort they put in. But some crunch moments decided the game eventually and one of them was the umpire Kumar Dharmasena awarding six runs to England in the last over of the chase when the ball ricocheted off Ben Stokes’ bat.The incident took place in the final over when the home team needed nine runs off three balls and the Kiwis almost had the World Cup trophy in the bag. The batsman swatted the ball to deep mid-wicket and set off for two runs. While taking the second run, Stokes dived to avoid getting run-out only for his bat to deflect the ball to the boundary.AdvertisementThe on-field umpires consulted then to give England six runs when actually five runs should’ve signalled. According to the cricketing laws, the two batsmen should’ve crossed each other when the fielder threw the ball and Stokes and Adil Rashid hadn’t crossed when Martin Guptill fired in a throw. It was considered as a clear mistake by the former international umpire Simon Taufel.Speaking about the controversial call to a Sri Lankan publication the Sunday Times, Kumar Dharmasena has cleared that he has no regrets about the decision he made regarding the overthrow. However, he also admitted that they made a judgemental error in the middle.“It’s easy for people to comment after seeing TV replays. I agree that there was a judgmental error when I see it on TV replays now. But we did not have the luxury of TV replays at the ground and I will never regret the decision I made. Besides, the ICC praised me for the decision I made at that time,” he said.Dharmasena also cleared that he communicated to the leg umpire Marais Erasmus before making the decision and even the other umpires agreed to give six runs to England. “There is no provision in the law to refer this to the third umpire as no dismissal was involved. So, I did consult the leg umpire through the communication system which is heard by all other umpires and the match referee.“And, while they cannot check TV replays, they all confirmed that the batsmen have completed the run. This is when I made my decision,” the 48-year-old added.",https://www.crictracker.com/i-will-never-regret-the-decision-i-made-says-kumar-dharmasena-on-the-controversial-overthrow-in-the-world-cup-final/
59,British finance minister says he will resign if Boris becomes PM,"British finance minister Philip Hammond has said he will resign from the post if Boris Johnson becomes Prime Minister. ""Assuming that Boris Johnson becomes Prime Minister, I understand that his conditions for serving in his government would include accepting a no-deal Brexit on the 31st of October. That is not something I could ever sign up to,"" Hammond added.",Reuters,"LONDON (Reuters) - British finance minister Philip Hammond said on Sunday he would resign if Boris Johnson became prime minister because he felt unable to support a leader happy to take the country out of the European Union without a deal. Hammond’s decision underlines the strength of feeling in parliament against a no-deal Brexit, which some lawmakers and many businesses say would be catastrophic for the economy. A loyal Conservative who has served in a number of ministerial roles, Hammond is an unlikely rebel. He said his fears over a no deal forced him to vote against the government for the first time in his 22-year political career last week. Britain’s new prime minister is tipped to be former London mayor Johnson, who has promised to leave the EU “do or die” by an Oct. 31 deadline. That leaves him facing a tricky Brexit challenge from the moment he would take office on Wednesday. Johnson has said he would ramp up preparations for a no deal to try to force the EU’s negotiators to make changes to the agreement that Prime Minister Theresa May sealed with Brussels and UK lawmakers voted down three times.  But parliamentary opposition to a no deal is growing and the EU is refusing to budge over that withdrawal agreement. “I am sure I am not going to be sacked because I am going to resign before we get to that point,” Hammond told the BBC’s Andrew Marr Show, adding he would resign to May before she tendered her own resignation to the Queen on Wednesday. “Assuming that Boris Johnson becomes prime minister, I understand that his conditions for serving in his government would include accepting a no-deal (EU) exit on the 31st of October. That is not something I could ever sign up to.” Johnson has said his most senior ministers “would have to be reconciled” with the possibility of a no-deal Brexit on Oct. 31, a departure he does not want to see happen, but one he says must be planned for to try to increase pressure on the EU. That stance means several more ministers who want to leave with a deal may seek to quit before facing the prospect of being sacked by Johnson. Justice minister David Gauke has indicated he will also step down on Wednesday, and some lawmakers say they expect more pro-EU Conservatives to leave their positions to hold talks in parliament to find a way to prevent a no deal. Keir Starmer, Brexit policy chief in the main opposition Labour Party, said on Twitter he respected Hammond’s decision. “I want to work with all those MPs (members of parliament) who, like me, want to ensure parliament can stop a disastrous no-deal exit,” Starmer said. Hammond’s intention to resign led Ian Blackford, the Westminster leader of the Scottish National Party, to predict that Johnson could become “the shortest serving prime minister in history”. Hammond, who according to sources close to Johnson often infuriated the former mayor who felt the finance minister was “talking Britain down”, said he did not believe his former colleague could win a deal with the EU by the deadline.  He instead advised the new prime minister to ask the EU for a little longer if there were signs that the two sides could agree on a compromise position - something Johnson’s rival for the premiership, Jeremy Hunt, has said he is open to. But the EU has so far been steadfast in its view that it cannot open the withdrawal agreement, and Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney said both sides would be “in trouble” if the new prime minister was intent on tearing up the deal. He suggested the new leader could secure changes to the political declaration on future ties to get rid of the Northern Irish backstop - an insurance policy to avoid the return of a hard border between the British province and Ireland. “We hope that the backstop that many in the UK don’t seem to like can be avoided,” Coveney told the BBC. “(But) we are simply not going to move away from that withdrawal agreement.” Johnson and his supporters say the hardline stance is little more than a negotiating ploy. But if the standoff failed to be broken and a no deal Brexit was in the offing, Hammond would become a high-profile backer of attempts in parliament to stop a no deal. “Yes, (I will campaign) to stop no deal happening on Oct. 31 without the consent of parliament,” Hammond said. “I want to be a loyal supporter of the next Conservative government and if (it).. can deliver a negotiated Brexit deal that protects our economy then I will strongly support that government. And I hope I will be able to.” Reporting by Elizabeth Piper; editing by John Stonestreet",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-britain-eu-hammond/uk-finance-minister-hammond-to-resign-on-wednesday-over-no-deal-brexit-idUSKCN1UG0B4?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

75,Agencies gave IL&FS good ratings despite stress flags: Audit,"A Grant Thornton audit into debt-laden IL&FS Group revealed that rating agencies despite flagging financial stress before its default, continued to give it and its units ""consistently high"" credit ratings. It said officials of agencies, comprising ICRA, CRISIL, CARE, Brickwork and India Ratings, were possibly given gifts like smartwatches and overseas sports event tickets to influence the ratings.",Reuters,"MUMBAI/NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Credit rating agencies for years assigned high ratings to India’s Infrastructure Leasing & Financial Services (IL&FS) and its group companies despite its deteriorating finances, according to a special audit. Audit firm Grant Thornton was appointed by IL&FS’ new board to conduct the review following the government’s decision to take charge of the group after its defaults on debt obligations sparked fears of financial contagion.  Grant Thornton reviewed the role of five credit rating agencies — Fitch group’s India Ratings and Research, the Indian affiliate of Moody’s, ICRA, Standard & Poor’s local unit Crisil, CARE Ratings and Brickwork Ratings India — which assigned 429 ratings to various IL&FS financial instruments in recent years. In a 105-page report, reviewed by Reuters on Saturday, Grant Thornton said the agencies raised multiple concerns on IL&FS group’s financial stress and liquidity position between June 2012 and June 2018, but continued to assign “consistently high” ratings which were only downgraded or reversed last year. “Various strategies deployed by the then key officials of IL&FS group and certain favours/gifts provided to rating agency officials suggest the possible reasons for consistent good ratings provided to IL&FS group,” said Grant Thornton in its report that detailed gifts or favours such as smartwatches and tickets to overseas sporting events.  IL&FS declined to comment. India Ratings said the Grant Thornton report is based on “partial and selective source material”, adding “our ratings were based on robust and transparent analysis of relevant information”. Brickwork said it did not assign the highest ratings to IL&FS “because it follows robust, transparent and consistent rating methodology” and its actions were not influenced by any commercial pressures or rating withdrawal requests. ICRA said it will determine an appropriate course of action and was examining the report, which it said ignores the “alleged fraud perpetrated by former IL&FS management”. Crisil and CARE did not immediately respond to a request for comment.     The IL&FS crisis that started last year has sparked a series of federal probes into the firm’s operations, but Grant Thornton’s report raises questions on whether rating agencies misled investors about the stress levels at other companies in India’s shadow banking sector, where new fractures are emerging. Dewan Housing Finance Corp, another top firm in the sector, last week warned its financial situation was dire, raising more worries about the sector’s health and signalling the crisis was far from over. “These instances show a glimpse into the incestuous financial services industry where quid pro quo has become the norm. The rot ... is deep and needs more cleansing,” said Shriram Subramanian, a corporate governance expert at proxy advisory firm InGovern.  Grant Thornton’s review of communication between former IL&FS employees and ratings agencies found the company at times “used to potentially pressurize” rating firms to withdraw their assessment if the company did not receive a favourable rating. It also found instances where credit rating agencies would meet with IL&FS employees and then decide not to downgrade the ratings they had initially decided on, the report said. “It appears that various potential strategies noted above were applied to ensure favorable ratings or to avoid the rating downgrade,” Grant Thornton said. Highlighting “potential favours/gifts”, Grant Thornton said various key officials at rating agencies received gifts such as smartwatches, shirts and coasters. E-mail communication showed a former IL&FS employee had facilitated the purchase of a villa at a steep discount for the wife of a senior Fitch executive, while another had arranged football tickets for a Brickwork Ratings executive to a Real Madrid game, the report added.  Brickwork said it had shared “a detailed response” on this specific allegation with IL&FS’ new management. Fitch in a statement said the employee involved had violated the agency’s code of conduct and was no longer employed. India’s market regulator has toughened regulations for credit rating agencies over the past three years to boost monitoring and bring clarity for investors. Following the IL&FS crisis, the regulator last month ordered enhanced disclosure norms for such agencies.

The video shows speedboats pulling up alongside the tanker, and troops wearing ski masks and carrying machine guns being lowered onto its deck from a helicopter. The same tactics were used by British Royal Marines to seize an Iranian oil tanker two weeks ago.",Reuters,"GENEVA/LONDON (Reuters) - Britain on Saturday denounced Iran’s seizure of a British-flagged oil tanker in the Gulf as a “hostile act” and rejected Tehran’s explanation that it seized the vessel because it had been involved in an accident. Iran’s Revolutionary Guards posted a video online showing speedboats pulling alongside the Stena Impero tanker, its name clearly visible. Troops wearing ski masks and carrying machine guns rappelled to its deck from a helicopter, the same tactics used by British Royal Marines to seize an Iranian tanker off the coast of Gibraltar two weeks ago. Friday’s action in the global oil trade’s most important waterway has been viewed in the West as a major escalation after three months of confrontation that has already taken Iran and the United States to the brink of war. It follows threats from Tehran to retaliate for Britain’s July 4 seizure of the Iranian tanker Grace 1, accused of violating sanctions on Syria. British Defence Secretary Penny Mordaunt called the incident a “hostile act”. Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt said he had expressed “extreme disappointment” by phone to his Iranian counterpart, Mohammad Javad Zarif. Britain also summoned the Iranian charge d’affaires in London. A spokesman for Iran’s Revolutionary Guards, Brigadier-General Ramezan Sharif, said Tehran had seized the ship in the Strait of Hormuz despite the “resistance and interference” of a British warship which had been escorting it. No British warship was visible in the video posted by the Guards. Iran’s Fars news agency said the Guards had taken control of the Stena Impero on Friday after it collided with an Iranian fishing boat whose distress call it ignored. The vessel, carrying no cargo, was taken to the Iranian port of Bandar Abbas. It will remain there with its 23 crew - 18 of them Indians - while the accident is investigated, Iranian news agencies quoted the head of Ports and Maritime Organisation in southern Hormozgan province, Allahmorad Afifipour, as saying. In a letter to the U.N. Security Council, Britain said the tanker was approached by Iranian forces when it was in Omani territorial waters exercising its lawful right of passage, and the action “constitutes illegal interference.” “Current tensions are extremely concerning, and our priority is to de-escalate. We do not seek confrontation with Iran,” the letter said. “But it is unacceptable and highly escalatory to threaten shipping going about its legitimate business through internationally recognized transit corridors.” Zarif told Hunt that the ship must go through a legal process before it can be released, Iran’s ISNA news agency reported. The strait, between Iran and the Arabian peninsula, is the sole outlet for exports of most Middle Eastern oil, and the seizure sent oil prices sharply higher. The United States, which tightened sanctions against Iran in May with the aim of halting its oil exports altogether, has been warning for months of an Iranian threat to shipping in the strait. U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said he also discussed the situation with Hunt, his British counterpart. “We talked about what they’ve seen, what they know, and how they’re beginning to think about how they will respond,” Pompeo said in an interview with the Washington Examiner that was published on Saturday by the State Department. “Iran is in a place today that they have taken themselves.” Another oil tanker, the Mesdar, was also boarded by Iranian personnel on Friday and temporarily forced to divert toward Iran, but later was allowed to continue on its route through the strait. On Saturday Algeria’s APS news agency said the Mesdar was owned by Algeria’s state oil company Sonatrach. France, Germany and the European Union joined Britain in condemning the seizure. The three big European countries are signatories to a 2015 nuclear deal between Tehran and world powers that Washington undermined by quitting last year, setting Iran’s already fragile relations with the West on a downward spiral. Under the pact, Iran agreed to restrict nuclear work in return for lifting sanctions. The European countries opposed the Trump administration’s decision to abandon the agreement last year, but have so far failed to fulfill promises to Iran of providing alternative means for it to access world trade. “Just spoke to ... Zarif and expressed extreme disappointment that having assured me last Saturday Iran wanted to de-escalate situation, they have behaved in the opposite way,” Hunt wrote on Twitter. “This has to be about actions not words if we are to find a way through.”  Earlier he said London’s reaction would be “considered but robust” and it would ensure the safety of its shipping. On Friday, Hunt said the solution would be found via diplomacy and London was “not looking at military options.” Britain’s government said it had advised British shipping to stay out of the Hormuz area for an interim period. During the past three months of escalation, the United States and Iran come as close as ever to direct armed conflict. In June, Tehran shot down a U.S. drone and President Donald Trump ordered retaliatory air strikes, only to call them off just minutes before were to have been carried out. The vessel had been heading to a port in Saudi Arabia and suddenly changed course after passing through the strait. The United States has blamed Iran for a series of attacks on shipping around the Strait of Hormuz. Tehran has rejected the allegations. Washington also said it had this week downed an Iranian drone near where the Stena Impero was seized.  The United States is sending military personnel and resources to Saudi Arabia for the first time since the U.S. invasion of Iraq in 2003.

91,7 killed as suicide bomber strikes hospital in Pakistan,"A suicide bomber, believed to be a woman, killed at least 7 people and wounded several others in an attack outside a local civilian hospital in Pakistan on Sunday. Officials said the blast had damaged the emergency ward of the hospital. The attack in Dera Ismail Khan was claimed by Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan, also known as the Pakistan Taliban.",Reuters,"DERA ISMAIL KHAN, Pakistan (Reuters) - A female suicide bomber in northwestern Pakistan killed at least eight people and wounded 26 more in an attack outside a local civilian hospital on Sunday, local officials said. The attack in Dera Ismail Khan early on Sunday was claimed by Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan, often known as the Pakistani Taliban, which is separate from the insurgent movement across the border in Afghanistan. Local officials said the attack happened after two police were killed at a roadside checkpoint outside the city. “When their bodies were taken to the main hospital, a suicide bomber, believed to be a female, wearing a burqa, triggered an explosive-laden jacket and caused huge losses,” said Waqar Ahmad, a local police officer. He said the blast had damaged the emergency ward of the hospital and forced some of the wounded to be transferred to other cities. Muhammed Khurasani, a spokesman for the TTP, claimed responsibility for the attack, which he said was carried out in revenge for the killing of two Taliban commanders by counter terrorism police around a month ago. However he denied the bomber was female. Dera Ismail Khan has seen a number of suicide attacks over the past decade as the Pakistani military carried out a campaign to suppress militant attacks in the area, an important hub in the $60 billion China Pakistan Economic Corridor.

92,US-S Korea military exercise to proceed despite N Korea's warning,"The secretary for peace planning to South Korean President Moon Jae-in, Jong Kun Choi, has said a US-South Korean military exercise would go ahead as planned next month. This comes despite North Korea's warning that the exercise will put talks aimed at getting the country to abandon its nuclear weapons at risk. ""The nature of exercise isn't offensive,"" Choi said.",Reuters,"ASPEN, Colo. (Reuters) - A top South Korean official on Saturday said a U.S.-South Korean military exercise would go ahead as planned next month, denying Pyongyang’s charges that holding it would breach an agreement made between U.S. President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. “The nature of the exercise is not offensive ... and is for strengthening the alliance,” Choi Jong-kun, the secretary for peace planning to South Korean President Moon Jae-in, told the Aspen Institute’s annual strategic forum. Later, speaking with Reuters, Choi said next month’s exercise would largely involve computer simulations and not troops in the field. The spokesman for North Korea’s Foreign Ministry said on Tuesday that Trump had reaffirmed in a meeting with Kim last month that joint exercises would be halted adding that the U.S. decision to proceed with them was “clearly a breach” of the leaders’ agreements made at a summit in Singapore last year. The spokesman said proceeding with war games was jeopardizing Pyongyang’s resumption of nuclear talks with the United States. The ministry said Washington’s pattern of “unilaterally reneging on its commitments” was leading Pyongyang to its commitment to discontinue tests of nuclear weapons and intercontinental ballistic missiles. U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo rejected the North Korean charges earlier this week. Speaking to the Aspen conference, Choi said that the United States would have consulted with his government had Trump agreed to suspend U.S.-South Korean war games during his talks last month with Kim on the border last month. “As far as I know, President Trump did not promise the cancellation of this upcoming military exercise,” said Choi. “If he had done that ... we would have been consulted and organized it and used it very strategically.” He noted that the United States and South Korea had suspended a large-scale exercise and canceled a second following the Singapore summit in June 2018 at which Trump sought to persuade Kim to end the development of nuclear weapons and eliminate his arsenal.  A second Trump-Kim summit in February failed to make any headway. The following month, the U.S. and South Korean militaries announced they were scaling back major war games - which Pyongyang long has denounced as preparations for war - and would hold smaller-scale exercises. Even so, Choi said, the preparedness of the U.S. and South Korean military to operate together had not been waned. “For the record, military interoperability has never been compromised,” he said.

113,Man who set fire to Japan studio played games non-stop: Neighbour,"The 41-year-old who set fire to a Japan animation studio, killing 34, lived alone in his apartment where he played games non-stop, according to his neighbour. He added music from video games blasted from Shinji Aoba's apartment at all hours. ""I've never seen him go out during the day...I would regularly hear him go out around midnight,"" the neighbour added.",Reuters,"OMIYA, Japan (Reuters) - The man suspected of killing 34 people in an arson attack in Japan lived alone, hundreds of kilometres from the torched Kyoto Animation studio, where he played video games non-stop and had “terrified” his neighbour just days earlier. Police late on Saturday issued an arrest warrant for 41-year-old Shinji Aoba, suspected of causing Japan’s worst mass killing in two decades on Thursday when he went to the studio in western Japan, poured fuel around the entrance and shouted “Die” as he set the building ablaze, according to public broadcaster NHK. They plan to arrest Aoba, who suffered serious burns and on Saturday was airlifted to a university hospital for treatment, once he recovers, NHK said.  Police said Aoba had previously been convicted of robbing a shop. Aoba lived alone on the ground floor of a two-floor apartment building on the outskirts of Omiya, a commuter suburb of Tokyo and some 500 km (310 miles) east of Kyoto. His next-door neighbour recalled Aoba as pudgy and unkempt, with blemished skin. He kept odd hours and barely spoke to anyone.  “I’ve never seen him go out during the day, not even to the convenience store. I would regularly hear him go out around midnight,” the neighbour, a 27-year-old man who declined to be identified, told Reuters. Music from video games blared from Aoba’s apartment at all hours, the neighbour said, adding that there had been complaints from residents about the noise in the last year. On July 14, days before the attack, Aoba grabbed and threatened the neighbour over an apparent misunderstanding. It started when Aoba began pounding on the wall to complain about noise, the neighbour said. When the neighbour went to Aoba’s front door to tell him the noise was coming from another unit, he heard a loud wail inside the apartment and then the door opened. “When he came out of his apartment, his eyes were bloodshot, and he started yelling at me to my face to shut up,” the neighbour said. “He grabbed me by the collar and started pulling my hair. It was terrifying.” After the Kyoto attack, Aoba told police he had done it because the studio had plagiarised his novel, Kyodo news reported. Kyoto Animation is well known in Japan and abroad for its series and movies, including “Violet Evergarden”, which has been on Netflix.  Aoba had lived in the Omiya apartment for about three years, the neighbour said. Japanese media said he had moved into it at some point following his release from his prison for robbing a convenience store east of Tokyo in 2012. He had also received care for mental illness, NHK said. The apartment block is typical of the prefab apartments that crowd Japanese commuter suburbs: small, identical units, built with thin walls. Single air conditioners rest on narrow balconies outside each unit. The apartments are usually meant for single occupants and are popular with lower-income and younger workers.   Residents in the area - a rural subdivision off a busy road where recently built homes and unkempt vegetable patches fight for space with a tiny cemetery - said they were shocked by the news of the arson. “I’ve lived here all my life, and until very recently, this area has never had any incidents of violence, or talk of violent people living in the neighbourhood,” said an engineer in his 20s en route to visit his parents who live near Aoba’s apartment. “It’s unsettling.”  Reporting by Naomi Tajitsu; Editing by David Dolan and Clare Fallon",https://in.reuters.com/article/japan-fire-suspect-idINKCN1UF0D8?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=5d3341adb9415600019b1334&utm_source=inshorts

Imports for power plants at Gujarat's Mundra made up 42% of all imports by Indian utilities during the first six months. Imports by Adani Power's Mundra plant more than quadrupled to 9.01 million tonnes.",Reuters,"NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Coal imports by Indian coal utilities during the first half of 2019 rose 53.4% from a year earlier to 35.47 million tonnes, data provided by India’s Central Electricity Authority (CEA) showed. Demand for seaborne coal imports in India has risen because of a fast rising population and the unavailability of alternative fuels such as natural gas. Imports for power plants at the port of Mundra, in western India’s state of Gujarat, made up 42% of all imports by Indian utilities during the first half of 2019. Imports by Adani Power Ltd’s  Mundra plant more than quadrupled from a year earlier to 9.01 million tonnes, while coal shipments by Tata Power Ltd’s utility rose over 6% to 6.07 million tonnes. The utilities have been ramping up imports of thermal coal after India’s top court in October eased their earlier stance and paved the way for passing on increased generation costs to consumers. The power plants were forced to cut imports and slash electricity generation after the court barred them from increasing prices for customers in 2016, after their coal supplier Indonesia raised the price of coal. NTPC Ltd, India’s largest electricity generator, shipped in 1.4 million tonnes of coal to various ports during six months ended June 2019, about 11 times of what it imported a year ago. Coal is among the top five commodities imported by India, and about three-fifths of its thermal coal imports come from Indonesia, while less than one-sixth is imported from South Africa. Thermal coal imports rose at the fastest pace in four years in 2018, after two straight years of decline. Indian utilities are importing more as the government has failed to open the industry to competition because bureaucratic indecision and resistance from unions has stalled the passage of a liberalization policy approved by the country’s cabinet 16 months ago. Higher Indian coal imports are a boon for international miners such as Indonesia’s Adaro Energy, U.S. coal miner Peabody Energy Corp and global commodity merchants such as Glencore PLC. They also undercut efforts by Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government to cut imports and place additional burdens on India’s debt-ridden thermal power sector.

139,India may engage foreign lenders for loans to small firms,"The government is reportedly in talks with foreign lenders to provide as much as ₹1 lakh crore in credit to the country's small enterprises. It is in discussions with multiple foreign lenders, including Germany's state-owned development bank KfW Group, the World Bank and some Canadian institutions. World Bank has said the discussions with the government were in the early stages.",Reuters,"NEW DELHI (Reuters) - The government is in talks with foreign lenders to provide as much as $14.5 billion in credit to millions of its small firms, two officials said, in a sign the country’s banking system may not be robust enough to do the job on its own. The government is in discussions with multiple foreign lenders, including Germany’s state-owned development bank KfW Group, the World Bank and some Canadian institutions to extend lines of credit to small enterprises, one of the officials, who did not want to be identified, told Reuters. KfW’s India office confirmed the discussions, though the main focus was on credit lines to support small businesses’ solar power generation. The talks were at an early stage, KfW said. A spokesman for World Bank in India on Saturday said the discussions with the government were in the early stages, adding that “further rounds of consultations will help us define the contours of this collaboration”. The official said the government plans to source up to 1 trillion Indian rupees of loans from foreign institutions because Indian banks were not in a position to provide enough capital for the small business sector, which is seen as critical to job creation. “We are exploring, we are having discussions with various funding agencies if something can be done (for small and medium firms),” the second official said. The officials did not provide full details of the discussions they are having with banks, or identify all those they are talking to, but said talks are at a very early stage. India’s micro, small and medium enterprise (MSME) ministry is discussing the proposal to pull in foreign banks with the country’s ministry of finance, which will make a final call, the second official said. The push for foreign loans comes on the heels of the Indian government’s announcement earlier this month that it plans to borrow about 700 billion rupees by issuing overseas sovereign bonds. India’s 63 million firms in the micro, small and medium firm sector are responsible for more than a quarter of the country’s manufacturing and services output, and must be re-energised for Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government to kick-start the economy.  Gross domestic product growth fell to a five-year low of 5.8% in the January-March quarter, well below the 8%-plus rates that the government is targeting. But credit availability for small and medium firms, which also account for about 45% of India’s total exports, has worsened due to a liquidity crisis in the country’s shadow banking industry that has seen big lenders struggling to remain solvent.   State-owned banks, which dominate the sector, have not been able to drive increased lending because they are burdened with more than $145 billion in bad loans. This has led to a severe credit squeeze for smaller firms. They pay up to 17% annual interest on loans from banks, while the shadow banks, which are also known as non-banking financial companies (NBFCS) can charge as much as 20%. Last month, a study by a Reserve Bank of India panel said the overall deficit in credit for the MSME sector is estimated at about 20 trillion rupees to 25 trillion rupees.     But lending to such firms can be risky as some lack proper financial information, such as historical cash flow data, which makes it challenging for banks to assess the credit risks. To mitigate such risks for foreign banks, the loans would be given sovereign guarantees and be routed through Indian government agencies such as the Small Industries Development Bank of India, the first official said.

The final list of prospective applicants will be issued on Aug. 14 and the resolution plans have to be submitted by Sept. 5, it said.The step to seek resolution proposals may give creditors a chance to recover some of their dues. Last month the National Company Law Tribunal agreed to hear an insolvency case and once Jet Airways is declared bankrupt the chances of any meaningful recovery by the banks diminish.The carrier, once the nation’s biggest by market value, hasn’t flown since April after running out of cash. Jet Airways, which successfully took on the monopoly of state-run Air India Ltd. in the early 1990s, fell victim to a cut-throat price war initiated by a slew of budget carriers and eventually defaulted to banks, staff and lessors.Almost 17,000 creditors of the carrier, including its former chief executive officer, have claimed 248.9 billion rupees ($3.6 billion) in dues. Most of Jet’s employees, including the chief executive officer and the chief financial officer, and hundreds of pilots and crew, have already left the company. Abu Dhabi’s Etihad Airways PJSC owns 24% of the carrier.Banks have held talks with several potential investors, from Etihad Airways PJSC to Indian conglomerate Tata Group, without any success. Etihad was the only bidder in an auction process, but its offer was conditional on another investor pumping in most of the required cash. Some of Etihad’s conditions can only be met through a bankruptcy process, by allowing it to sidestep certain securities regulations, the lenders have said.Get live Stock Prices from BSE and NSE and latest NAV, portfolio of Mutual Funds, calculate your tax by Income Tax Calculator, know market’s Top Gainers, Top Losers & Best Equity Funds.

160,Punjab CM Amarinder Singh accepts Navjot Singh Sidhu's resignation,Punjab Chief Minister Captain Amarinder Singh has accepted Navjot Singh Sidhu's resignation as a state minister. Sidhu had also sent his resignation letter dated June 10 to then-Congress President Rahul Gandhi. Punjab CM had divested Sidhu of the Local Government and Tourism and Cultural Affairs Departments and allotted him the Power and New and Renewable Energy Sources portfolios last month.,The Financial Express,"Days after Navjot Singh Sidhu resigned from the state cabinet, Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh Saturday accepted his “one-line” resignation. The chief minister has sent the resignation to Governor V P Singh Badnore for formal acceptance, an official spokesperson said here.Amarinder, who had been indisposed for the last two days, since arrival from Delhi on Wednesday, saw the resignation letter Saturday morning, the spokesperson said.The letter, however, was just a single sentence tendering Sidhu’s resignation, with no explanation or elaboration, he added.Punjab chief minister accepted Sidhu’s resignation at a time when there were speculation in the media that the Congress high command intervened in the matter for the resolution of the issue between both the leaders.The 55-year-old Sidhu, who has been at loggerheads with Amarinder, was stripped off key portfolios in the cabinet reshuffle on June 6. Punjab CM had divested Sidhu of the Local Government and Tourism and Cultural Affairs Departments and allotted him the power and new and renewable energy portfolio.Notably, apart from Sidhu, the portfolios of other ministers were also changed.The refusal to assume the charge of the power department by Sidhu for more than a month also came as an “embarrassment” to Congress with opposition parties attacking Amarinder-led regime in the state.Cricketer-turned-politician took to his Twitter handle on July 14, making public his June 10 resignation letter from the state cabinet addressed to then Congress president Rahul Gandhi, which was sent just four days after his portfolio was changed.On July 15, Sidhu has sent his resignation letter to Amarinder’s official residence here while CM was in Delhi.Amarinder on Tuesday in Delhi had said that he would decide on Sidhu’s resignation after going through the contents of the resignation letter once he reached Chandigarh. Chief Minister returned to Chandigarh Wednesday evening.Earlier this week, Amarinder in Delhi had said if Sidhu did not want to do his job, there was nothing he could do about it.In the absence of Sidhu, Amarinder has been monitoring the functioning of the power department in the wake of ongoing crucial paddy sowing season and rising power demand during hot and humid weather conditions in the state.Ever since the portfolio reshuffle exercise, Sidhu and his wife Navjot Kaur have been maintaining a distance from the media.The tension between Punjab CM and Sidhu had come out in the open in May when Amarinder blamed Sidhu for the “inept handling” of the Local Government Department, claiming that it resulted in “poor performance” of the Congress in urban areas in the Lok Sabha polls.The cricketer-turned-politician, however, had said his department was being “singled out publicly” while asserting that he could not be taken for granted as he had been a “performer throughout.”Sidhu had even approached the then Congress president Rahul Gandhi on June 9 and had “apprised him of the situation” besides handing over a letter to him.Sidhu, a former BJP leader who had joined the Congress just ahead of the 2017 Punjab assembly polls, has been at loggerheads with Amarinder for sometime now.During Lok Sabha polls, Amarinder had taken umbrage at Sidhu’s “friendly match” jibe during electioneering in Bathinda on May 17. Sidhu had allegedly cornered the Congress government in the state over the issue of the desecration of religious texts, questioning why no FIR was lodged against the Badals, who ran the previous government in the state.This had evoked sharp reaction from Amarinder. Hitting out at Sidhu, the chief minister had said, “If he was a real Congressman, he should have chosen a better time to air his grievances, instead of just ahead of voting in Punjab.”“He is harming the party with such irresponsible actions. It is not his election but that of the entire Congress,” he had said. “Perhaps he is ambitious and wants to be the chief minister,” Amarinder had said.Earlier also, the tension between Amarinder and Sidhu had come out in the public. Last year, Sidhu had said in Hyderabad, “(Congress chief) Rahul Gandhi is my captain…Rahul Gandhi is the captain of the captain (Amarinder) also.” Amarinder had also disapproved of Sidhu hugging the Pakistan Army chief during his visit to the neighbouring country.Get live Stock Prices from BSE and NSE and latest NAV, portfolio of Mutual Funds, calculate your tax by Income Tax Calculator, know market’s Top Gainers, Top Losers & Best Equity Funds.

163,Trump offers to help ease tensions in Japan-South Korea dispute,"US President Donald Trump on Friday offered to help ease tensions in the political and economic dispute between Japan and South Korea. ""It's like a full-time job getting involved with Japan and South Korea. But I like leaders of both the countries,"" Trump said. The dispute threatens global supplies of memory chips and smartphones.",Reuters,"WASHINGTON/SEOUL (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump on Friday offered to help ease tensions in the political and economic dispute between Japan and South Korea, which threatens global supplies of memory chips and smartphones. Lingering tension, particularly over the issue of compensation for South Koreans forced to work for Japanese occupiers during World War Two, took a turn for the worse this month when Japan restricted exports of high-tech materials to South Korea. The United States has been hesitant to publicly wade into the feud between its two biggest allies in Asia. Trump said South Korean President Moon Jae-in had asked him if he could get involved. “He tells me that they have a lot of friction going on now with respect to trade, primarily with respect to trade. And Japan has some things that South Korea wants, and he asked me to get involved,” Trump told reporters at the White House. “So maybe if they would both want me to, I’ll be. It’s like a full-time job getting involved with Japan and South Korea. But I like both leaders.” South Korea’s presidential Blue House spokeswoman, Ko Min-jung, said in a statement on Saturday that Moon had asked Trump for help at their Seoul summit on June 30. Ko said Moon talked to Trump in an effort to diplomatically solve the issue as Japanese media, at the time, constantly reported the possibility of economic retaliation against South Korea.  David Stilwell, the top U.S. diplomat for East Asia policy, said in Seoul on Wednesday that he took the situation seriously but did not elaborate on what steps Washington might take and said it was fundamentally up to South Korea and Japan to resolve their differences. Japan has denied that the dispute over compensation is behind the export curbs, even though one of its ministers cited broken trust with South Korea over the labor dispute in announcing the restrictions. Instead, Japan has cited “inadequate management” of sensitive items exported to South Korea, with Japanese media reporting some items ended up in North Korea. South Korea has denied that. The export curbs could hurt global technology companies.

ASI authorities had requested more security, citing the Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Sites and Remains Act which prevents any kind of religious practice and beginning of new tradition at protected monuments.",India.com,"New Delhi: The district administration of Agra has agreed to beef up security outside the Taj Mahal at the request of Archaeological Survey of India (ASI), following Shiv Sena’s threat of performing ‘aarti’ at the monument on each Monday of the holy month of ‘Sawan’.The ASI authorities wrote a letter stating that under the provisions of the Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Sites and Remains Act, 1958 any kind of religious practice and beginning of a new tradition in the protected monument is against the rules of the Act.Agra Shiv Sena President Veenu Lavania on July 17 challenged the district administration and police to stop him and his aides from offering ‘aarti’ at the Taj Mahal.Lavania had said: “Taj Mahal is not a mausoleum but Tejo Mahalaya, a temple of Lord Shiva. We will perform ‘aarti’ at Tejo Mahalaya on every Monday of ‘Sawan’.”The Superintending Archaeologist of ASI of Agra circle, Vasant Swarankar, said that no ‘aarti’ or ‘puja’ has ever been performed in the Taj Mahal.“We have requested the district authorities to make proper security arrangements outside the Taj Mahal,” he said.Additional District Magistrate (ADM) K.P.

The incident came to light when the smoke alarm inside the Ranchi-bound flight went off. The accused has not been charged under the non-bailable section for the offence so far.,The Financial Express,"A passenger from Jharkhand has been arrested for allegedly smoking in the lavatory of an IndiGo Airlines flight (6E 485). The man who was aboard the Ranchi-bound flight on Friday has been identified as Deepak Kumar Sharma who belongs to Jharkhand’s Hazaribagh is facing up to 3 months jail or Rs one lakh fine for the offence.This has also put a question mark on the airport security arrangement wherein the accused passenger should not have been able to pass through with a matchbox or a cigarette lighter.According to the police, the incident came to light when the smoke alarm inside the Airbus 320 aircraft which landed in Ranchi at around 2.30 pm went off, as per a report by the Hindustan Times. Sharma could possibly have to pay a penalty of up to Rs 1 lakh or spend up to three months in jail for putting the aircraft at risk, says the report.As per Section 25 of the Aircraft Act, the operator or the owner and the pilot who is in command of every aircraft registered in the country shall display a notice in the aircraft at prominent place stating where and to what extent smoking is prohibited or permitted inside the premises. Smoking is prohibited in all parts of the aircraft and in its vicinity and no person shall smoke “anywhere in an aircraft during take-off, landing or refuelling or during a period in which a notice is temporarily displayed indicating that smoking is prohibited.”At first, Sharma was detained by the Central Industrial Security Force (CISF), which is responsible for airport security.

192,Benjamin Netanyahu becomes longest-serving Israeli PM,"Benjamin Netanyahu has become Israel's longest-serving Prime Minister, surpassing the record set by the country's founding father and first leader David Ben-Gurion. As of Saturday, Netanyahu has spent 4,876 days – more than 13 years – in office. Netanyahu won his first election in 1996, becoming Israel's youngest-ever Prime Minister at the age of 46.",The Guardian,"Benjamin Netanyahu has become Israel‘s longest-serving prime minister, snatching the title from the country’s founding father and first leader, David Ben-Gurion.As of Saturday, the man referred to as King Bibi by both those who adore and detest him, has spent 4,867 days – more than 13 years – in office.During the past two decades, the now-69-year-old former commando has repeatedly won elections on promises of making Israel secure and prosperous, while sidelining the Palestinians.“He has convinced many voters that he is irreplaceable,” said Gideon Rahat, a political science professor at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem and senior fellow at the Israel Democracy Institute.Despite passing the historic milestone, Netanyahu still needs to win a September election and survive three impending corruption cases to continue his long tenure.His supporters claim Israel has never been richer, safer or more globally accepted, including by leaders of Arab states. Critics argue he has opened fissures in Israeli society, stigmatised minorities to win elections, crushed progressive and human rights activism and encouraged the rise of far-right politics into government.In the latest election in April, he was accused of appealing to racist voters when he stated Israel was “not a state of all its citizens”, referring to the country’s minority population of Palestinian citizens. Netanyahu later made an election pact with a group of far-right extremists called Jewish Power.In his party, the rightwing Likud, Netanyahu has remained at the top, even when it appeared scandals and crises might take him down.“He is very talented at not letting any challenger grow within his party. Any person that looked even close to being popular was somehow kicked out or neutralised,” Rahat said. “Nobody was seen as a replacement for him.”In 1996, Netanyahu became Israel’s youngest prime minister, running on a platform against flailing peace attempts, especially the Oslo accords that gave some limited autonomy to the Palestinians.Under his leadership, control over Palestinian life has become entrenched. The military occupation of the West Bank is tightly managed, while Jewish settlement construction has spread, giving Netanyahu support from hawkish and pro-settler sections of society.Orit Galili-Zucker, a political communications adviser who has worked with Netanyahu, said the prime minister had since made “no courageous decision on the Israeli-Arab conflict. Israel remained stuck and he personally profited from his zero progress.”Netanyahu had also managed to stay in power for so long, she said, by not embarking on grand military campaigns that resulted in large numbers of Israeli casualties, such as the 2006 Lebanon war headed by his predecessor, Ehud Olmert.And as a man who made his break in politics as an affable English-speaking Israeli diplomat, he had excelled, she said, in campaigning and using TV and social media to rally support.Yet Netanyahu could see his extraordinary run in power cut short before the end of the year.One month after appearing to win the election, he failed to form a coalition government. Rather than risk losing the premiership to another contender, he chose to push parliament to disband and force another national vote. Fresh polls are set for 17 September, the first time the country has held two elections in one year.Famed for 11th-hour brinkmanship and daring political gambits, many expect Netanyahu to win. But even then, he faces possibly the biggest challenge of his political career to date: the prospect of three corruption indictments.Just weeks after the election, he will be called to a pre-trial hearing. Israel’s attorney general has already recommended he be indicted.One case involves allegations of receiving gifts, including cigars and champagne from international billionaires, allegedly in exchange for favours. In another, Netanyahu was accused of colluding with the country’s top-selling newspaper to hurt its competition in exchange for favourable coverage.A third case involves allegations that Netanyahu offered incentives to the Israeli telecoms provider Bezeq in exchange for positive stories on a news website it owns.Netanyahu has denied all accusations, dismissing them as a witch-hunt orchestrated by the media. He is not legally required to step down unless he is convicted and all his appeals are rejected.… we have a small favour to ask.

Pelli's other works include the World Financial Center in New York, Canary Wharf Tower in London and renovation work on New York's Museum of Modern Art. Pelli had served as the dean of Yale University's School of Architecture.",Reuters,"BUENOS AIRES (Reuters) - César Pelli, the Argentine designer behind the iconic Petronas Twin Towers in Malaysia, has died aged 92, state media and officials said on Friday, marking the passing of one of the contemporary architectural greats. Pelli, who grew up in Argentina and studied architecture at the University of Tucumán in the country’s far northwest, established himself as a visionary and educator, making a name for himself in the United States where his main studio was based. Argentina’s Telam state news agency reported his passing on Friday, as did the governor of Tucuman province, where Pelli grew up and spent his formative years. “With much regret we receive the sad news of the death of the great Architect César Pelli,” the region’s governor, Juan Manzur, said in a post on Twitter. “I want to convey my condolences to his whole family, his friends and his team.” “He was without doubt a creator and his legacy will endure forever in each of his works.” In 1977, Pelli became dean of Yale University’s School of Architecture and founded Cesar Pelli & Associates, according to a biography on the website of the New Haven, Connecticut-based studio, since renamed Pelli Clarke Pelli, which lists offices in New York, Abu Dhabi, San Francisco, Tokyo and Shanghai. Along with the Petronas Towers, at the time the tallest buildings in the world, Pelli’s famous works include the World Financial Center in New York, Canary Wharf Tower in London and renovation work on New York’s Museum of Modern Art. Reuters could not immediately reach his firm for comment.

196,Will work to free rapper A$AP Rocky from detention in Sweden: Trump,"US President Donald Trump has said he'll be working to free rapper A$AP Rocky, who's in police custody in Sweden. ""I'll be calling the very talented Prime Minister of Sweden to see what we can do about helping Rocky,"" Trump tweeted. The rapper, whose real name is Rakim Mayers, was arrested over his alleged involvement in a fight in Stockholm.",The Guardian,"Donald Trump has said he is working to free the American rapper A$AP Rocky, who has been held in police custody in Sweden for weeks.“I will be calling the very talented Prime Minister of Sweden to see what we can do about helping A$AP Rocky,” Trump tweeted from aboard Air Force One on Friday, and said he had just spoken with Kanye West about Rocky’s situation.“So many people would like to see this quickly resolved!” Trump said.Rocky, a platinum-selling, Grammy-nominated artist whose real name is Rakim Mayers, has been in police custody since early July as Swedish police investigate his alleged involvement in a fight in Stockholm that occurred before his appearance at a music festival. Videos published on social media appear to show a person being violently thrown onto the ground by Rocky. A defense lawyer has said he acted in self-defense.Congressman Adriano Espaillat, of New York, has been pushing for the rapper’s release and has been in contact with the state department and the US embassy in Sweden. Rocky is originally from the neighborhood of Harlem in New York City.The case has earned the attention of a slew of celebrities, including Sean “Diddy” Combs, Justin Bieber, Jada Pinkett Smith, Nicki Minaj and Post Malone.Kim Kardashian West encouraged Trump to take action to free Rocky. Kardashian West has previously worked with the Trump administration on criminal justice reform issues.One senior administration official, speaking to the Associated Press on condition of anonymity to outline private conversations, said Kardashian West had reached out to Trump’s son-in-law and senior adviser, Jared Kushner, whom she has worked with closely, to tell him about the situation on behalf of her husband, a supporter of the president.Kushner then briefed Trump, according to the official, who said Trump felt the case was worth looking into and directed his secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, to see what could be done.The state department said Friday that it was following the case but declined to provide details, citing privacy considerations. Providing assistance to US citizens detained abroad is one of the department’s most important functions, it said.Kardashian West thanked Trump, Pompeo and Kushner via Twitter, along with “everyone involved with the efforts to Free ASAP Rocky & his two friends”.“Your commitment to justice reform is so appreciated,” she wrote on Thursday.Rocky’s lawyer, Slobodan Jovicic, told the Associated Press that his client was aware of the president’s comments and “is very thankful for everyone who has reached out to show their support”.“It means a lot to him, but we are focused on the case that we have in front of us,” he added.Trump did not mention Kardashian West or Kushner to reporters in the Oval Office on Friday and said it was his wife, Melania Trump, who had originally brought the case to his attention.“She was telling me about, ‘Can you help A$AP Rocky?’” said Trump, who said he had also heard from others.“Many, many members of the African American community have called me, friends of mine, and said, ‘Could you help?’ So I personally don’t know A$AP Rocky, but I can tell you that he has tremendous support from the African American community in this country,” he said.“We’ll be talking to them,” Trump said, referring to Swedish officials. “We’ve already started.”“We’re working with the state department, and we hope to get him home soon,” added the first lady.The Ohio pastor Darrell Scott, a longtime Trump supporter who is African American and has worked with the administration on urban justice issues, said he was among those who raised the issue with Trump last Friday night after Rocky’s management reached out for assistance.“We know that this is a high priority for the president and the state department, at the instruction of the president,” said Kareem Lanier, the co-chair of the Urban Revitalization Coalition who credited the White House with ensuring Rocky was moved to better holding conditions.Both Lanier and Scott rejected the idea that Trump was calling attention to the issue to distract from criticism of his attacks against four Democratic congresswomen of color, noting the administration had been working on the issue before the latest brouhaha.They applauded Trump for shining attention on the issue.“Any time President Trump gets involved in anything, it brings a level of attention” to an issue that cannot be matched by those who “don’t have that cache or reach”, Lanier said.Stockholm’s district court decided on Friday that Rocky would remain in custody another week to allow police to complete their investigation. They have until 25 July.Jovicic, Rocky’s attorney, said he felt the decision was “unjust”, but remained confident in his case.The Associated Press contributed reporting… we have a small favour to ask.

198,Humans are children of sages not monkeys: BJP MP,"BJP MP Satya Pal Singh on Friday said that humans are 'special manufacturing of nature' and are the children of Indian sages. ""I don't want to hurt the sentiments of those who think they're the children of monkeys,"" he added. Earlier, Singh had dismissed Darwin's evolution theory by saying that no one has seen an ape turn into a man.",India.com,"New Delhi: BJP MP Satya Pal Singh famous for dismissing Darwin’s evolution theory in the past by remarking ‘no one saw an ape turn into a man’ dropped another bomb on Friday while speaking in the Lok Sabha.Hitting out at the Opposition over their protests on The Protection of Human Rights (Amendment) Bill, 2019, he emphasised that Indian culture never talked about human rights rather focused on the holistic development of human character.Satya Pal Singh, who is a former Mumbai Police chief then added, “Humans are special manufacturing of nature. We think that we are the children of Indian sages. I don’t want to hurt the sentiments of those who think that they are the children of monkeys.”Opposing his statement were TMC’s Mahua Moitra and DMK’s Kanimozhi, who voiced their apprehensions strongly.On being objected in the House, Singh retorted, “Only those who don’t understand the cost of human rights do this.”Further elaborating, “Our religion says that everybody should be happy and healthy. Not only human beings, but every living being should be seen as friends. We talk about ”Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam”, not only about human beings. Human rights are foreign thinking.”Later on, he accused several non-profit organisations of receiving funds from foreign groups and supporting ‘anti-national activities’.The Protection of Human Rights (Amendment) Bill, 2019, was passed in the Lok Sabha even as several MPs objected to it. The Bill aims to change the constitution of the National Human Rights Commission and state rights bodies.",https://www.india.com/news/india/humans-are-children-of-sages-not-monkeys-another-gem-by-bjp-mp-satya-pal-singh-3721956/?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts
199,"BJP, Cong equally responsible for atrocities on tribals: Mayawati","BSP's Mayawati on Friday targetted BJP and Congress on Sonbhadra firing incident and held both the parties equally responsible for the atrocities on tribals. ""What needs to be stressed upon is that whoever is out of power among the two, sheds crocodile tears whenever there are (such) cases,"" she said. As many as 10 tribals were killed in the incident.",The Financial Express,"BSP chief Mayawati on Friday hit out at both the national parties — BJP and Congress — for Sonbhadra incident in which 10 tribals including three women lost their lives. The BSP president said that both the parties are equally responsible for atrocities committed on the people belonging to the tribal community. She also said that the Congress during its rule ousted tribals from forest and some of them later became Naxals.“The Congress and BJP governments at the Centre are equally responsible for the atrocities committed on tribals in the country. The tribals were ousted from the forest during Congress rule and some of them even became Naxals,” she said. The BSP chief said that now the members of the Kol/adivasi samaj were removed from Sonbhadra and killed during BJP rule. “But what needs to be stressed is that whoever is out of power among these two parties, sheds crocodile tears whenever there are cases of atrocities,” she added.Mayawati’s statement comes on a day when Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi was detained on her way to Sonbhadra where 10 people were allegedly gunned down by a village head and his henchmen. The Congress leader was scheduled to meet the family of the victims but was stopped in Mirzapur, UP. In an apparent reference to today’s development, Mayawati said that the Congress was doing all this days after the incident but the BSP started pressurising the administration to do justice ever since the incident happened.Former Congress President Rahul Gandhi today called the detention of Priyanka Gandhi as ‘illegal’ and ‘disturbing’. Priyanka Gandhi’s husband Robert Vadra in a social media post termed the detention as ‘completely unconstitutional’. “No documents were produced for the arrest…This is a complete abuse of law in every respect,” he said. He further said that the state government should immediately release her and let democracy be a democracy and not a dictatorship.Get live Stock Prices from BSE and NSE and latest NAV, portfolio of Mutual Funds, calculate your tax by Income Tax Calculator, know market’s Top Gainers, Top Losers & Best Equity Funds.

201,Rajiv’s error will be repeated if triple talaq not criminalised: Arif,Ex-Union Minister Arif Mohammad Khan on Friday said the Prime Minister Modi-led government will repeat the mistake committed by the Rajiv Gandhi-led government in the Shah Bano case if triple talaq is not criminalised. The Rajiv Gandhi government introduced a bill in 1986 reversing Supreme Court’s order saying triple talaq victim has the right to demand maintenance from her ex-husband.,The Financial Express,"Batting for criminalising the practice of triple talaq, former Union minister Arif Mohammad Khan on Friday said that if it is not done the Modi government will be committing the same mistake as Rajiv Gandhi did in the Shah Bano case. Without naming the Congress, Khan said the party that had won over 400 seats in 1984 was suffering from the “curse of the destitute”. “What was Shah Bano given? Rs 147 to keep her body and soul together. The curse of destitute is haunting” them, he said. Khan said he wrote a six-page letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi in October last year, requesting him to criminalise the practice of triple talaq.“In the letter, I explained to him how in 1986 by enacting a law we reversed the judgement of the Supreme Court and now if we do not enact a law to ensure that the judgement of the Supreme Court is followed in letter and spirit, if we fail to make a law to criminalise triple talaq then we would be making the same mistake that was committed in 1986,” he said.Also read: Congress ousted tribals from forest, now shedding crocodile tears: MayawatiDelivering a lecture here on ‘Why triple talaq should be made a punishable offence’, Khan said a lot of “churning is taking place in Rajya Sabha” over the passage of the Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Marriage) Bill 2019. “I am hopeful that this time the ordinance criminalising triple talaq would be passed by Rajya Sabha as there is a lot of churning taking place and people are talking about what happened in 1986 (Shah Bano case),” he said.Khan was a minister of state in the Rajiv Gandhi government in 1986 but he resigned over the government’s stand in the Shah Bano case. Shah Bano was a Muslim woman from Indore. Divorced by her husband in 1978, she filed a criminal suit in court and won the right to alimony from her husband. Her husband had challenged the lower court’s order in the Supreme Court which upheld the lower court’s order. However, the then Rajiv Gandhi government brought a bill – Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Divorce) Act, 1986 in Parliament to reverse the judgment.Khan had openly opposed the government’s decision to bring a bill in Parliament to reverse the Supreme Court’s order that the victim of the triple talaq has right to demand maintenance from her ex-husband under Section 125 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 which applies to all citizens regardless of caste or religion. Strongly supporting criminalisation of the practice of triple talaq, Khan said there is absolutely no doubt that if it becomes a proper law then it would help in upholding the dignity of women. He said the common argument given to oppose its criminalisation is that it is a matter of civil law not criminal.“What these eloquently speaking men do not understand is that divorce is a civil matter and no one, neither a Hindu nor a Muslim, would be jailed for divorcing his wife but the practice of Triple Talaq is criminal,” he said. The Supreme Court had in 2017 banned the practice of triple talaq. But since the practice was still prevalent, a bill was brought to make it a penal offence. With the dissolution of the 16th Lok Sabha last month, the bill had lapsed as it was pending in Rajya Sabha.The Bill, which proposes to make the practice of instant triple talaq (talaq-e-biddat) a penal offence, had faced objections from the opposition parties which claimed that jail term for a man for divorcing his wife was legally untenable. A fresh bill, Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Marriage) Bill, 2019, has now been introduced in Lok Sabha to replace an ordinance issued in February by the previous BJP-led NDA government.The new bill is a copy of the ordinance in force. The government had promulgated the ordinance on triple talaq twice — in September 2018 and in February 2019 — as the contentious bill remained pending in Rajya Sabha Under the Bill, divorcing through instant triple talaq is illegal, void and will attract a jail term of three years for the husband.Get live Stock Prices from BSE and NSE and latest NAV, portfolio of Mutual Funds, calculate your tax by Income Tax Calculator, know market’s Top Gainers, Top Losers & Best Equity Funds.
